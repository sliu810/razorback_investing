Kantrowitz: Not time to panic around Microsoft; AI story is still working,2024-07-31 06:03:19-05:00,5,1XyOF-fQQ_g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XyOF-fQQ_g,"joining us for this and much  more, the big technology founder and cnbc contributor, alex, good morning. always good to see you. it appears the stocks are  falling on the slight miss. big deal? not a big deal? >> i don't see it as a big deal. it's going to pull up. if you thought the ai story was  working yesterday, it's still  working today. in the call, they talked about  the fact this was a capacity  issue, right? there's hardware that's needed  to enable customers to build  itself ai technology and it's in short supply. that was the thing slowing the  growth. it still contributed to iowa,  still contributed to azure's  growth in the quarter. i don't think it's changed at  all or very much.  >> what you're saying has been  echoed by a number of analysts. he said basic ally according to  microsoft, they grew 60% quarter over quarter and they also saw  an increase in 10,000 seat  deployments, basically  enterprise customers. is that being overlooked the  fact that this ai co-pilot story that's pushed the markets all  year long, we're starting to see adoption and seeing people  actually 2350i7b8ding use cases? >> there was exuberance earlier  on. a company doesn't add a trillion particulars in market cap. if there isn't some exuberance  in the ai story thinking this  can change the world in a  minute. but if you think about the  stats, these deployments take  time. there's a lot of changed mask. companies have to figure out how it works in their work flow, and that means gradual change. when you see this adoption of  co-pilot, which is happening  seat by seat in the enterprise,  that's a good sign and it shows  this stuff is going to  incrementally move it for  companies that adopted and over  time add up to a big story. so i think that adds to the  broader story.  >> i want to look ahead if you  don't mind. meta. we have two -- actually three of the magnificent seven report. two of them, microsoft and  alphabet slowed. is any of this a read when it  comes to meta? we salk weakness in ads. here we saw a slowdown in the  cloud business. also i think some concerns about the capex spending, up 78% year  over year. is any of this a concern when we look to meta? >> yeah, in the alphabet  earnings there was some slowing. i think meta has an opportunity  and probably has capitalized on  this moment where advertisering  at the time that we started the  year were looking for more  efficient ad spend and they've  been able to deliver on that. some of your more traditional  brand type of spend, that's  pulled back. i think there's an opportunity  to capitalize that on the  quarter. we know they're going to be  spending a lot. we know they're going to be  spending a lot on ai. up until that point the market's been good, but the market, this  quarter in particular, in  thinking about alphabet,  microsoft, it's been a little  bit finicky when it comes to  that ai spend. so if there's misses and a lot  of spend going on, there could  be an issue. but overall i expect a positive  quarter for the company.  >> one last thing. we're going to play a sound bite later in our show. i'm going to paraphrase cramer. h said investors are starting to get religion. they get a little skittish when  it comes to high value names? >> definitely. they propelled some of these  further to the upside than they  should have been. and for this moment to really  work and the economy, big tech  in particular, you need to have  rational valuations. so the companies can operate  with consistency, so investors'  expectations are within the  realm of reason,","Category: Technology Stocks

What the latest Fed decision could mean for the markets and your money,2024-07-31 06:05:04-05:00,6,ptMcvjSvNLI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptMcvjSvNLI,"at t""the wall street journal,""  gunjan. good to have you both here. good morning.  >> good morning.  >> good morning.  >> some people are keeping their fingers crossed for a cut. expectations are for a september cut. what are you expecting  especially when it comes to that jay powell news conference? >> i think that i will signal a  cut is likely coming in  september, but what we should  not forget is we still have two  more cpi releases before  september 18th ftc meeting. yes, inflation has come down,  and that's been a significant  improvement in terms of when we  will begin to get cuts, but if  we have two more, i think the  signal today will be if  inflation continues to move  down, then we are likely to cut  interest rates in september.  >> gunjan, coming over to you,  your new piece. the general consensus is the  idea of a dovish fed is good. what are the fireworks that  people are expected? >> thanks, frank. i mean, we have seen a ton of  turbulence in the market  throughout the month. and traders are expecting us to  end things off with a bang. for example, pricing in the  stock options market are  indicating people are  positioning a 2% move after the  meeting. that's double the move we've  seen since 2010 according to  bank of america data. we're also seeing a similar  dynamic in the russell. what it shows you is there is a  lot of uncertainty around the  fed as torsten said. but how dovish will they be? that is really the big question. we've seen this kind of game of  chicken between the market and  the fed before, and it's going  to be interesting to see is this time durmt? does the fed actually live up to market expectations this time  around or do they kind of pour  cold water on some of the  excitement we've seen ahead of  this meeting? >> torsten, i want to point out  you project nod rate cuts and  now you're saying likely. you look at japan. they're looking to raise rates  while we're looking to cut. is that meaningful for japan or  here in the u.s.? >> i think that's very, very  important. two economies in the world. basically on the same day, one  is raising interest rates and  the other, it's cutting. this is an unusual environmental because central banks normally  move together. so that's probably also making  the fed slightly more hesitant  in terms of is it still a good  idea in particular with the  strength that we're still seeing that payrolls are still good,  retail, gdp in the second  quarter at 2.8 still very  strong. if you look at the daily data  for tsa and restaurant bookings  from open table and weaker data  across the board, the economy in the u.s. is still quite strong. it really is just inflation  that's coming down. so the trick for the fed would  be to communicate. yes, the economy is still good. we're having a slowdown but not  a crash at all. but inflation has come down and  that can justify why we begin to talk about rate cuts. to what you said earlier, we  were saying the economy is still strong and we still believe the  economy is strong. it's just that inflation has  come down and that's triggered  the fed to talk about rate cuts. >> so, again, you change your  forecast. no cuts. >>> gunjan, i want to come back  over to you. we've seen the russell move  higher. generally doesn't happen that  way. in your mind, what does that say about the small cap trade and  trader's confidence in the small cap trade? >> this is surely an incredibly  unusual dynamic. it's something we've seen with  things like memes stocks where  volatility rises as the stocks  or indexes goes up. what it shows you is there's  been a real lurch to the bullish trades tied to the russell. it's led to the violent  divergence of the russell, the  dow, the nasdaq, and the s&p  500. what pricing in the options  market shows you is people are  positioning for these swings to  continue around the fed today  and for a big swing after the  fed meeting. at least that's what pricing in  the stocks and market options  shows. some of that volatility has  coincided with volatility in the bond market. it's a really, really important  day for the bond market as well. in addition to the fed meeting,  we have the fetd's quarterly  announcement in just a few  hours. that could drive divergences and rotations we've seen throughout  the month as well.  >> torsten, i'm going to give  you the last word. there were was mers last month  maybe the fed waited too long. in your mind, the fed cut, has  it been too long? is there a sense maybe the fed  should just cut now? >> it's very clear the fed has  since december of last year  talked about rate cuts. that's why the market's  narrative for a very long period now has been rate cuts are  coming, rate cuts are coming. but to the economic data, it  happens to be moving along very  nicely. from that perspective if we get  down the roadover impulses to  inflation going up, for example, you've seen the j.o.l.t.s. datas with better than expected. we've seen across a number","Category: Macro

how does this work out for you? how many games do you get to go  see? >> i see a few of them. in the end, it has lots of  opportunities, our customers are here, but also it is an  opportunity for consumers around the world to participate and  come and enjoy the experience of the olympics. we use it across a whole set of  different fronts and also to  celebrate the local operations  in france, the torch relay,  which is now done and comes up  to the opening ceremony, there  is a fantastic opportunity to go through every village in france  and bring the olympics to some  places which don't see a lot of  things and have a moment of  celebration.  >> let's talk a little bit of  business here. we have been watching the  consumer, and depending who  you're listening to, sometimes  at the lower end of the consumer spectrum, sometimes the luxury  end, there has been a pullback. that's not something you all  have seen just yet. it seems like you're seeing  consumer spend strong, you  raised your guidance based on  what you're seeing. what is happening that gives you that kind of confidence? >> it is a tale two of cities,  no pun intended, we're here in  paris. you have the lower end consumer, particularly in the u.s., in  europe, under pressure from  purchasing power, reducing  occasions away from home, maybe  spending a little less, also the chinese economy is under  pressure, economically you're  seeing consumers pull back  there. on the other hand, there are  segments where people are  actually still spending and  spending strong, particularly on some of the premium beverages,  some of our value added dairy  beverages in the u.s. it is a combination of the two. and the benefit of companies, we have a big portfolio, such  geographic diversity, we're able to see our way through.  >> you've raised your pricing  pretty significantly. do you see any fatigue in terms  of what the consumer is willing  to accept from higher pricing? you saw north american case  volume down in the last quarter. >> for sure the consumer is  being more discerning in terms  of where they want to spend  their money. i think our strategy, something  i'm focused on, it is not just  about pasting on increases, it  is about earning the right of  taking up the pricing and  therefore you have to deliver  value for the consumer, the  marketing, innovation, the  packaging options they have,  where they're going to drink it. without that, the price  increases will inevitably erode  the volumes. got to earn the price increase  and make sure it can stick with  the consumers.  >> can i ask you a marketing  question? >> sure.  >> how much -- what is the  correlation between how much  money you spend on advertising  and this is a big event for you, and what you actually see on the other end in terms of sales? >> there is a lot of art and  science in marketing, as we all  know. we have been upping our  marketing pressure. it is not just the amount of  money you spend, but the quality of the advertising. this year we came out for the  first time ever, we won creative brand of the year at cannes. it is about the two, and really  you can spend as much as you  like, but if it is not good  advertising.  >> you have a better pulse than  most on what is actually  working. for example, does tv work for  you? is facebook, instagram better  than twitter, than tiktok? how do you see the different  platforms? >> i think there are two things  to bear in mind. one, are you trying to build a  brand image and do you need to  tell a story which needs more of a long form format are you  trying to do short form  performance marketing? >> people are not buying soda  off of direct to consumer way,  are they? >> they do. they can add it to the basket of whoever they use it from the  grocers. it may be about trying to  deliver a specific message. there is a difference in  relative pricing between the  different media channels and  that matters too. it is about the return on the  investment. so, what's consumers see and  what they do with it relates  with how much do i have to spend to get on there.  >> the ceo of mcdonald's is  going to join us later on in the show. mcdonald's has seen sale numbers drop, first time in four years  to see quarterly sales drop. you're a partner with them. they are getting praised by wall street right now, just in the  last couple of days, because it  looks like the value meals  they're doing are catching on  and bringing consumers back in. you partnered up with them on  that. how does that work? you kick in some cash to help  extend that $5 value meal deal? >> we have a huge long-standing  partnership with mcdonald's and  we have a partnership framework  on providing the beverages and  also joint marketing funds which are being used to drive this  activity and to bring consumers  back in to the restaurant. so really it is about that sweet spot of trying to increase  traffic or hold on to the  consumer base, or whatever your  franchise is, but also not ","Category: Other

Delta Air Lines CEO on CrowdStrike outage: Cost us half a billion dollars in five days,2024-07-31 07:26:06-05:00,7,j2DbePHiH64,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2DbePHiH64,"delta impacted by the longest of any major airline from the crowd air stri strike outage earlier this  month. it led to thousands of flight  cancellations. the outage occurred just as  these olympic games in paris  were about to start. delta the official airline of  team usa. and joining us right now for an  exclusive interview is the delta airlines ceo ed bastian here in  paris. i want to talk about -- i went  through jfk and flew on delta  and went to your amazing delta  lounge, which i know we have  been talking about for weeks now on the air. but let's start, though, with  the crowdstrike situation and  what happened. before we get there, what is the state of play right now, is  everything -- is everything back working? >> everything, except for joe's  ability to enter the app,  everything is working and we  have been up for over a week. over the last seven days, we had less than 100 consolatuldn't  cancellations in aggregate. we brought so much of the  production crews, the athletes  over, it was just a really,  really tough situation.  >> what is the lesson of it? not your fault, but clearly you  use microsoft, use crowdstrike. i wonder whether you have to  rethink about how these systems  are set up in the future.  >> absolutely. and it is funny because people  go out and wonder how this could happen, if we have redundancies, we built hundreds of millions of dollars in redundancies. the issue is what you said. microsoft and crowdstrike and we are heavy with both, by far, the heaviest in the industry with  both. we got hit the hardest in terms  of the recovery capability. people don't realize, microsoft  and crowdstrike are the top two  competitors around cyber with  each other. they don't necessarily partner  the same level that we need them to. so i think this is a call to the industry, everyone talks about  making sure big tech is  responsible, well, guys, this  cost us half a billion dollars  and that's --  >> what's going to happen? you're suing? >> we have no choice. over a period of five days,  between not just the lost  revenue, but the tens of  millions of dollars per day in  compensation and hotels and we  did everything we could to take  care of our customers over that  time frame, we have no -- so, if you're going to be having  access, access to the delta echo system in terms of technology,  you have to test the stuff, you  can't come into a mission  critical 24/7 operation and tell us we have a bug. it doesn't work. >> what did they offer you? did they say, oh, thanks, here's a meal voucher? >> do you really want to know? >> we really want know. >> i want go there. they haven't offered anything. free consulting advice to help  us. exactly. so we have to protect our  shareholders, our customers, our employees for the damage, not  just to the costs, but the  brand, the reputational damage  and the physical challenges.  >> does that mean using five  different companies in the  future for this? does that mean using one  company? >> it has been a wake-up call  for me. we have issues regularly in this space. and i think part of the issue,  to be honest with you guys, you  look at the crazy valuations, a  lot of these tech companies  trade at, multiples, double  digit multiples of future  revenues and so where is the  priority? is it growing the business? or delivering exceptional  service to their existing  customer base? i can tell you they have not  delivered exceptional service  and, by the way, it is not just  crowdstrike and microsoft. it is other names. >> microsoft is one of those  companies you also can't get  away from in some regards. is there any rethink about how  to use them or not? >> we have to. we have to. my sense is they're probably the most fragile platform within  that space. >> you think microsoft is --  >> when is the last time you  heard of a big outage at apple? >> right. >> very infrequent. the question is, is that in part because they don't have as much  corporate business? >> listen, they have our  business, we're primarily a  microsoft shop. i have tremendous respect for  microsoft. but they're building the future  and they have to make sure they  fortify the current. >> so, right now, is there,  like, a 45 or 60 or 100 day  plan? >> oh, yeah, we're in -- the  question you just raised, how do you rethink the fortification? we thought we had the best  between microsoft and  crowdstrike and they're  integrated, that's what caused a lot of the slowdown, to decouple them, to encrypt. we had 40,000 servers and we had to go touch and reset and it  dia didn't all come back on the way  they left. they're not scheduled. >> i'm sure you read the terms  of service on these agreements,  they have almost every out in  the world to suggest they are  not liable for anything unless  it is gross negligence, so the  question -- i'm not even sure -- i'm sure you probably signed  your life away on gross  negligence the way some of the  things are written. contractually, what do you think is going to happen? it is not just you who is going  after them. half a billion dollars would  wipe out a company like this.  >> we're not looking to wipe  them out, but we're looking to  make sure we get compensated  however they decide to for what  they cost us. half a billion dollars in five  days. >> let me ask you, one other  related question, we talked  about this delta one experience, which i had the opportunity to  go to, i was at jfk, it was  pretty cool. how expensive is that for you to do and how can you replicate  that around the world, is that  more important than what is on  the plane? how do you think about the  different dynamics here? >> the challenges in our  industry historically has been  seen as a commodity. as an industry broadly. over the last couple decades,  delta looked to differentiate  its people, its service, the  quality of what we deliver. the only way we can do that is  make sure we're leading with our front foot on premium and having a higher end opportunity for  people to buy up. our industry, you know, demand  is crazy. we never have seen demand at  this level. you see it, it is everywhere. but the lower end is having a  challenge. >> so much more price conscious. >> a lot more price conscious.  >> they're on kayak, they don't  care whether it is delta or --  >> that's how value used to ","Category: Other

n inflammation. we're learning more and more  about it and how it is connected to so many different diseases. that's where you see it as a --  >> you're well informed. it is a very specific targeted  mechanism. so that's why it is such an  incredible safety profile. it is transformational. it is one of the things that  driving the turn around in the  organization. we're really modernizing q2  results, up 10%, we were ahead  on eps, we're really making a  huge amount of progress on the  pipeline. and everybody is feeling very  good. we decided by the way back in  2021 to sponsor the olympics  here in paris. because we felt the timing with  the transformation, the  celebration, engagement, the  commitment to health and global  wellness would be perfect for  us. it turned out to be exactly  that.  >> paul, you had something, i  think it was in stat news  yesterday, a piece you wrote  where you talked about  competitiveness here in europe. you called it a crisis of  competitiveness. pointed out that it used to be  25 years ago, one out of every  two drugs was discovered here in europe. now it is one in six. what happened, how do you fix  it? >> well, look, there is no  debating how good the  universities are and the  research is and the basic  science and the publications. but there is a huge amount of  work to do to make sure those  drugs that are discovered in  countries like france, uk,  germany, et cetera, are  available for patients in the  end. and only one in two drugs  approved in europe are available for patients in europe. so, i'm trying to crusade a  little for the attention to the  fact that there is brilliant  innovation that patients can  benefit from, and we play a part too in being responsible in how  we bring the drugs forward. but there is so much innovation  on tap. if europe leaves it too long,  the gap -- the u.s. powers  ahead. we need to be careful.  >> is it a regulatory problem,  research and investment problem? where does it come down? >> it is not a research and  investment problem. the regulators have seen the  merits on improving the  medicines and do that tat a  european level. they have budget pressures,  different things to consider. often it is sort of  deprioritized. hard to imagine, but it is true. in france, we make great  progress with the french  government to make innovation. we launched vaccine for rsv, the french government, one of the  earliest adopters in the world,  not just in europe. in general, in europe, it is  falling behind and so it is  bringing innovation forward. we're one of the biggest  research-based pharma companies  in europe and i feel a sense of  responsibility to try and bring  that to people's attention. >> if you ask investors to be  patient, when was that you were  on? >> last year.  >> was that last year? >> yeah. there is going it to be some  spending before you -- stock is  near a high. they were well rewarded. do you feel like you past that? >> i remember coming on, the day where we decided to double down  on science. the street took a little while  to understand it. >> the stock fell off a cliff, i think and has come back up.  >> you're trying to do the right thing. we're a development-driven  tech-powered company, committed  to patients, and driving growth. and we're in that transformation period. we have one of the best growth  profiles in all of big pharma.  >> never nervous? >> i think if you do the right  thing, you can imagine to sleep  at night. i was pretty confident. but i'm glad to see that we're  moving in the right direction  and frankly it is being --  >> we have to run, but i do need to ask you what your plans are  with your consumer health  business at this point? will you sell it, spin it off,  do you know? >> we know it wants to be on its own. we know it consider create more  value for everybody there for  doing that. we said that we'll be ready to  let it go as early as q4 2024. we're runn","Category: Other

McDonald's CEO on state of the consumer: Seeing category slowdown from almost every major market,2024-07-31 09:15:09-05:00,7,JABEZljjbNA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JABEZljjbNA,"the best reads in the world when it comes to state of the  consumer and inflation. we welcome chris kempczinski. mcdonald's president and ceo. thank you very much for being  with us those.  >> glad to be here.  >> talking about mcdonald's a  lot since in paris both on-air  and off because you're right  across the street from our total too. been by it several times. before we get into what's  happening here in paris you're  out with your earnings this week and gave a good feel what's  going on around the globe. maybe talk a little about that. big questions what's happening  with the consumer everywhere  around the globe. luxury spending coming down and  the other end of the spectrum  people pulling back and not  spending as much either. where do you really see what's  happening? what would you say about the  state of the consumer? >> we started mooring on it  really last year and what we  were seeing was a low-income  consumer that -- that that  consumer was being much more  price discriminating, and this  year, as it's unfolded deepened  and broadened. started in the u.s. seeing it in more markets. a consequence of that, a lot of  consumer companies caution  what's happening with the  consumer right now. i think there is sort of this  broad-based slowdown. it probably is more pronounced  with lower-income consumer, but  even upper income seeing for  example things like frequency to restaurants increasing.  >> you rolled out a value menu. this $5 menu this summer and  it's pretty successful. in fact, your stock up over the  last couple sessions even thoug  though earnings were below  expectations i think because you talked about extending that. what are you doing with that,  and how long will you extend it? >> i would consider the $5 menu  sort of chapter one of a  multi-chapter value playbook  that we're going to be writing,  and that is continued through  the end of august. we're working with the  franchisees in the u.s. to get a broader value construct in  place. if you think about what's  happened for us, and you go back to where we were in 2019, our  costs in the u.s. have gone up  40% in our restaurants --  >> since '19? >> since 2019. costs are up 40%. >> wow. >> prices are -- and prices are  up. >> pricing is up  correspondingly. and so, what you now have is you have to have a value reset  where, you know, what we had  before was a 1, 2, 3 menu. that's a little less compelling  when your prices have had to go  up 40%. what we're working on with the  franchisees is what's next. i would consider the $5 meal a  bridge value program and then  what we'll be doing is putting  in place a more permanent value  program, much like we had  previously. >> that's a really tough thing  to tackle, especially when you  look at california where minimum wage was up, like, 25% earlier  this year, starting in, what,  march? how do you combat that? how do you offer value when  you've got prices up like that? >> i think what happened in  california, i hope, is a unique  situation. it was a piece of, you know,  very lopsided legislation that  was targeting one industry, our  industry, and actually targeting only one segment of the  industry, which was large  companies. smaller restaurants were  exempted from all of that. and so, you did see there was a  big move on minimum wage. we have had to do everything in  the playbook, basically, in  california from finding  productivity opportunities in  the restaurants, looking at  staffing, looking at hours, and  then yes, you do have to look at pricing, so when you're a  franchisee, these businesses are all locally owned. i think that gets forgotten. these are locally owned  businesses and pricing had to be part of the equation in  california, and you're seeing in california the business there is falling off to a greater degree  than what you're seeing in other markets arnold the u.s. >> you have had another head  wind you've been battling and  that is a muslim boycott because of what an israeli franchisee  did with october 7th. it's been an issue here in  france. >> i wouldn't characterize it as something that was related to  the act of a single franchisee. i think you're seeing broadly  western brands have been a  target for some of what's  happened after the outbreak of  the war in middle east. this is a terrible situation  that's going on over there, and  it is impacting our business in  some markets. again, i would say the thing to  remember is, in these markets  where we're having some of those boycotts, these are businesses  that are owned by local  franchisees. we typically are the largest  employer in that market, and  most of our supply chain is  sourced from in that market, so  here in france, for example,  three-quarters of our supply  chain is sourced from within the country. we have 28,000 farmers in france who supply our restaurants, so i think we, like a lot of western  brands, are sort of working our  way through this. the important point is, you  know, mcdonald's is not taking a side on this. and i think for us, we're about  supporting communities, and  that's what we're going to  continue to do. >> is there another restaurant  chain you look at that you think is doing it better? starbucks is struggling in  similar ways. >> you know, i honestly don't  spend a lot of time comparing  what others are doing. i think for us, it's -- it's  going back to the foundation for us, which is to go back into the community and to lean on our  local franchisees, to lean on  those local connections and make sure we're telling our story  because i think sometimes  there's this idea that  mcdonald's is this big global  behemoth, but at the end of the  day, we're rea","Category: Other

AMD CEO Lisa Su on Q2 earnings beat: Very excited about the traction that we're seeing,2024-07-31 09:17:56-05:00,7,FqASty3KcqQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqASty3KcqQ,"short period of time. >> you're doing that,  mrs. lincoln, how was the play  stuff. >> let's get to lisa su. >> amd reporting a super strong  quarter. sending shares much higher. of course, when it was first  announced, the stock was  actually down. a lot of this is around a.i.  adoption. we're going to have pc. ceo lisa su joins us now first  on cnbc to discuss the quarter. lisa, great to see you. >> good morning, great to see  you guys. >> oerkkay, lisa, on page five   your conference call, you said  something that i think was  jaw-dropping. you said, ""as a result, we are  now expect datacenter gpu --""  david, that's important. "" -- revenue to exceed  $4.5 billion, up from $4 billion that you guided in april."" you just guided up $500 million  in one quarter? >> well, first of all, we had a  very strong second quarter, very excited about the traction that  we're seeing. it is all about a.i. you know, i know you guys were  talking about a.i. in the  earlier segment. there's no question that a.i. is like the biggest technology  advance over the last 50 years,  and we're very excited to be  helping power that foundation. so, yes, we were able to -- had  a very strong datacenter  quarter. you know, we more than doubled  our datacenter revenue in the  second quarter, and we see  strong growth into the second  half of the year, so part of  that is, you know, acceleration  in our a.i. growth, and that's  what allowed us to increase our  guidance from greater than  $4 billion, you know, 90 days  ago to greater than $4.5 billion for the year. >> extraordinary guide up. one of the things that has  bothered people ever since the  alphabet call was the notion of, we better build it because they  might come, and if not, we're  going to fall behind. when i listen to your call and  to you, i feel it's the  opposite. i think customers are desperate  for compute power, whether it be from you or nvidia. they've got to have it. you're taking share when it  comes to some parts. is it not true that the real  issue is, can you meet demand? >> it is absolutely true that  compute is really the foundation for what unlocks all of this,  you know, a.i. capability. it is true that the supply chain is very tight right now, and  frankly, people need more  compute. we're in a very, very strong  position in the sense that we're continuing to ramp up our  mi-300, which is our a.i.  compute chip, but we also see,  actually, you know, broader  demand trends that say, even in  traditional compute that had  taken, you know, a little bit of a slower start for the year has  actually n seen some very  positive signals, so we see that on the traditional datacenter  cpu side as well. overall, when i talk to ceos and cios across the enterprise, i  think this is an opportunity to  invest. it's an opportunity to invest,  to really capture all of the  capability of a.i., and it's  also an opportunity to refresh  datacenters that have been aging for some time. so, these are some of the trends that we're excited about going  into the second half. >> so, lisa, maybe because  you're a plain spoken person  like my friend, david faber,  both from queens, i might add,  can you please explain to people that even though a.i. is not  necessarily curing cancer or  putting a man on jupiter right  now, it is integral to many of  the organizations that you deal  with and talk to every day? >> absolutely. first of all, great to see david and carl as well. when i look at a.i., i really  look at a.i. as trying to really help every enterprise, you know, every company, every sector  really become more productive. and we see it in many different  ways. from simple things, you know,  you'll hear people talk about  call centers and customer  response, and i call those very  low-hanging fruit. to much more complex things like designing better chips. that's something that we do in  our semiconductor peers do or  designing better factories or  actually even helping discover  the next big drug discoveries  and the health care things that  you mentioned. i do think this is a long-term  arc, so people are always  expecting things to happen  overnight. this won't happen overnight, but the time to invest is now so  that we see the payoff in the  one, two, three, four, five-year time frame and that's what  companies are doing because we  see the huge potential for using a.i. in all of our businesses. >> lisa, it is david. back to the m-1300 and the guide to $4.5 billion that i think is  being embraced by investors. i've had a couple ask why it  isn't higher if you annualize  the quarter and add in a growth  rate, it would get you oozas hi  as $5 billion. are you being conservative? >> the way we look at these  things is we call it like it is  today, and what we see is it was very important when we started  the year to pass some important  customer milestones. we have some great partnerships  out there. we've talked about microsoft  being a very strong partner for  us across the datacenter and  especially in a.i. we've talked about meta, oracle, we've talked about a lot of the  oem partners as well that have  adopted mi-300 and we wanted to  go through some of the key  milestones so the fact that  we sitting here at the middle of  the year and calling  $4.5 billion for the full year  is a great place to be, thinking about where we are on this  trajectory, and we'll continue  to call it like it is as we see  every quarter. >> this came up. something about a high-bandwidth memory problem that had you  losing some yield. it was not you, it was related  to a supplier. was that an issue that has been  resolved? >> you know, david, i would say  that there's a lot of noise in  the system, and i would really  not pay attention to those kinds of things. are these extremely complex  products. mi-300 is over 150 billion  transistors. of course we're always working  things realtime, but as far as,  you know, we look at this, this  is a very, very successful  production ramp. we're very excited. we're seeing mi-300 in our  customers, datacenters, in  volume, running production  traffic, giving gr","Category: Technology Stocks

>> i think the nba is super  thorough in how they do their  work. been very impressed with  everything that adam silver has  organizeds, we're excited about  our world. we'll stay tuned, but i'm pretty confident that we'll have our  package moving along here and a  year from now wish it was a year sooner. that the games, just have the  to -- the usa basketball game  had a rating almost kequivalent  with nba finals.  >> tonight's game might be one  of our rating winners.  >> a little payback for that  scare.  >> what do you do while here? do you get to get out and see  the games yet? is this more about business and  checking in to see what things  are doing? >> a little all of the above. spent a little time with the  international olympic committee, u.s. olympic committee getting  ready for the l.a. games. a good amount of business but  have had some fun. i got sto see the women's  gymnastics. great night for the u.s. seeing the national flag go up. a big memory. beach volleyball. one of the theft in sports,  electricity and nadal djokovic. hopefully not his last, but  maybe.  >> mike's having too much fun.  >> i'm having a lot of fun.  >> you, brian? >> my family's coming over in a  few days and go out then and see a lot of sporting events. i came over several times  before, and, again, i just can't say enough wonderful things  about our team has said, no  country has ever been quite as  organized as flansrance has beed paris and president macron. the operation is running  smoothly. got a long way to go and i can't wait to be a part of it.  >> we wish everything was --  thinking about sports and the  nba and how excited i am to -- i wasn't before. betting, and i always say. you hear me talking about it,  but i watch all the nba games  now because i have a stake. it's going to go state to state  eventually. everybody's going to have it and maybe i'll bet on rumpy? sports is so incredibly  valuable. especially when you have $5 on  the game, what you're seeing  with peacock having every  sporting event there, and you're in control of your -- or sit  back on nbc and just have the  traditional broadcasts. we're trying to appeal to every  demographic, every taste. that's only going to get better  and better. t technology makes it so seamless. this was a milestone moment for  our company and i'm so glad we  dpliverred. the playoff game with kansas  city. largest screened event in  history. that's what this is, now  becoming, and so what imagines  in the future. whether it's betting or whether  it's camera angles or higher def quality or more choices, we want to be the company to bring you  that.  >> do you want to buy something? are you jonesing to do anything  like that? >> whoa. no, i'm not. i said this on the earnings  call. we have the making of a great  company. so we'd rather invest in  something purely positive, such  as the nba. big investment. we think we have a great  partnership in the making. we're excited about where  they're taking the sport.  all of the other things out  there. there's good and some negatives, and this is just good. so i think that's the trajectory we hope to stay on.  >> you just emphasized that. we have strong businesses across the board. each of our businesses is in its own strong position making  money. there's no piece of our business we wouldsy we're a laggard in,  and we -- push our teams to say, where can we grow? where should we invest? and we put a tremendous amount  of money back into our own  business. add a million passings in the  cable business. more footprint growth. driving the business services  business. driving the wireless business. so on the cable side of the  business, and at nbc, you know,  christopher nolan coming over to our studio thanks to the great  work by the team there, it's a  way to grow. it's got a great director and lo and behold you end up with a  pile of oscars. going after the nba. they'll be more, and then  putting, you know, quite a few  billions of dollars into epic  universe in florida. that's the better -- that and  returning capital to the our  shareholders has been a good  formula for us and it starts  with having great businesses you can make better and invest in  organically. we look around at the chess  board everyone wants to ask  about, inheriting a lot of other people's problems is, it's a  tough way to do it versus just  go build around the great assets we already have.  >> go to ask about those  problems, though. do you expect more -- maybe we  here at cnbc here, do you expect a lot more consolidation or do  you think actually the  regulatory environment there  won't be. by the way, maybe some of these  companies continue to have  problems and maybe an  opportunity in the future? >> you can't control those kind  of things. so what you do is what mike just said very articulately, play  your own game. and we just saw with paramount,  a new, somebody came in and  said, we think there is a better way. so we wish them well. david ellison, met him once or  twice. smart, capable people. maybe consolidation say you hope there's consolidation, but on  the other hand, new energy, new  thinking. that's also good. we can't control any of that. what we can do is try to build a company with growth tracks and  several businesses in  transition, have the strongest  balance sheet, turn capital to  shareholders and be consistent. i would say pick a word that has defined us for a long time it's  kind of ""be consistent and  patient."" try to build a very, very  special and unique company. it all comes together in a  moment like this, a chance to  celebrate.  >> our viewers will be watching  jay powell later today, and his  decision on interest rates. i know fundamentally you guys  are just playing your own game  and doing those things, but what do you look at, with the  interest environment and what it might mean? >> it's more what's happening  with the consumer. a little softness in parks. other companieses results, maybe a little -- finding the right  balance between getting  inflation under control and  keeping the economy going. i think the fed's done a good  job, personally. i think we're getting closer to  the time where we'll likely see  some moves.  >> if the regulatory hurdles  were gone, something changes. i don't know what. and you could do whatever you  wanted. there's nothing you would do? >> right this minute, that  hasn't impeded our --  >> that's not what it is. you're right. i think about the mergers and  first two years, paying down  debt trying to somehow -- you  know, hope that eventually it's  going to pay off. but there's no guarantee","Category: Other

Former Fed governor on FOMC meeting: Labor market will determine how fast the Fed will cut,2024-07-31 10:58:40-05:00,4,KjEBq3WXGys,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjEBq3WXGys,"than alphabet when is this  paying off narrative? same thing but slightly  different spin on it. >> yeah.  >> you can see the investors are reacting. >> great point.  >> amd helps a lot. >> there are choices right now. thanks. bob pisani. to bob's point, a decision from  policy makers this had  afternoon. our next guest does expect two  cuts this year, beginning in  september, joining us this  morning, former chairman larry  meyer. the last few days we have had  former fed officials argue that  july should be live. you're not quite there? >> no. this is not decision day. we call the meeting dels  decision day this is not a a  decision day. this is a day to watch the  statement and the press  conference. and the objective is setting the stage, not starting. setting the stage. and reinforcing market  expectations which expect a  september cut.  >> what kind of pros will  convince you that is exactly  what the fed chair is trying to  do? >> what they're talking about  are progress. progress on inflation. additional confidence. the orders that suggest they're  ready to go. in addition they'll be talking  about the dual mandate, the  balance of risk because they're  not only worried about  inflation, but they're worried  about an unwanted cooling in the labor market. the labor market is fine right  now but that's where the balance of risks are. and the labor market will  determine how fast the fed cuts. >> larry we waited a long time  to see the lags from the higher  interest rates. what are the lags looking like  when the fed starts cutting? >> i think they're the same. you know, it's a -- a year --  >> in other words, how will they know how many times they need to cut to preserve this soft  landing? >> you don't know. what they -- what they think now is given their forecast, they  think they have to move towards  a neutral rate which consists of being at and staying at maximum  employment and price stability. that's what the models tell you  the judgmental forecast and  you're responding to the data. the data is telling you you're  right about inflation and you're right the labor market is  cooling. so everything is consistent with their expectations. >> so what should they set the  stage for beyond a september cut at this point? especially when there's a debate as to what neutral looks like  and when they're going to be  able to get there.  >> right. so first of all, they're not  setting the stage but saying  something that everybody should  and will interpret that this is  not a mid course correction. it's the beginning of ongoing  easing cycle and they're  searching for neutral and don't  know where neutral is. call it 3 to 4%. to the extent it's 4%, that  means slower. to the extent it's 3%, that  means somewhat faster and that  means you have to be more  cautious. you want to get to 4% by the end of next year, i'd say, and then  you want to be a little more  cautious because you might be  where you are. look at the data, look at ","Category: Macro

The Senate Budget Committee holds a hearing to examine the future of EVs — 7/31/2024,2024-07-31 11:24:29-05:00,125,rYiLZcE5MOg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYiLZcE5MOg,"grassley we're going to begin with opening remarks by myself and then ranking member grassley and then uh senator graham at whose request uh this hearing is uh taking place so let me start by thanking senator graham and his staff for their partnership on today's hearing and thank ranking member grassley for his blessing of this effort today's bipartisan hearing looks at transitioning away from fossil fuels in my view an econ iic national security and climate imperative in a way that effectively seizes opportunities and addresses challenges the auto industry is a major economic engine as senator stabenau who is here will be the first to argue in 2023 the global auto market was valued at $4 trillion of which the us accounted for a bit less than 177% two us automakers ford and gm are among the world's five largest automakers foreign companies operate assembly plants in the us senator graham is uh attentive to the bmw plant that operates in his home state whenever we go do the munich security conference you sure to check in with the bmw folks to make sure they keep building in south carolina motor vehicles and parts were america's second largest export and the auto market could increased over $6 trillion by 2031 so we want to be a part of that action to grow us auto workers share of this growing pi we need to understand and respond to this global market so here's where we are globally 20% of vehicles sold in 2023 around the world were electric 20% in china which is the world's largest auto market 33% of cars were electric in europe 20% of vehicles sold were electric and other major markets are racing to evs between 2022 in 2023 electric car sales tripled in brazil and more than quadrupled in thailand and i' put into the record a uh article um from the new york times which i've just now misplaced but um that points out how the thai auto market has been lost to japanese manufacturing which used to control it because they aren't uh producing the electric vehicles that the thai market uh demands so you got to have the vehicles people want to meet the market uh here it is thank you with without objection i will add that to the record the writing is on the wall for us around the world the future of personal transportation is electric completely independent of whatever the united states decides to do and that's great first it means more freedom from a global commodity whose price is manipulated by international pro dictators over and over american consumers suffer as the geopolitical designs of petro dictators cause oil prices to sar real energy independence comes from independence from fossil fuel cartels going electric benefits western democracies as oil and gas revenues fund many of our worst foreign adversaries look no further than the corrupt p tyrant vladimir putin as we reduce our dependence on oil and gas we diminish our foreign adversaries ability to bully and corrupt senator graem and i wrote in a 2021 oped published in time magazine if you could wave a magic wand and transition the world away from fossil fuels americans would instantly be safer and without objection i ask that that be made a part of the record as the driver and owner of two chevy bolts i'll also add they're just better cars they're quieter faster and more fun to drive they don't have tailpipe emissions stinking up highways and neighborhoods repair and maintenance costs are nearly non-existent no oil changes one tenth the number of parts to break or fail no expensive dangerous smelly gasoline in emergencies ev fleets can even provide backup power to families when the grid goes down and smart ev chargers can help shave dangerous load peaks for electric utilities if we make the needed small investments in the required infrastructure and of course yes electric vehicles dramatically reduce carbon pollution in the transportation sector currently the largest source of fossil fuel emissions in the us the more we reduce carbon pollution the better our chances of avoiding the dire systemic climate related economic risks we've discussed in this committee over the last 18 months it may be too late to save florida's property insurance market but there are plenty of other risks we'd be wise to avoid and fools to stumble into electrifying the transportation sector presents a tremendous economic opportunity automakers get the message that people want evs and they are responding since 2017 they have along with their battery partners invested $125 billion dollar in electrification 20 states have or will have ev production or assembly of battery facilities for some reason tesla is taking a hit but other makers are seeing surging sales year-over-year ford ev sales increased 86% from the first quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024 rivan sales jumped 59% over the same period so how do we position our auto industry and our nation for that that economic opportunity and for global competitiveness as our economy electrifies it needs to be supported by a 21st not a 20th century grid the grid will need to handle increased demand from electric vehicles from heating and cooling from manufacturing from hydrogen electrolizing and from energy gobbling data centers to meet this demand with clean power requires new and upgraded transmission to deliver that power to consumers that means smart reforms to our cumbers and an equated permitting process domestic supply chain investments must accelerate look at china 15 years ago china saw the value of electric vehicles and batteries and began investing and now it dominates critical mineral and battery manufacturing markets let's learn the servitude lessons from our fossil fuel dependence and from our lost manufacturing capacity let's swiftly counter this emerging geopolitical risk with smart investment and take back our e economic dominance in clean energy products we must also find a way to reconcile the surging ev market with the highway trust fund that provides 80% of federal highway spending with a majority of its revenue from federal gas taxes the bipartisan infrastructure law which most recently replenished the fund sunsets in just two years the clock is ticking on highway infrastructure funding to my mind this is a morning in america moment freedom from dependence on pro dictators opportunity to reclaim from china clean energy leadership better safer products for american consumers with more money in their pockets cleaner air to breathe along highways and neighborhood streets and an important step forward on our pathway to climate safety what's not to love if we do this right thank you again to senator grahe for this hearing i look forward to the conversation and i turn now to senator grassley followed by senator graham for opening statements thank you mr chairman welcome to our expert witnesses our last hearing was with cbo director swagel uh he was uh welcome a very welcoming event at this committee and unfortunately a rare opportunity for this committee to focus on critical uh broken budget process uh it gives us a chance to talk to somebody that knows that that process needs to be fixed and a primary responsibility of this committee in exchanged for holding a cbo hearing at my request i agreed to senator graham working with chairman white house to put together today's hearing we'll be discussing electric vehicles uh and barriers to the electrification of america's light duty fleet uh the biden harris administration's unattainable goal of 50% new ev sales by 2030 has been on full display over the last four years from the imposing expensive epa regulations to doing uh uh doling out billions in ev subsidies for the rich the economic detriment to the uh ev policy to america's ev policy is quite evident now i don't want to give the wrong impression ev technology is impressive and works well for some but i ones know that there are four more challenges to ev adoption that many care to admit evs best serve wealthier people who also live in or near suburban and urban areas perhaps the most prominent barrier to ev adoption is that v evs are uneconomical cbo's february baseline set the record straight telling us that the so-called inflation reduction acts ev handout would increase the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars i also couldn't help but notice that the price of evs rose immediately after the ira's passage to absorb the bills $7500 new ev tax credit these ev costs were then of course passed on to the consumer of course now many had to be discounted because they haven't been able to sell them and i've yet to hear a comprehensive plan to make ev owners pay in into federal highway trust fund ev drivers are currently free riding on the backs of the middle class and although some states have instituted an extra fee for so-called fuele efficient vehicles making them even more expensive there are many holes in the rapid ev transition fantasy they include a lack of critical minerals needed to produce evs lack of transmission infrastructure needed to support their increased electricity demands and our current reliance upon nefarious countries in the v ev supply chain according to the university of michigan the world would need to mine 115% more copper from 2018 to 2015 that has been mined in all of human history up until 2018 just to do business as usual this copper mining doesn't even include the green transition and the ev they take three to five times as much copper as a standard vehicle i hope we discuss where these critical minals from the so-called ev trans transition will come from china dominates the global critical mineral supply chain accounting for approximately 60% of the worldwide production and 85% of processing capacity and we struggle to permit federal projects here in america from wind turbines to transmission lines to pipelines to hard rock mines left-wing environmentalists are holding up the permitting reform needed for the very ev expansion that they claim the left claims climate crisis but backs away from comprehensive reform when the environmental lobby comes calling they also claim to care about air quality and environmental justice but ignore the unreported and under reported particulate emissions from tires under the heavy weight of evs legislators must do better and i hope this hearing serves as a stepping stone for honest permitting of dialogue moving forward as we grapple with environmental red tape the chinese are rapidly expanding coal power plants to fuel ev manufacturing boom i'd like to welcome all today's witnesses invited here by senator white house and graham and finally mr chairman i request your unanimous consent to put this article called copper can't be mined fast enough to electrify vehicles i thank you i i before uh you go on i was thinking i mentioned a few inconsistencies in my open remarks but i think of of others and maybe it's being the adjective unrealistic or inconsistency may fit a couple things but iowa is the number one producer of ethanol we have 43,000 jobs in iowa and if we had every vehicle uh in the united states be uh uh evs uh you could see what that could do to the particular job that we created 40 years ago to produce a more environmentally friendly product than uh than petroleum is we have the inconsistency of uh the rainforest being uh hacked away to mine nickel in indonesia we have the inconsistency of people in the congress that talk about we got to stop the use of child labor around the globe and yet we have children mining cobalt in congo i mentioned transmission in my opening comment the chairman mentioned transmission but this permitting process is holded by environmentalists uh not wanting to cut red tape here in washington dc and then you have the silly uh posture of the uh uh in inflation reduction act a point uh appropriating billions of dollars for uh for uh charging stations and i guess to dat we have about eight so i i just think there's a lot about this whole process that hasn't been thought out very well i'm done now well i hope that the 125 billion in private capital that has been dedicated to this as otherwise senator graham merchant heill economic policy of the federal government well thank you good morning good morning what have i learned we have donuts at the budget committee and i'm going to take a wild guess senator grassley did not buy them but he's welcome to as many of them as he wants uh sen grassley you laid out real challenges and everything you said is real so what i want to do is thank the chairman for having this uh committee hearing about electric vehicles because i'm in a very heavy car manufacturing state and they're making electric cars and hybrid cars and all kind of cars and i'm trying to figure out sort of like where should we what should we be doing and when should we do it as a nation i met with a chinese ambassador yesterday i talked to him in a very long time i'm going go to china next year they decided 15 years ago to get in this business for some reason it seems to be like they were pretty smart a lot of people are buying electric cars um president trump says let them buy electric cars do away with the mandate you it makes some sense to me the world seems to be making more electric cars and using electric cars and what does that mean for us well if you really want to compete in this space senator grassley laid out some real challenges power let's say half the cars on the road at some point in time become electric the grid demand will go through the roof how can you generate enough power um to accommodate electric vehicles and where does it come from can you do it with all renewables and how do you do it without natural gas you can't so to my friends uh in the environmental world we need to be thinking about increased power production that can actually occur that means regulatory reform and everything senator white house just mentioned but nuclear power evs as projected will take up all the power produced by the nuclear industry and certain renewables just by themselves these data centers you know you're bless to have them but you're cursed too because they're just power consumers so it seems the digital economy and electric vehicles is going to increase demand for power in a way nobody's really thought through and where does the new power come from how do you get it online how you get it delivered is something i think worthy of the congress's consideration not just this committee so chairman white el thank you very much for having this the um demand seems to be real apart from the mandate so what happens to the highway trust fund 5 billion in loss revenue uh if the numbers projected come true uh in the united states so as senator grassley indicated if you're driving an electric vehicle we got to find some way for you to pay into maintaining the roads i don't know what the right answer answer is but we better come up with it pretty quick you know we aim and shoot first and aim later is sort of what we're doing here we're setting a goal to have 50% of all the cars in america become electric but we haven't really thought through how you improve the grid to get there uh where does a revenue come from that will be lost and china to my colleagues we're in competition with china in many areas they dominate this market do we really want to replace dependence on mid east oil and gas with china dominance of the supply chain in electric vehicles the processing facilities to make a battery really don't exist here how do you create them and as senator grassly indicated where are the resources necessary to make battery come from if we could make a battery out of corn that'd be good uh i don't think we can but i'm willing to have an open mind about that so the bottom line is this is coming whether we like it or not and i think there's an upside to it to be honest with you and there's definitely a downside so from a national point of view it seems to me that we've set a goal and we have not put the infrastructure in place to meet that goal and from a republican point of view if you said there is no more mandate i'd be curious to see what kind of sales would occur without a mandate it wouldn't go to zero over the arc of time they're going to be more electric vehicles not less in the united states and over the arc of time there going to be a lot of chinese electric cars all over the world i'd like to compete in this space forget about the mandate for a moment consumers particularly younger people are into this and the world is into this this america needs to play in this space for a variety of reasons whether it's clean air whether it's just creating jobs for the new economy whatever reason we need to think long and hard about how we compete the challenges we face and we're behind in a game that's being played by china very aggressively and when it comes to america's national security interest i think we need to compete in the transportation space so thank you for having the hearing i don't know what the answers are to all these questions but i do know that the march toward electric vehicles is inevitable thank you senator graham uh we have five witnesses here uh today who've been agreed on each a bipartisan selection the first is dr jesse jenkins assistant professor at princeton university with a joint appointment in the department of mechanical and aerospace engineering and the ander center for energy and environment dr jenkins also leads princeton's zeroc carbon energy systems research and optimization laboratory which conducts modeling to evaluate lowc carbon energy technologies and generate insights to improve energy and climate planning our second witness is brda gross director of transportation at epri formerly the electric power research institute in her role miss gross is responsible for defining the market strategies needed to accelerate the electrification of the transportation system with a focus on identifying the gaps that need to be addressed to achieve 2030 climate goals she was formerly the director of advanced vehicle commercialization at general motors so i hope she was smiling when we talked about bolts third is morin henman the co-founder and executive chair of silverado policy accelerator prior to founding silverado miss hinman served as director for environment and natural resources at the office of the united states trade representative she also served as the u at the us department of commerce as senior industry trade specialist responsible for international policy development and inter agency advocacy for the us environmental technology silverado is helping this committee in a number of areas and i'm grateful to miss hman for being here our next witness is david schweer the chief policy officer at the alliance for automotive innov ation before joining the alliance david scher was the interim president and ceo of the alliance for automobile manufacturers prior to joining the auto alliance in 2015 mr scher worked in the us senate for over 15 years holding various positions including staff director of the committee on commerce science and transportation welcome back mr schweer and last but not least we have jeff davis a senior fellow at the ino center of transportation mr davis joined ino in 2015 from his own transportation and public works research and consulting company he started his career working in the house of representative so also welcome back uh to you uh mr davis thank you all for joining us today dr jenkins please proceed you have five minutes for an oral statement and your testimony like that of all the others will be put into the record completely graham for organizing the hearing and the opportunity to testify my name thank you uh thank the chairman the ranking member and senator graham for the opportunity to testify and for organizing the commit the hearing today i'm jesse jenkins a professor of energy systems engineering at princeton university i also lead the repeat project which assesses the impacts of federal energy and climate policy but i have to note that all views expressed today are my own the united states is now in the early stages of a momentous transition in the automotive sector over 1.1 million battery electric vehicles were delivered to us consumers in 202 3 alongside over 183,000 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles so by the end of 2023 almost one in 10 light duty vehicles sold in the us had a plug this transition to electric vehicles is a central pillar in the united states efforts to both cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce our vulnerability to shocks in global oil markets today the united states is producing more oil than any country at any point in history and yet the us economy remains dangerously exposed to the vola of global oil prices the decisions of a dictator to invade a neighbor or a disaster on the other side of the world can send the cost of filling the tank in denver or de moine soaring and every $10 per barrel increase in the price of oil is a $210 million per day tax on american consumers and businesses so we simply cannot drill our way to energy security but we can electrify by severing our reliance on gasoline and diesel to fuel our cars and trucks we can finally secure america's independ dependence from global oil shocks electrifying transportation is also critical to meet national climate objectives switching to evs and cleaning up our grid is the critical onew punch that will decarbonize transportation president biden established a goal to cut us greenhouse gas emissions to half of our peak levels by 2030 to reach this goal electric vehicle sales should make up about half of all light duty vehicle sales by that date that's up about five-fold from today's share yet over the last nine months sales of plug-in vehicles in the united states have plateaued driving a growing gap between current trends and our us climate targets electric vehicle sales growth actually accelerated through the third quarter of 2023 regularly exhibiting explosive year- on-year growth rates of roughly 40 to 60% but beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023 growth in us ev sales has stalled a trend that's continued through the first half of this year at the current pace sales of plug-in vehicles are up just 9% this year if we look beyond the topline numbers it's clear that the story so far is mostly about tesla over the first half of 2024 tesla's sales contracted by 13% while sales of all other plug-in hybrid vehicles and plugin and electric vehicles are up a healthy 31% that's right in line with the repeat projects expectations for this year for the sector as a whole taking a step back consumer surveys find that about half of us vehicle buyers are considering buying an ev within the next 12 months indicating substantial consumer interest and potential for for large market growth cost and charging related concerns remain the most commonly cited barriers to consumer adoption but both trends are improving thanks to both market competition and private investment as well as supportive public policy millions of new evs do mean much more demand for electricity raising the question is the us grid prepared first it's important to note that given the dynamics of the fleet turnover even if 100% of new vehicle sales were electrified tomorrow it would still take about f 15 years before the entire fleet of on-road vehicles were electrified and it will take considerably longer than that given current trends so we have some time to prepare america's electricity infrastructure markets and regulations for widespread adoption but we best not waste that time repeat projects 2024 current policy scenario expects evs to consume the equivalent of about 8% of current total us electricity use by 2030 and 177% by 2035 to put it another way by 2035 eves could consume nearly as much electricity as is produced today by the entire fleet of nuclear power plants or all non-hydro renewables combined so while a lot of attention has recently been paid to increasing demand from data centers and ai electric vehicles are actually likely to be a larger driver of electricity demand growth over the next decade than artificial intelligence ev chargers also represent large new instantaneous power demands that could put stress on grid infrastructure coming home and plugging an eevee into the level two charger is like flipping the switch on about a a dozen or more window mounted air conditioning units fortunately it should be possible to avoid charging evs during peak periods assuming only a modest level of flexible charging repeat project scenarios expect evs to contribute less than 4% of peak us electricity demand in 2030 and 7% by 2035 broader use of managed charging programs could further reduce if not eliminate the contribution of electric vehicles to peak grid uses the technology for that is available today all that's missing are the appropriate incentives thank you thank you very much uh miss gross please proceed mr chairman mr ranking member and members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to testify today i'm br gross the director of transportation at epi e is an independent nonprofit energy research and development institute founded in 1972 the electrification of the transportation sector is challenging from a grid perspective given the size of the load the shorter lead times and the fact that cars and trucks are mobile which means this load can appear just about anywhere on the grid but a load of this size is not unprecedented between 1965 and 2005 the grid adapted to a load twice as large as transportation electrifying transportation is also an opportunity to diversify the load that's currently on the grid which normally shows up as early morning or late afternoon load peaks utilities have to designed for these peak loads to ensure electricity is reliable but um if utilities can take advantage of this typically flexible transportation resource for example to charge most vehicles at night this can help minimize new grid investments and ensure a more affordable transition though the grid impacts of electric transportation will eventually be felt across the generation transmission and distribution systems the near-term impacts are being felt on local distribution systems those wires that lead to our homes our offices fleet depos and charging sites today when we look at the overall imp that 279 million vehicles will have on the grid the like duty vehicles the cars most of us drive every day they will consume the most energy but that load will be distributed across the entire grid and its impact on a local distribution circuit is generally minimal but heavily concentrated fleets such as airport car rental fleets and trucking fleets will bring larger loads to these local distribution systems so in 's work though we consider all loads from light duty vehicles to heavy duty vehicles were especially focused on fleets and trucking loads a challenge that's unique to transportation is the timing mismatch between vehicle procurement and the time it takes to make grid upgrades a fleet operator can can order a dozen heavyduty electric semis to be delivered in about four to six months today yet the time it takes to bring additional power to that site for charging can take anywhere from 18 months on average to multiple years if more significant grid upgrades are required a second challenge is the market complexity there are over 3,000 utilities and tens of thousands of fleet operators who have seldom had to deal with electric utilities this means a fleet operator or a charging property developer with hundreds of sites nationwide has to be able to identify the right utility to begin planning efforts and then figure out how to apply for service when utilities all use different processes to address these pain pain points these key industries have to work together with utilities in unprecedented ways to share their electrification plans earlier with utilities and with utility regulators so that there's advanced knowledge of where and when loads will show up on the distribution system drawing on the expertise of the utility industry fleet ind fleet operators charing providers and vehicle manufacturers we launched the ev to scale initiative and identified two critical tools to address current challenges and enable industry to get to scale the first is an interactive online map that identifies where and when transportation loads are likely to appear on the grid as a local distribution feeder level as fleet operators and charging providers share more of their electrification plans with us confidence grows in where to prioritize these grid investments and this map also now shows how much power is currently available on a utilities feeders to serve these loads to our knowledge this is the first time available hosting capacity maps have been aggregated in a in a single location and made public this online mapping tool is available today the second tool is a standardized service application template for the utility industry that provides fleet operators and charging developers with a common application form to request service for a charging site anywhere in the us this will eliminate much of the time complexity and cost involved in reaching out to one utility at a time and providing the same information to different utilities it is analogous to the college common app process this common app tool is in development will be available by the end of this year leading companies in transportation electrification including amazon enterprise diimler truck volvo truck and many others are working with epi and the utility industry leaders to design these tools to ensure they will address the barriers to large scale electrification of transportation thank you again to the committee for the opportunity to share insights on this important topic i look forward to answering your questions thanks so much miss gross dr jenkins dr henman sorry chairman white house ranking member grassley senator graham and distinguished members of the committee it is my sincere pleasure pleasure to appear before you today my name is moren hinman and i am the chair and co-founder of silverado policy accelerator a nonprofit bipartisan think and do tank focusing on developing novel policy solutions to our most pressing economic environmental and national security challenges through a focus on rigorous research cross-domain policy engagement and granular policy implementation fittingly the challenges before the global battery and electric vehicle supply chain represent a fulcrum of these risks challenging our ability to transition american lives and livelihoods to a clean economy maintain critical manufacturing base and preserve energy independence currently the ev battery sector is following a well- tread pattern of the united states states acting as chief global innovator on critical emerging technologies but falling short on the downstream industrial development because our market economy bound by the rule of law cannot reasonably compete with the openly predatory non-market industrial policies of the chinese communist party to change this script we need to broaden the collective understanding of the impact the ccc the ccp's policies have on global competition and american national security while yielding price distortions that have created low costs for consumers in the short term the ccp's industrial policies ultimately create an unsustainable risk matrix for the united states for example battery cell production costs which comprise about 30 to 40% of the total vehicle production cost set at $114 per kilowatt hour in the united states compared to just $82 per kilowatt hour in china this difference is owed to the fact that materials remain about 30% cheaper in china a cursory look at the ev battery supply chain reveals a troubling state of play china has captured the balance of global supply chains for for refined mineral products battery components and final products including battery cells and electric vehicles for several of the m products that are unavailable within china itself chinese firms own a major stake in mines globally china controls 28% of lithium mines 41% of cobalt mines and nearly 20% of copper mines the ccp achieves these results through an industrial policy playbook i call the successes first china sets specific goals and targets for what it determines to be priority sectors including through sector specific 5-year plans next the ccp shelters its infant industries from markets and comp ition using tools such as tariff and non-tariff barriers and limits on foreign investment simultaneously china subsidizes target industries directly across the value chain and through a variety of payment systems both formal and informal including environmental arbitrage and operating firms in a way that in market economy underpinned by the rule of law could simply not sustain concurrently chinese firms and often the government itself are encouraged to acquire or outright steal foreign technologies and then merge and innovate upon them without the costs associated with legal acquisition of intellectual property once chinese technologies have a tow hold in global markets the ccp subverts competition through a variety of market strategies including undermining market pricing by building overcapacity and production untethered to real demand and then exporting the surplus on on the global market at below cost prices throttling or limiting supply to undermine competitors making strategic investments in adjacent industries and critical infrastructure and key markets and engaging in economic coercion and intimidation finally once china has established a near market monopoly chinese firms sell everywhere at a price of their choosing choosing weaponizing supply chains in their favor the ccp's approach dwarfs other nations efforts not just in strategy but critically in scope scale and consistency across the entirety of the supply chain put simply china unfairly and illegally subsidizes more programs for more critical nodes over a longer period and with more dollars the ccp's stated goal is to establish a global monopoly power in all critical industries and they are well on their way to achieving this end in the ev battery market the international energy agency anticipates that china's battery manufacturing capacity will account for 77% of world demand by 2030 these cheap batteries are no deal effectively countering these efforts will require that the united states and market economies deploy coordinated agile policies at sc at a scale sufficient to correct for the market distortions and to protect us public and private investments in industrial and environmental security silverado and i remain your service as you def devise policies that can meet this generational challenge senators i thank you for your time thank you so much miss hman next is mr scher chairman white house ranking member grassley senator graham and members of the committee my name is david schweer i'm the chief governor affairs and policy officer at the alliance for automotive innovation representing the automakers battery suppliers and uh excuse me producing most of the vehicles sold in the us thank you for the invitation to testify and to share our perspective this morning on the us electric vehicle market and policies to help accelerate this transition today i want to provide the auto industry perspective on the shift towards electrification and to give the committee a status report about not only what's working but also where there's work to be done let's start with this electrification is transforming personal mobility it's rewriting global supply chains rebuilding domestic industrial base and creating jobs an underpinning of the american economy and of course our national security and fundamental ways today 113 electrified products sedans pickups utility vehicles and b models are available for sale in the us this includes battery electric plug-in hybrid and fuel cell vehicles there's also increasingly efficient internal combustion engine technologies lots of choices in powertrain and vehicle type something for sale that meets the needs of every customer choice is a priority for automakers last year 9 and a half% of all us light duty sales were electric or zero emission up from 2.4% in just 2020 even with this major momentum we're in a challenging period as senator gr noted this morning yes the ev market is still growing but the growth is slowing one reason most eveve early adopters have already adopted the technology spikes in eevee demand or choppy growth are certainly not surprising in our view this massive transformation is a marathon not a sprint shifting to electric personal mobility requires nothing short of a complete transformation of the global automotive industrial base and the companies i represent are self-funding this transition and have committed over $125 billion to ev production and battery manufacturing across the country so far this is expected to create a 100,000 jobs at major facilities in south carolina georgia tennessee alabama michigan ohio kentucky kansas indiana and other states my written testimony includes a map of these cutting ed facilities all over the midwest and southeast senators we're building these vehicles and localizing these supply chains here at home right now but the truth is these massive capital transformations are huge bets and they're funded using profits generated from gas powerered vehicles automakers know that a shift at this scale won't happen overnight this transition takes time and patience and it's important to the committee and policy makers to understand these dynamics as well collectively we cannot get ahead of the c customer especially when we are expanding public charging infrastructure or expanding grade capacity finding the right balance between markets and regulations and policy is absolutely key to remaining globally competitive let me take one observation about supply chains this is partially a point about geopolitics namely china that controls a vast amount of raw materials and processing capacity for ev batteries by 2035 the us and is anticipated to have supply gaps in excess of 50% of the needed cathode and anode materials nickel cobalt manganese and graphite at the same time america's allies and rivals are trying to secure the same mineral supplies to support their own electrification goals domestic mining and processing facilities face long lead times for permitting and development as well as other obstacles this is an area where i believe congressional attention and action is needed and i'm actually pleased to know that this morning the senate energy committee is taking up bipartisan permitting reform legislation one last point on china and us competitiveness at the turn of this century china was manufacturing around 2 million vehicles today they manufacture 30 million vehicles and have capacity for nearly 50 million nearly one-third of that production last year was for eves alone in other words china is manufacturing evs equivalent to the entire us manufacturing output without question the future off offers consumers more vehicle choices than ever but we've got some challenges in front of us the auto industry and policy makers need a shared and a realistic vision of success when it comes to automotive electrification regardless of political views or what state you live in we need an approach in this country that balances emission reductions and consumer choice and expands our industrial base and america's ability to compete around the world thank you and i look forward to your questions thanks very much before i turn to mr davis an administrative moment uh to let everybody know that senator graham and i are yielding our uh positions to first senator stabenau and then chair ranking member grassley so the order at the conclusion of mr davis's five minutes will be stabenau grassley white house graham merkley braun at least for openers mr davis please proceed mr chairman mr ranking member senators my name is jeff davis i'm a senior fellow at the eno center for transportation eno is a 501c3 nonprofit nonpartisan think tank founded by traffic pioneer william phelps eno in 1921 uh all federal gasoline and diesel fuel tax receipts along with trucking industry excises have been deposited in a highway trust fund since 1956 to make it clear that those levies on highway users can only be spent on specific highway programs congress has since opened up the trust fund to highway safety and mass transit spending as well the highway trust fund has been fundamentally insolvent since 2008 electrification did not start this problem but it stands to make the problem much worse in the coming years the state of insolvency is a result of three trends first the rate of which driving on us roads increases every year has leveled off from the 1950s to the end of the 1970s total vehicle miles traveled vmt on american roads grew at a pce double every 16 years it slowed to much now the federal high administration this month projected a future rate which would take vmt 140 years to double second tasking the number of gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel used on roads was originally a proxy for taxing vmt in 1976 the average passenger car on the road burned 7.2 gallons of gasoline for every 100 miles driven today the average passenger car on the road burns four gallons of gas every 100 miles for suvs and pickups fuel efficiency increased from 9.3 gallons per 100 miles in 1976 to 5.6 gallons per 100 miles today third congress has been unable to either keep trust fund spending constrainted tax receipt levels or else increase tax receipts congress has now enacted five consecutive multi-year funding bills in which case in which new funding in the final year of each bill was at least 25% above new trust fund taxes and interest uh these trends cause the highway trust fund to run out of money in 2008 before the first plug-in ev and congress has since provided $272 billion in ad hoc bailouts from the general fund now electrification is having its effects according to the congressional budget office's june 24 forecast uh the number of gallons of gasoline tax for the highway trust fund will fall from about 138 billion gallons in 2024 to 89 billion gallons in 2034 annual gasoline tax receipts are projected to drop more than 5% per year starting in 2030 if we combine this newly projected drop in gas tax revenues with currently projected trust fund spending annual cash deficits in the13 billion a year range today will jump to an astounding $ 51 billion deficit in 2034 a decade from now because the trust fund used to be solved on a user pay basis and for other historical reasons trust fund spending is exempt for most of the restrictions and controls in federal spending written into the budget act and subsequent process statutes in this committee's d diic if one were to try to fix that projected $51 billion trust fund deficit in 2034 solely by increasing gasoline taxes and let me emphasize absolutely no one is advocating this uh the current 18.3 cent per gallon gasoline tax to the trust fund would need to be increased by about 58 cents per gallon to a total tax of about 76 cents per gallon of gasoline there are alternatives to motor fuel taxes that could continue the user pay user benefit paradigm that underlies federal trust trust funds which i address in my written testimony but none are nearly as many to easy to administer as the gasoline tax going from fuel to vehicle as the subject of taxation means going from about 1,300 points of collection of gasoline taxes and diesel taxes to 279 million points of collection which is the number of registered private vehicles in the us in 2022 taxing vehicles will be over 200,000 times as much work for the irs as taxing motor fuel in short if rapid decarbonization of highway transportation is to be a federal policy goal congress should carefully consider whether and how to replace the fossil fuel-based highway user taxes that currently support highway and mass trans spending with some other revenue source thank you and i look forward to your questions thanks very much and um i will now turn to the distinguished senator from michigan who i think knows and cares more about the auto industry than pretty much anybody around here thank you so much mr chairman and uh uh and uh senator graham who i know k's passionate about manufacturing we we share that uh uh in common and i could talk all day i won't i know i i don't have all day to talk about this but um let me first start by saying that um no one is forcing americans to buy electric vehicles but i have one nobody forced me to get it my price didn't go up with the the tax credits unfortunately the latest round tax ta credit is so complicated and limiting that i don't it it's certainly not helping as much as it could help um but i will say the biggest issue is charging stations and i'm about to test that again i mentioned to the chairman uh i haven't driven my c from here to michigan about a year and i'm going to test it again to see how many more charging stations we have uh to be able to get me back to michigan uh in a couple of days i do want to emphasize though i've said this before you know in 197 when congress began heavily subsidizing oil production because of fines down in texas we didn't have gas stations on every corner either uh and in fact at the same time henry ford and thomas edison were working to develop a battery operated car but they had no subsidies so congress picked a winner and they won for a 100 years and now we're trying to expand this out and i would say also um senator gram i agree with you we have a lot of issues and i guess what i would say is i think we know more of what the answers are we just need to do it and then we need to find out where um we need to find you know know more about this but chargers not you know we know we need more charging stations electric grid capacity absolutely both of those things are beginning to happen we're investing in that through the bipartisan infrastructure bill a more usable consumer credit uh more american access to where rare earth materials we actually have new mining capacity lithium capacity being developed in nevada which is very exciting because we're way behind i would also say that our companies are looking at using different kinds of technology that don't take all those rare earth materials also recycling which is becoming uh a job creator in michigan for for materials so there's a lot of things uh there more battery production which we know that we need in the united states and of of course we need to change the highway trust fund absolutely but i support american innovation i will tell you in michigan right now we have a stretch of road being built that actually has the charging technology in the road mr chairman so that when you drive you will automatically have your car charged so i support american innovation are we there no but we are certainly getting there and i would also say this our biggest competitor there's no question about it is china but right now our companies are competing against a country that's what's happening there is not a level playing fields specifically china is coming for us uh they want to corner the ev market and their government has heavily subsidized this effort and they've also been willing to steal our patents i should tell you coming from michigan uh so what do we do i mean we i believe have the smartest most talented ao auto workers and automakers in the world uh we need to do our part to help them create a level playing field and that's why i'm so glad that we are doing this this hearing because we're talking about more than 10 million good paying jobs right now so uh mr jenkins in your testimony you mentioned the most important thing congress can do now for the ev sector is to provide policy certainty in continuity could you talk a little bit more about that i know that our private sector our auto makers saving just give me certainty about what's going on yeah by that ian thank you senator uh by that i mean that the tax credits that were implemented in the ira have just been finalized in terms of their guidance and many of the programs authorized and funded by the infrastructure law are authorized to spend down through 2026 so these programs are just getting underway and industry needs to know that they can count on a stable policy environment to make the hundreds of billions of dollars of investments they've announced across the united states and to do that with confidence to drive innovation and to expand our supply chains and so i think the most important thing that can be done now is to provide that confidence for the industry uh with bipartisan support for the maintenance of existing policies um also note that on the consumer side consumers are just getting familiar with how these tax credits work you know january this year we started to offer uh at um at point of sale rebates that's a new thing for people so there's a lot for people to get familiar with we just set the stage let's let our american companies and innovators uh play on that stage and and do what they do best great thank you and mr s uh would you just briefly comment on the same issue sure senator obviously policy certainty is is absolutely essential i mean you talked about not just the certainty as it relates to potential tax incentives but in a competitive environment we need to look beyond just five or 10 years we need to ensure that policies are in place to ensure that the us is competitive not just tomorrow but well beyond that so that certainty is important and senators as you know often times uh the general public forgets about the long lead times in automobile manufacturing and production the decisions made today in calendar year 24 model year 25 are effectively locked manufacturers are already looking out to model years 28 so policies that change today have a material impact but they don't fully uh get realized for years to come so that's why that policy certainty is so important we need to ensure incentives are here to build resilient supply chains to support consumers as well as to attract the investment in the job that we're witnessing thank you thank you mr chairman thanks very much chairman staban now ranking member grassley i'm going to start with dr jen uh your written testimony notes quote president biden established a target to cut us greenhouse gas emissions to half of peak levels by 2030 to reach this goal electric vehicle sales should be making up about 50% of the light duty vehicle market by that date up about five-fold from today your testimony also recognize quote unquote a re remarkable collapse in ev sales this year given the evth evident lack of demand for evs is this biden harris administration goal of five times today's ev ev sales attainable by 2030 great questions uh senator grassley um at this stage i should note that's a goal it's non- minding um and we'll see where consumers go with the products that are being offered on the market i'll note as i did in my oral testimony that most of the collapse and sales all of it really is is tesla who is the market leader responsible for about 45% of all plug-in vehicle sales so if they're stumbling to sell their vehicles it's very difficult to see the overall market expand at a pace that's consistent with that goal but the rest of the market is becoming increasingly diversified we're seeing strong growth in a variety of companies offering more and more products that consumers want at price points that they can afford and we're seeing increased interest from consumers as i mentioned over half of consumers surveyed are interested in buying an ev within the next year not all of them will do so but that indicates substantial opportunity to to grow um and we're in the early stages of this transition uh dr sweer uh your uh written testimony states in bold quote if us policy makers do not support the development commercialization and acceptance of electrified v vehicles our nation risks becoming more dependent on foreign sources for raw materials and critical minerals in the future defined by our competitors you also note that quote china is manufacturing evs on a scale equivalent to the entire manufacturing output of the auto industry in the united states the left is holding up the environmental permitting reform necessary to mine for the domestic critical minerals which we need to compete with china while urging a massive ev market share expansion uh it just doesn't add up so my question should we do more to mine for critical minerals domestically and what specific pieces of environmental legislation should we amend to improve our mining capacity and let me uh suggest before you answer that that maybe a couple months ago i read about the nickel mining in indonesia at the same time that our own government was not allowing such mining in minnesota well senator thank you for those questions uh i would like to underscore that you know again there's record number of options and choices available to consumers today as it relates to the supply chains the best time to start was yesterday the next best time on permitting was to start today so we can't have permitting reform fast enough as it relates to addressing not only what what the us may need for future supply chain resilience but also working with our allies and partners knowing that obviously auto standards are set well into the future and even if we started today with mining and extracting in the us it might be 15 or more years before we may see the benefits of of that extraction processing so again i think that underscores the the critical importance if the us is to remain competitive across all vehicle platforms that the supply chain piece is is fundamental i think you express the inconsistency between environmental policies and what the same environmentals think we ought to do for ev vehicles mr davis as you uh know the federal government highway trust fund has operated at its deficit is currently projected by the congressional budget office to become insolvent in 2028 even though the existing taxes that fund the trust fund generally adhere to user pays principle for surface transportation the federal government has not followed the lead of at least 24 states that impose higher registration fees on evs to compensate for lost gas revenue do you agree that if we want to maintain the user fee pays principle that has traditionally guided these uh trust fund taxes we should ensure evs are also paying their fair share uh thank you senator if you want to maintain the user pay user benefit principle then all vehicles that use the road should pay something uh the question of of what would the proper way be to tax evs is is it depends on first of all if the government is going to shift away from gasoline tax to another method in general if so you tax evs like you tax the rest of them on mileage or whatever if not the the states that are doing uh ev registration fees as long as they are uh around the ballpark cage of what an internal combustion vehicle of the same size and axle weight would do on average mileage uh is a sort of proxy not a great proxy because it it different it doesn't differentiate between the car that drives 3,000 a year and three and the car that drives 30,000 miles a year but uh right now it's about $89 a year is the average in gasoline taxes paid for a passenger car and it's about $110 in federal fuel taxes paid for a larger suv or pickup truck if a annual v if an annual registration for evs were in that ballpark you could you could honestly say that it was as close an approximation of a true user fee as it would be easy for the irs to administer and would be consistent with uh the user pay user benefit principle thank you very much uh senator grassley um miss gross you and dr jenkins both talked about how evs can contribute to our electric grid security um through peak shaving or even putting power back into the grid when it's needed um in terms of peak shaving you'd need the capacity to tell charging evs to stop charging through the peak period and then automatically resume charging uh so you'd need a signal to the automobile from the utility and willingness of the consumer to accept that to do that peak shaving function what does congress need to do to help are there standards that need to be built in is the industry doing it on its own and let me ask you to go first and and dr jenkins if you had added thoughts you can follow up but miss gross you first please sure happy uh thank you senator for the question happy to uh to talk through this one uh yeah the electric vehicles is it's unlike a a load we've ever seen before for um on the grid it's the smartest biggest and most flexible load so there's this huge opportunity to charge the vehicles at night many not all not all not if you're taking a longdistance trip or you're trucking and you have to uh travel during the day but that opportunity to charge when the grid has um spare capacity is a huge opportunity it's going to keep our cost low on the grid too that that capital investment in ever increasing the peak that has to be served on the load on the grid so these this idea that v to g and v1g um either single direction which is basically smart charging charge meaning vehicle to gd make a paron v to g meaning vehicle to grid vehicle to grid perfect uh vehicle to grid is um and also vehicle to grid meaning by and also b directional so that not only can i take power from the grid when there's plenty of surplus capacity at night or maybe when a lot of sun is shining in in some of the states um but i can also give back to the grid when there are times when the grid is struggling to keep up with maybe load on the grid and so v is certainly a promise that's out there there's a lot of work getting uh done in that area but smart is here today you and uh dr jenkins both to provide a written recommendation to senator graham and to myself about what we might do working together to make sure that as evs come online they have the necessary capability so that the consumer can take advantage of that capability and also if you're going to offer utility that capability that adds value to the utility what benefit should the consumer get from the utility for uh offering up their vehicle as a resource either by taking it willingly offline during peak periods or by limiting charging to the night or however that works it's a bit of a complicated question but i think there's room for real bipartisan activity here and i'd love to have a recommendation from uh both of you um in my remaining two minutes uh miss henman first of all thank you for all your uh terrific work you've described the economic and national security risks of chinese which you called weaponized supply chains is there also a climate risk associated with uh china's supply chains um yes uh thank you so much senator absolutely so um china's and is there a policy that would help fix that i i i think i i think i know of at least one um there china's rent seeking also arrives in this form of sort of what we call environmental arbitrage or um creating a pollution subsidy so essentially how it works even though china has the technical capacity to enforce its own environmental rules um because it produces many of those in technologies and in fact their pollution control in particular is the world's leading exporter of of of air pollution control technology um there's widespread evidence that china uh particularly among their state own enterprises intentionally reduces its inspection rates and then refuses to operate its air pollution control um machinery now if you look like a coal fire power plant scrubber if you leave that scrubber off that reduces your energy cost of operation of air pollution control um uh materials by about 15 to 20% total so you're you're getting a 15 to 20% pollution subsidy on your total energy production for every that you produce that comes off that coal firepower plant um i i don't know a single manufacturing firm in the united states that wouldn't love a 20% subsidy on their energy costs um this is deeply unfair it's it's unfair in terms of competitive sense but also in a climate and environmental sense because that is uh socks knx and of course carbon and other and other um um climate pollutants being pumped up into the air um at at a deeply unfair rate that advances our um um sort of uh decline in in terms of of climate stability um one important way that we could counter this is that both the united states and and friends could actually levy a border fee that corrects for this market imbalance and levels the playing field in terms of both climate and other uh pollution values um the figures behind this are known and i know there's several very good bills floating around the hill right now both on the quantification side but also on the particulars on those measures and how we might work with partners and that makes the perfect segue to senator graham who along with senator cassidy has a bill to that effect and i would note that uh ambassador leiser who is president trump's trade representative is also a fan of that policy so with with that let me turn it over to uh senator graham and thank him again for uh put helping put this hearing together well and i thank you and senator grassle for having because this is the first of many conversations i think we're going to have uh mr schwier is that did i say your name right schweer twer i'm sorry it's a mouthful how about david okay um david um are car companies making electric vehicles because they have to or they want to senator i think there's no question as you noted earlier that electrification is the future uh so for purposes well i mean is it the future based on consumer demand or government policy i would say it's a mix obviously i think regulations are i agree um mr jenkins why does does china make electric vehicles because of climate policy no it's primarily a response to strategic manufacturing policy and air pollution reduction goals um they basically strategically selected electric vehicles as an opportunity to leap frog internal combustion engine manufacturing which is an area that the west the united states but it's not driven by climate i mean really worried about climate you wouldn't use a goldf fired plant to to power a electric vehicle plant right well with china's average grid mix it actually does reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to an internal so are they making all these cars because they worried about the environment they're worried primarily about air pollution and their strategic role in manufacturing in the global market miss h hinman um why do we make electric cars is it because of consumer demand or government policy um my sense is it's it's a it's a perine my colleague to the my left is it's because it's it's combination of the two but you know market economy so the government does work some people want them right so david if we did away with the mandate or the goal of having half the vehicle fleet electrified a government policy uh by 2035 what percentage of the cars on the road you think would be electri without a mandate senator that's a very good question last year was 9.5% so if we fast forward um it's it's hard to say a lot of it depends on how reliant we are let's just say we did away with a mandate trump says he wants to do away well will that end electric car manufacturing in america no however we might have unbalanced things as it relates to whether or not the us is competitive as it relates to some of those supportive policies whether it's tax incentives or right yes so miss uh hinman um is that right henman it's hinman okay all right is the dominance of china irreversible in the supply chain i believe not absolutely not i think the us and its allies and friends if we move quickly to create agile responsive and coordinated policies could flip the script and um reestablish market dynamics in the global economy i want to talk to you about that more detail so forget about what we do here mr jenin does everybody agree china's going to continue to make a bunch of electric vehicles no matter what we do correct everybody agree with that yes sir for whatever reason they're going to make a bunch of them and uh it seems to me that the supply chain to make a battery uh if we don't change our policy is going to be so dominated by china we may just have lost this entire area of our economy is that fair to say mr david yes uh senator i would note and this is something that hopefully resonates with this committee um if we didn't have the regulations uh obviously electrification is a future if the us is taking itself off the global stage for competition for instance on average we're exporting 2 million vehicles a year so if the us isn't competing on electrification and the rest of the world is we've got a real risk well that's what bmw is trying to do in volvo in south carolina can you be for uh evs and against mining mr jenkins well i think we need to source the requisite materials for the entire supply chain and know the environmental impact of that is substantially lower than mining billions of tons of coal or billions of tons equivalent of oil each year that we light on fire okay that's good so if you're for evs you need to be for mining here at home does that make everybody agree with that if you're for evs you need to have a robust grid do you agree with that miss gross i agree with that because the demand is real mr jenkins are you opposed to natural gas as being part of the future of the grid natural gas generations is going to remain a part of the grid for quite some time particularly for capacity needs so to meet peak demands and so so without natural gas it'd be pretty unrealistic to meet the demand that said we're going to see a reduction in the amount of natural gas consumed by those power plants as we scale up uh american renewable energy resources that can displace gas burnt not the capacity as a base load fuel a renewables are going to get us to where we need to go without natural gas and nuclear power senator we don't need a base load fuel we need is a combination of resources that can meet all of our demands through rout the year renewables are great at supplying energy but they're reliably unreliable we know they're not going to be there all the time gas power plants are dispatchable as well as nuclear power plant res i know i'm 18 seconds over here what i want to do is just think it through uh i'm at a car heavy state and they're making evs and i agree with you i think the mandate is probably pushing us i don't like it but i think consumers are going to demand some electric v vehicles china is not going to change your policy it seems to be a part of the the future economically and if we don't watch it we're going to be out of the battery business and i would just like to have a rational approach to what i think is an irreversible trend that there'll be more electric cars over time not less and i think it'd be a shame to not play in this space for whatever reason drives you no pun intended uh i think america's going to make some real hard decisions quickly and if we do it we will dominate this market no matter how big it is or how small it might be i'd like to dominate this market for a lot of reasons or at least be competitive i met with the chinese ambassador yesterday and i'll close with this i said we're going to have an honest discussion about the way you produce electric cars get ready for that discussion i think um before i turn to senator merkley there is a very significant bipartisan common cause towards cleaner energy lower emissions and taking back chinese dominance in this area that they have achieved to use miss henman's words unfairly through mercantilistic interventions and uh cheating essentially in the marketplace so we need to have ways to respond to that to make sure we are not dependent on their supply chains for national security economic and climate safety reasons and i think there's a big bipartisan opportunity so i'm delighted that we're having this and senator graham i fully look forward to working with you to flesh out what those strong bipartisan policies look like that support our autom manufacturers and the workers who build these beautiful vehicles uh senator merkley and then here's the here's the here's the roster senator merkley senator braun senator kane senator johnson uh thank you mr chairman and certainly one of the reasons they're so much interested in my home state uh in electrics is because of what's happening right now we have 121 fires burning in my state over 1 million acres have already burned uh this year uh two weeks ago we had more acreage of flame than all the rest of the united states uh combined massive impact on all parts of our state both with the fires and the and the smoke we simply have to dramatically reduce the amount of methane and carbon dioxide we're putting into the atmosphere but i'll tell you another reason it's so appealing is because of the cost differential now mr jenkins or dr jenkins you were talking about the peak load pricing challenge uh my local utility offers a plan where if i'm charging after 9900 p.m. it's 7.4 cents per kilowatt hour if i charge from 5: to 900 p.m. which is peak load in my area it's 33 cents so uh we have a little note on our drive for reminding us to turn it on after 9:00 p.m. but it really has an impact on on simply turning on our charger at 9:00 p.m. at at night and our at 220 volts our car is completely charged even it's depleted by the next morning uh mr chairman you were mentioning the the question on whether we need a sophisticated system to tell the cars this is a this is a system that doesn't require anything sophisticated it's just uh a pricing plan that where people remember to turn on their their electric chargers for their for their cars at night and it makes a um shifts a huge part of our electric consumption in that in that fashion now let's take that u uh cost that we're paying of 7.4 cents let's run it off to 8 cents we get over four miles per kilowatt hour basic math it's costing us two cents per mile to charge our or to drive our car now would take our gas in 40 mil per hour per gallon at $4 that's 10 so it's five times more expensive to drive a fuel powered car why do we never hear about this if it was the reverse and driving your electric car was five times more expensive than driving your your fuel combustion car you can bet uh every uh fossil fuel company in america would be publicizing that why don't we hear that it's five times cheaper to drive an electric car u dr jenkins you want to comment on that well i do think you rais a great point senator merkley uh there we're at the early stages of this transition and i think we do need a lot more advertising and proactive efforts to educate the public from the industry itself from automakers and and dealerships uh and from potentially from from public uh sources as well it's a significant cost differential the upfront purchase prices are higher and that's another reason why the tax credits established by the ira are critical to bring down that upfront purchase price if you build that into the cost of a lease uh which how many people are turning to to to uh purchase new evs that that is basically a $7,500 additional down payment on the on the vehicle and that covers a large amount of the depreciation that you would normally pay for in your lease payments and that's why the cheapest vehicles on the market right now to lease in virtually every category are electric vehicles so it's not just cheaper when you operated it could be cheaper on a monthly payment basis as well today well i've talked to a lot of folks who previously were intimidated by those high upfront prices and they're buying used electrics now that we're this far into it they're buying a used tesla and or a used used whatever um and because even though the amount of range declines modestly over over time you still starting with enough range you have a lot of range uh left uh i want to i um so it's really becoming much more affordable to middle class families through both both points that you're making about leasing and about being able to buy a used uh vehicle i want to turn to this issue that senator stabo raised about the charging stations uh one of the things that uh has and uh interesting is how slow we've developed a national standard for the interface we now have the north american charging standard the knack standard rivan's adopted it ford's adopting it uh or has adopted it uh chevy's adopting it next year so mr chairman your chevy bolt uh your next chevy bolt will be able to use the ax standard uh and um and nisson adopting it so that's starting to become a a solved uh problem uh but one of the ways we could rapidly expand the ability of folks who have cars currently is to have electric charging changes ch chargers at rest stops however national law federal law prohibits that is is that something we should change um yes miss gross would you like to comment on that well we don't normally comment on policy at at uh at eie however if you don't want to comment somebody else anybody else want to comment however more charging stations are are you know um required they're they're going to be necessary and they're going to be required for consumers consumers demand it they're going to need it are all of the charging stations that are going to be deployed under the inflation reduction act going to have a a standard does anybody know the answer to that i don't believe that's required but uh it's increasingly the case that all chargers are converging to the next standard going forward and there are adapters now coming to market that allow interoperability there's already the the reverse you can plug your tesla into a ccs charge port with an adapter i'm still waiting for ford to ship me my uh adapter for my mustang mai but they're sending them for free to all owners of existing ford vehicles so this is going to become an increasingly solv problem as you noted this is the magic dock adapter right or just any others um so yeah so i'm you can have your own adapter you just carry with you and your frunk okay uh listen my my time's up uh but i just want to close with this uh everyone it's five times cheaper per mile to drive an electric and if you buy a used electric you don't have to worry about the upfront high cost because the depreciation been paid by somebody else uh and it's a sweet deal and dr jenkins had to show off that he has a mustang ma mackie after i said i only had chevy bolts senator brun thank you mr chairman the average cost of an electric vehicle is over $177,000 more than the average uh price of a gas powered vehicle so we're doing a lot that is force feeding something in that's very expensive uh we got other issues with it in the context of here we're borrowing now a couple trillion dollars a year where it was just a trillion dollar six months ago and everything we do new it's 100% borrowed i think what i'm uh wondering and i'd like to ask dr jenkins miss gross and miss henman given the this context do the three of you believe that consumers should have the right to choose the type of vehicle that best fits their own needs economic circumstances or do you think we ought to be orchestrating this from here when we've never even figured out how to spend less than we take in and we're currently borrowing from these very same consumers and others around the world to the tune of $2 trillion a year currently senator i would say that consumers do have the option to choose the vehicles that best suit them we have a wide variety of offerings on the market today and no requirement that anyone anywhere purchases an electric vehicle the prices are increasingly affordable as well so this is a moving target uh cost of batteries which are the largest component of an electric vehicle have fallen by about 50% over the last three years and are expected to continue to decline going forward and so that cost premium you said at $177,000 i looked right now uh in the compact suvs category like a you know mustang mai or or tesla model y the the gap's about $10,000 up front and again the the cost of ownership is quite low so the total cost of ownership is already about a parody do you know the current um federal subsidy that goes into electric vehicles what the amount is per vehicle it's up to $7,500 for the consumer you know what that is uh in total uh that we're currently doing i believe i just read it was about 125 billion or would you agree that all of that's being borrowed uh to push that on to uh consumers well cbo's estimate was that the inflation reduction act was more than paid for so i'm not sure i agree with that i'd say that's a fake pay for but thank you for your opinion okay we'll go uh to miss gross and miss henman um senator thank you for that question i'll just add without commenting too much on the policy i'll just add that consumers are choosing these vehicles uh senator merkley talked about the energy wallet the fact that um you can feel it in your pocketbook when you don't have to go to the gas station and the cost of electricity is so much less um when you're charging an electric vehicle i'll also say that truck drivers uh data out there shows that truck drivers actually like driving electric vehicles uh because you don't experience that fatigue that you have with the rumble in the and the roar of a of a of a combustion engine vehicle so this issue of fatigue is also a safety issue so we're starting to see you know there is there are reasons to to want to drive an electric vehicle based on data that's out there that are really um extreme um compelling for automakers and truck drivers out there manufacturers miss hman yeah thank you so much senator i think it's an it's a little bit of an uncomfortable conversation to have about the fact that we've got a very large predatory market who is influencing prices up and down the value chain in ways that us that americans just can't simply compete with and to me this sense of sort of how much we're spending is really hard to sort of square against the massive amount of spend and predatory nature that occurs uh from the chinese communist party um you know in a perfect world we this would be a pure you know a global market right and we wouldn't we wouldn't feel the need to have to subsidize in the way that we do i do think there's scope for new tools particularly trade policy tools and environmental policy tools of the border but uh certainly you know i think some of these distortions we have to kind of appreciate its source which is not coming from americans but it's coming from an adversary overseas thank you and i got one more question but i'd like to also tell you that it was about n9 months ago and uh i was uh holding up a letter from uh 4,000 dealers that said please don't send us any more evs and i'm for the cleanest least expensive and like the idea that it's out there as a choice but 4,000 dealers said they are choking on them it's even hurt their own enterprises to have to tie it up because they're not moving at the speed at which the government would like to see it even when they're offering 7500 bucks a pop uh got one more uh question and uh i'd like a yes or no answer on the part of all of you um i'm for whatever is going to be the cleanest least expensive fuel in the long run and even how that impacts electric generation transportation the whole gamut there's been a very robust discussion in the senate clim caucus on that which i was part of that uh we still have great conversations but a lot of it says that so much of this is going to be due to technological breakthroughs in the future and as much as we'd like to see those results in the present we either can't afford it just doesn't make sense to do it now as it relates to electric vehicles to all witnesses does the us currently have the grid capacity to sustain a growing domestic vehicle fleet that is being mandated on consumers by policies from the biden administration in respecting time just give me a yes or no we can dr jenkins we can expand the grid at a pace that's sufficient to accommodate all of those evs as we have in the past this is not an unprecedented challenge it's one that american utilities can easily meet with planning and investment uh the pace can be met and grid can be ready yes we can meet we can meet the uh demands today and we need to plan for the future absolutely yes if you start today and anticipate where the ev demand will be 10 years from now you can get there thank you so much mr chairman can i correct the record on one of the statements i just made the the total tax outlays this year according to treasury are $1 billion for the ev subsidies to date that's so that's through the first half of this year um that i think i misspoke by several orders of magnitude so i apologize about that thank you jenkins senator kane thank you mr chair and i i love walking in and seeing the title of the hearing bipar and senate budget committee hearing and i appreciate that this has been a hearing and a discussion with witnesses who are really trying to explore an opportunity that has a real upside that is going to need some planning and investment um in virginia there's 100,000 electric vehicles on the road in my commonwealth of eight plus million people and those who charge at their home um pay about a dollar a gallon that's that's what folks in virginia are paying if they charge at their home uh we need to have some advances in charging in richmond where i live a lot of people don't have driveways apartments or or multif family communities so more curbside rest area um we need to make sure in the deployment of charging technologies we're not just looking at passenger vehicles but we're also looking at at trucks um every volvo mac truck that you see on the road in north america is made in dublin virginia um and which is in appalachia about 3,000 workers there um in the last 10 days the doe announced a $28 million investment through the inflation reduction act to match an equivalent investment by the company to expand uh electric vehicle production i i i would encourage if anybody ever wants to do something fun come with me to dublin and drive an over the road volvo truck on their test track it's about a three mile test track um you'll get in that vehicle and it's so smooth you think you're going 35 and i looked down at the speder i was going 65 the point about fatigue was remarkable a a diesel truck just has this kind of lowgrade rattle that really takes the toll on over the road drivers if they're in that truck for multiple hours a day whereas the electric vehicle is as smooth as can be and so it is going to be a kind of a fatigue health um improvement for those who are doing this job it's hard to recruit enough over the road drivers now i think this is a technology that might make it a little bit easier but um in addition to the $28 million investment into the volvo plant through the ira uh there's also been the announcement in the last year of a hundred million investment through doe to a company called microporus a company that will manufacture separators for lithium ion batteries that are necessary for the ev supply chain and that is likely to land in rural southside virginia near danville both dublin virginia and danville virginia are an economically hard- hit parts of the state they're both in rural virginia talk a little bit about how the growth of an ev supply chain could be a powerful economic development tool for rural america and thanks senator i mean look my my father's from youngstown ohio i grew up in oregon in the shadow of the timber industry and forest products industry that had decayed you know uh during my childhood ood i've been hearing you know politicians talking about bringing manufacturing jobs back to america literally my entire life right and we're finally doing it right we're seeing those investments now across you know evs uh clean energy uh batteries uh semiconductors etc so we're already seeing over $140 billion of announced investment in battery manufacturing and supply chain capacity across the country and 57 billion in eeve manufacturing that's since the infrastructure law uh passed um that could support over 20 240,000 jobs jobs and we all know these are more than just the direct employment right these are anchor employers in in these industries and or in these communities and over uh the vast majority of those are located in rural and exurban communities or or communities are designated as energy communities by the inflation reduction act so these are exactly the communities that are seeing a say last say that last piece again yeah vast majority the vast majority are in rural and exurban areas and and the energy communities that have traditionally relied on fossil fuel extraction processing or transportation that were designated by the ira um this is a hearing about electric vehicles but the same week that the announcement was made about doe supporting the manufactur of electric over the road vehicles in in dublin there was also an ira driven announcement of $100 million to a facility that is opening up in ches peake virginia which is in the hampton roads area metropolitan area but it's going to manufacture in the united states for the first time the cables that connect to offshore wind and put the power into the grid all of this has been manufactured overseas because we didn't have an offshore wind industry now because of the ira we will be manufacturing those cables and not just for use in us offshore wind those cables and the company is a korean company that's investing in virginia will be manufactured in the united states and then sold to offshore wind development all over the united states just another example of an ira success story okay now here's a personal story that's embarrassing um i got stuck in my car for 27 hours in january of 22 driving from richmond to dc and uh it was 18° when the sun was up it was colder overnight and it was a freak snowstorm and this the signs on the highway said proceed with caution they didn't say turn around go home they said proceed with caution i proceeded with caution and i stuck for 27 hours my my senior senator mark warner said i would have gotten seal team six to come out and get me you sat there with the doctor pepper and orange for 27 hours there was a lot of concern about what would happen to electric vehicles i had in a gas vehicle i had to you know run the engine for 10 minutes with the heat of full blast turn it off until the car got too cold an hour later and do it again to try to take my half tank of gas and make it work and there was a lot of questions about what would happen to electric vehicles that night and i've never introduced into the senate record an article from kelly blue book but i just thought there's the first time for everything kelly blue book did a study they they re out to people who had been stuck in that snowstorm who were driving teslas or other electric vehicles and they found out that they actually performed better than gas vehicles and that the way electric u vehicle engines work you can operate just a small portion of the engine that runs the heater you don't have to have the engine running for the whole car it does drain the you know the reserve but very slowly when finally the traffic started to move it was blocked by the fact that so many vehicles had run out of gas that even trying to move on the ice driven roads you were kind of like a jenga game you're kind of moving here there and everywhere to kind of get around them um but it turned out that the electric vehicles performed quite well in those adverse conditions and so mr chair if i could let me introduce this article from kelly bluebook i95 traffic nightmare what if you were stuck in an electric car for 24 hours into the record without objection it shall be entered into the record i y back and we turn now to senator johnson who will be followed by senator van holland so to prove my environmental bonafides here i have a my wife has a hybrid suv pretty good size one and uh we've actually had it up over 30 miles per gallon that's when she plugs it in every now and again she doesn't so i think we're down to about 28 right now so we watch that okay i've always wondered it's interesting senator kane you mentioned a dollar a gallon is that a i don't know i've never heard really what does it cost is that is that about right that it's equivalent of about a dollar a gallon per gas to charge a ev versus what it costs on the for gallon gas whoever whoever's got the information yeah senator i think that's fair obviously it's going to base largely on the utility rates but i think the the working numbers anywhere from you know 2/3 less costly uh compared to a gallon equivalent so whether it's $1 or dollar let's say it's about a third of the cost again but that's pretty attractive okay uh you've got the smooth ride u you got fast acceleration there's a lot of benefits okay as well as in the fact if you're just using a hybrid like my wife does driving around town come never even has to use gas so i'm not opposed but my question is if they've got so many market appeals why do we need government subsidies take it up i i would say you don't we should end them mr schweer sure senator obviously you're talking about affordability generally excuse me obviously when it comes to the record number of of products it's both the industrial policy as well as you know the market dynamics we we mess up when we you know government doesn't do very well for example we spent s and half billion dollars right to do charging stations after more than two years we've got seven of them you know testimony was talking about we've run we we've basically run the highway tr fund into insolvency and we haven't really fixed that you know why is why is china producing all these electric vehicles for its own home market it's for central planning sure industrial engineering in other countries correct is is there any major western country that doesn't subsidize evs because of climate alarmism h how many us automakers are making money producing evs uh senator as i said in my remarks we're we're in the early innings this is a marathon not a sprint so yes costs are going to have to come down well how much are they losing on average uh it depends on the manufacturer and their product cycle so why are they doing it uh it al because because they're getting sub government subsidies right the consumers are being subsidized and the automakers are also being subsidized correct and the mandate we're talking about the things like cafe standards that coers them to offer evs so they can produce vehicles that american consumers do want i mean i'd never go to 100% ev happy to do the hybrid happy to be environmental i want the comfort of having an internal combustion engine yeah senator as it relates to the the recent auto standards we've been pretty clear with the biden administration obviously we need to ensure that there's alignment as it relates to where the market is as well as encouraging there won't there won't be alignment where the market is government's not that smart i mean honestly $7.5 billion we have seven charging stations we've run the highway trust fund back 2008 in solvent we haven't fixed that problem and we're going to have this command economy and we're going to plan for a growth in the electrical grid by the way we don't have the min the mining capacity i would argue we really don't have the electrical capacity those climate alarmists are generally opposed to nuclear which certainly would be part of the problem china dominates the battery industry and our subsidies are providing a market for china's command economy how does any of this make sense senator just with respect our our subsidies are targeted to us manufacturing of uh of batteries through 45x and the consumer ev tax credits are specifically designed to excise china from how how many consumers have experience the cost of replacing a battery in an ev it's an extremely rare occurrence extremely rare occurrence it's going to they don't last forever do they how long they last neither does an internal combustion engine car or transmission how there are car on the road from the 30s and 40s and 50s how long is an ev battery going to last and what is the cost to replace it ev batteries account for anywhere from 30 to 40% of upfront cost obviously there's warranty and durability built into those batteries but yes how long do they last um the battery itself can last quite some time and then of course it can be repurposed and reused a couple hundred thousand miles at least we've have teslas on the road with that many miles already it's going to cost 10 $20,000 to replace well that's the cost to what about what about recycling of them what about recycling of wind turbines i'm seeing these pictures of these massive dumps of these wind turbines just collapsing and again this this it doesn't make economic sense because government is trying to centrally plan and government's awful at it um i just wanted to pipe in if i i i could sir on on battery recycling batteries are eminently recyclable and are near not these not the lithium batteries we don't have capacity for doing it right right now devel doing it we are building that capacity and certainly the us is a leader in the standards kind of like senator brown was talking about yeah we have to rely on all these technological innovations we don't have yet let's face we they've been trying to innovate batteries for decades and really haven't been able to do it have they not sure i would agree with that the cost have fallen dramatically the density has doubled in the last uh nine years or seven years so battery innovation is is dramatic and with that's so let the marketplace dictate the speed of this in ation stop subsidizing this that's that's my only point again i'm not opposed to it but i'm opposed to government intervention in the marketplace we just screw things up and as senator brun said we can't afford it $35 trillion in debt we just can't afford all this stuff but thank you mr van uh thank you mr chairman thank all of you for your testimony i just make a couple points at the outset when you have a a huge um what economists call externality uh which is climate change i i know some of my colleagues don't really believe in that uh as a as a threat uh but that is exactly where you want government action and i also heard senator graham at the outset talk about how uh china will potentially is right now you know on on a road if we don't do something about it to eat our lunch i mean the reality is countries around the world consumers around the world are going to be purchasing electric vehicles um and either we're at the top of our game uh or we're going to be uh left dramatically behind so that's why i'm pleased that maryland uh is one of the states that has set very ambitious goals uh in terms of evs um target for 3,000 by 2025 and we're one of 15 states that have committed to ramp up the electrification of medium and heavy duty trucks so that all sales uh of those vehicles are zero emmission by 2050 uh there's been lots of um evidence of the health benefits of this uh the rocky mountain institute estim ates that uh among the 15 states that along with maryland are participating in this effort um they will see fewer premature deaths 477 fewer premature deaths and over 6,000 fewer asthma incid incidents per year and that's 3.5 billion a year and that's uh on top of the climate benefits i think it's important to point out to my colleagues that while uh heavyduty trucks medium and medium trucks account for only 10% of vehicles on the road they produce about a quarter uh of the overall uh greenhouse gas emissions so uh one of the challenges that volvo um which is a company in hagertown maryland uh is facing and and they develop the the powertrain manufacturing uh the power trains they have a facility there one of the issues they have there is the qu is the issue of charging infrastructure for medium and heavyduty trucks so miss gross could you briefly describe some of the challenges uh we're facing in this particular sector and what we should be doing about it thank you senator for that question um let me focus on the solutions first and then i'll go to maybe recap on some of the challenges the the most important thing that we can do in the sector for for the for um heavy duty medium duty sector is to get pilot programs out there it is amazing what fleet operators learn by just um purchasing and putting into their fleet the first one two trucks understanding what the relationship has to be with the utility understanding what charging is how it works what it means to discuss rates and off peak times and on peak times um and what the economic opportunities are to actually um work with utility on those rates so the fleet this idea that we need to continue pilot programs is really alive it's not the ones that have already started it but every fleet in the in the country should start to understand um what it would mean to actually have that experience behind behind you once you have that experience you make better decisions about right sizing charging and right sizing the grid requirements for it um we need to prioritize feeders um where are these truckloads uh likely to show up so we've got the eoad map uh out there that describes and shows you visually where the the loads are expected to come from we've got volvo data dino truck data we know we have the telemetry we know where the diesel uh vehicles travel throughout the country so being able to prioritize where they are today and where they're likely to be when they're electric is super super important for prioritizing these investments on the grid and then finally um one interesting thing is we are kind of going about this peace meal today um this is this holds true for light duty vehicles as well but on the medium and heavy duty trucking sector where these loads can be very concentrated at on local distribution systems we um we wait you know the utility industry um can really only invest once a customer shows up and says hey i've got this load coming um can you please um you know upgrade the grid for me i'm coming with this charging load if we would step back and consider you know in in in its totality how much load is coming when more fleets 20% 40% 80% we could do a better job up front more costeffective job of putting these solutions in place i so i would almost uh i would encourage um everyone to focus on sort of those big nuances about the trucking sector that are important and this whole timing mismatch i know that that's on top of mine for volvo as well on the timing mismatch between the time it takes to get grid power to a site versus the time it takes to to order a few semi- trucks and i i said in my testimony earlier uh i can order a fleet of semi electric trucks and they can be delivered in four to six months and and the grid upgrades probably can't be made in those same four to six months so we've got to get a hold we got to get ahead of this challeng so this this is the issue i mean volvo is actually losing orders right now um from people that want to you know purchase these um electric uh medium heavy duty trucks but can't because of this uh issue of charging stations so i i hope we will uh on a relatively urgent basis move forward i mean this is the sort of chicken and the egg problem we've seen um in other parts of this sector um i may have some questions to submit for the record but i see my my time is out thank you mr chairman senator van holland u senator gra and i spoke earlier about trying to pull together some bipartisan technical recommendations for facilitating the uh transition in a whole variety of ways things like supporting peak shaving and this would be another good example so uh look forward to working with you on that thank you very much for your interest now we turn to senator kennedy that's always happ thank you mr chairman welcome to our witnesses i'm sorry i was late i was in another committee um how many of you drive an electric car own an electric car okay you gentlemen don't if you mean electric by a battery electric no if you mean pluging electric yes okay um of the three folks who raised their hands do do how many el do do you own gasoline powered cars at all no no senator no no all electric okay um let me ask you all this and please give me brief answers because i've only you there are five of you there's only one of me okay if electric cars are so swell how come we have to pay people to drive them the upfront costs of an electric vehicle are about $110,000 higher today than they are for an equivalent internal combustion engine vehicle today but that cost is declining substantially and so this is a a temporary intervention to help the auto industry strategically compete in global markets and to transition as battery hear my admonition okay sorry doc how about if if if electric vehicles are so swell how come we have to pay people to drive them i i think i'll sorry senator um i'll i'll stay away sorry i can't see the names oh i'm it's gross miss gross here um i'll defer to not comment on policy questions about incentives and so on maybe tell your name i can't see your name tag uh gross i can oh okay i'm sorry i can swivel it i'm apologize would you start over i i was just going to say i'd like to defer on policy grounds not to talk about um policy incentives and so on defer over to uh my colle here miss henman you don't believe in electric cars oh totally totally support electric vehicles and drive three of them myself so so if they're so swell how come we're having to pay people to drive them so just speaking person so just speaking personally then not representing my company at this point sure speaking personally who's your company uh eie the electric power res research institute oh okay um and i have to be careful about policy stepping into uh waiting too deeply into policy as an independent um leader here but when i when we think about again i i just want to ditto what dr jenkins uh said this is an effort to compete i know all that but but how if they're so swell how come we have to pay people to drive them well maybe then the quick answer for me is i didn't take advantage of incentives um but i also bought used vehicles on the market i love it they're wonderful to drive that's okay um senator um similar for myself i we uh moren hinman damn my hair is longer in my picture sorry i'm sorry i don't even know who i'm talking to go ahead miss h i did i did want to follow up with my colleague uh m gross uh i purchased my first ev um ful yes ma'am but but if so sw how come we have to pay people to drive well we i purchased d for i can only speak for myself but we purchased our first uh vehicle in 2015 um because it was easier to charge cheaper to drive it drives better faster um smoother there's no muck on the bottom of our garage and frankly when i had my first child um some of the safety features were just better but here's what i'm i'm i'm sorry you're not answering my question how many vehicles how many cars we do we have in the united states 20 280 this lady right here in the middle i'm sorry if i could see your name i'd wouldn't just point to you i i if i could i' i'd like to defer to my colleague who has like to hear your answer okay how many calls how many million okay and what percentage your electric vehicle 1.6 okay hold up that chart here's here's where all electric vehicles are california loves them the west coast loves them everybody else is kind of lukewarm okay i'm trying to understand why but let me move on to this let me ask these these two gentlemen i think the reason is is because they're more expensive and people people don't people when they drive a car like it to run and when it runs out of electricity it stops and they can't find a place to charge so let me ask these two gentlemen i don't want to be unfair so it's clear we got a long way to go we got 283 mill ion cars in america and we got 3.3 million uh electric vehicles we got a long way to go and at least these three folks think that that we need to to to take taxpayer money and give enough money to american people so they'll walk away from gas cars and drive electric vehicles how much is that going to cost i'm gonna ask them in a second if i have time but um how much do you think it will cost for us to basically uh bribe every american to drive an electric car well senator uh excuse me dave sweder with the alliance for automotive innovation i would just underscore your original question with this there's really a two things at play as it relates to what's how much money you think it'll cost the american people enough to make them drive electric car to move that those numbers uh electrification increasing as it relates to cost only a fraction of currently eligible vehicles eligible for the federal tax credit so how much do you think it'll cost david senator i think i i quoted earlier that i'm calling on you sir apologies how much do you think it'll cost it ultimately depends on consumer option do you we don't have an exact figure we just keep throwing money at it until we hit the jackpot how about you mr davis uh eventually if you put enough charging station that to s for range anxiety because reason i didn't buy one it's because i may have to drive 450 miles to east tennesse the american taxpayer for us to to to to to convince the american people frankly just bribe the american people to get rid of the gas car and drive an electric car have any of you can any of you give me a figure senator we the treasury department reports we spent about a billion dollars year to date so for the first half of this year so roughly $2 billion this year i noted how much do you think it'll cost doctor you're you're doctor so $2 billion this year is what the estimate from the treasury department how much do you think it will cost for us to let's say get 75% of these 200 how much will it cost american consumers to remain uh how much do you know how much it'll cost do no one knows the future with certainty senator right you just think we ought to keep throwing money at it until we hit the jackpot i think we ought to set a stable policy framework that allows american consumers to become familiar with the environment and american businesses to innovate and to compete within that stable framework that's what i said cost will cost less than the benefits delivered by the don't care how much it costs do you i care if the benefits exceed the cost i don't care about the cost these are investment in the much cost do you i care very much how much it costs as long as the benefits exceed the cost that's an investment worth making well so okay how much does it cost to seed the industries of the future to china i get i get to ask the questions doc you're at princeton right that's correct yeah how are jewish students doing it princeton are they feeling better that has nothing to do with the the hearing today i'm not going com i didn't think you'd want to talk about that um do any of you have any idea how much it would cost senator get say 75% of the american people senator electric cars if i could your your question is fair one answer to it is the cost of inaction of the us not competing is far greater than any incentive on the front end okay quantify that farming oh man i'm way over i'm sorry shel quantify that for me because here's my don't why don't you wrap up with this because i think everybody's had a chance to try to answer your question and repeating it at this okay we all want clean air we all want bright water we all want to eat and we all want to live indoors okay um but there are tradeoffs in all of this despite what the princeton professor thanks um u we don't have unlimited money this is not prin so we have to decide the cost and the benefits and nobody seems to be able to quantify the costs they just say keep throwing money at it throwing money at throwing money at and nobody can really quantify the benefits except if we don't do it then we're all going to die and when i go back to my people and say your electricity costs have gone up 30% but it's for a good cause why can i because you're going to die if we don't do it why kennedy because a professor at princeton says so that doesn't work for most americans can you answer that for me you see my frustration i love i love driving an electric car i think they're really cool but the median household income in my state's $55,000 our princeton professor probably makes that in a week okay they don't they don't don't they don't care what they think at princeton can you answer that for me guys i can't answer how much it's going to cost but i can tell you that um just last year alone china in the ev market subsidized it by 12.4 billion and that's their annual spend it's more than even with our our in our best year it's more than two3 of the united states great but let me ask you a question how much would cost china to become carbon neutral by 2050 i am very concerned well they won't um but i'm i'm more concerned about the the risk to the us economy of losing the auto manufacturing cost do you know see nobody talks about the cost i'll tell you how much it'll cost them it'll cost them a trillion dollars a year starting today to be carbon neutral by 2050 you know how much it'll cost russia 250 billion a year three times what they their defense budget now if you believe that vladimir putin is going to spend $250 billion do for c for to for climate change then you'll never own your own home so we go spend all this money which y'all can't quantify we just keep spending they don't spend the money they're at an an advantage and you know how much world temperatures are lowered none zero zils nada and i can't believe our chairman hadn't cut me off but i am done now's your moment thank youen for your enthusiastic participation in this hearing i just wish we had time to talk about all this i think this is fascinating uh with a couple of uh clarifications um first of all the word mandate has come up repeatedly during this hearing and i just want to make sure everybody understands there is no mandate what there is is a tax incentive and for those of us who believe in traditional economic policy what the tax incentive is there to do is to offset the negative externality of all of the pollution that comes out of an internal combustion engine that society at large pays for but is not baked into the price of the vehicle and you can go all the way to milton friedman to get the economic theory that supports that second evs have been more expensive than internal combustion engines largely because of a market decision by the electronic vehicle innovators to come in at the high end of the market because tesla for instance could compete with maserati and lamborghini on performance and so of course they came in at the high end of the market market particularly when you're starting with small initial manufacturing runs but as the market has grown costs are now coming down to where it's maybe a, $2,000 difference between the average ev cost and the average internal combustion engine cost just around $50,000 uh in each case um the there are available electronic vehicles that are less expensive than the average internal combust engine now so depending on what you want to choose if you want to go and compete with maseratis you can go to the highend but they're also cheaper than average internal combustion electric vehicle uh options and uh the last thing i'll point out is that while tire emissions are obviously real and tire emissions are greater from an electric vehicle than internal combustion vehicle because they electric vehicle is a heavier because of the battery and b higher performance because it's higher performance so you have more tire wear and that creates some additional measure of tire wear related pollution to complain about that in the context of tailpipe pollution and tailpipe emissions calls to mind the old biblical verse about the moat in your own eye or the moat in your brother's eye compared to the beam in your own eye the beam here is tailpipe emissions which pollute enormously and create massive climate risk and i agree that tire missions need to be dealt with but if you put them to scale and compare their hazard for humankind and for local health there it's moat versus beam so with that let me say that questions for the rec to do by noon tomorrow with signed hard copies delivered to the committee clerk in durksen 624 in particular uh miss gross and dr jenkins if you could even perhaps coordinate on recommendations for us in that peak shaving space however you want to do it is fine but i'd love to get those in and uh we ask that our witnesses respond to those questions within seven days of receipt so that would be within a week if you guys could do that with no further business for the committee the vote on the floor has already begun and our hearing is adjourned thank you",No summary

"If Fed cuts rates in Sept., they will be under enormous pressure to cut again, says Vincent Reinhart",2024-07-31 12:04:51-05:00,3,jI3_fpREtNI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jI3_fpREtNI,"rates, but doesn't expect any  guarantees of a december cut. joining us, vincent reinhart,  former fed official. it's great to have you back. not convinced on september quite y yet. >> i have a pretty high bar to  be convinced. and the main question to ask  yourself is why should the foc  commit to an action in september so far away. they have a couple of employment reports, a couple price prints,  they can get confirmation it's  the appropriate act, or get the  warning that maybe they should  rethink. there's been a couple of times  over this pause in which we've  gotten head fakes. why fall for another one? just wait. >> you do make the point that  the market has been serially  wrong in their view about a rate cutting imminent or close. but would you argue that this  time around, the odds of being  wrong are lower than before? >> i think that's right. i think it's also true that a  stopped clock is right twice  >> so my question, i'm sort of  past september, because it feels like the market is there. even if they zpes a pivot today, that would confirm they're  moving towards a september cut. but then what? how do they telegraph what's  going to come next and what this unusual cutting cycle will look  like? >> i think that's the important  discussion, when thinking about  september, in two ways. first, why i think the bar is a  little higher than you do,  sarah, and that is, if you cut  rates in september, you're going to be under enormous pressure to cut them again and again and  again. if you think it's appropriate  only to say trim the federal  funds rate every quarter, the  earlier you start, the more  pressure it's going to be to  deviate from that path. the second part of it is that  september is that september  action, how it's couched, will  tell us how much is due for the  rest of the year. i think that the fmoc still  views its task as re-aligning  the nominal funds rate to the  lower inflation environment, not what it is a tenth or two each  month, but rather, the fact that inflation is a lot low","Category: Macro

pod from cnbc we're bringing you the best of squawk in paris for the 2024 olympics this episode is all about hosting the games my money is tonight will be the highest ratings of of the whole thing it's nbc universal's 18th olympics ratings energy and performance are all sky high brian roberts ceo and chairman of our parent company comcast sits down at our set in paris it's one of the proudest moments i think since we've owned nbc universal the olympics really done perfectly and comcast president michael kavanaugh all these people are going for gold medals and it doesn't matter the sport if you know the story and we so good at storytelling you get into anything and a look ahead to the next games with casey waserman chair of la28 which is hosting the 2028 summer olympics in california we're not building any permanent venues our budget $6.8 billion and so from a sustainability standpoint when you don't have to build anything you start in a pretty good place plus on guard joe becky and andrew take a literal swing at fencing but don't worry for the rest of the games they're sticking to the stance that would be my event the first 30 seconds of the floor joe was doing from his se doing from his seat i'm cnvc producer cameron ca podcasting from new york it's wednesday july 31st 2024 this is going to be fun i i hope our squawk pod from the paris olympics begins right now good morning everybody and welcome to squawkbox right here on cnbc we are live from the olympic games in paris i'm becky quick along with joe kernin and andrew ross sorin and it is day five of the olympic games yeah the action here has been amazing there haven't been any disappointments just in terms of how exciting this has been we were just talking about the olympics the three of us were at the gymnastics team final last night we got to watch the us team bring home the gold the us had the highest score on every apparatus simone biles now has eight olympic medals that is the most ever by a us gymnast pasting shannon miller italy took silver and brazil took bronze and this was phenomenal i mean it was it was electric to actually be able to watch on every event as a result you saw all eight teams 24 gymnasts every one of these apparatuses and you can really see when you're watching all of them the difference uh just in terms of the quality and the caliber of how strong these gymnasts are the balance beam looked even narrower in person which made me more nervous than i normally like the width of your foot it's like the width of your foot and they do one like in like they get so much air and so how nervous were you though none at the end i was nervous then at the end i was nervous then was like there by herself wasn't yeah everything else wrapped up first she was the final competitor final event on the floor and um it it seemed perfect it was very quiet as people were watching her huge cheers as she landed the floor is a good place i would not like for her for her for me as i said i that would be my my event the first 30 seconds of the floor joe was doing from his doing from a seat how long right to where i get to where i'm going to run and then you stop no then i'm it's the same for all but if you could but even for the these unbelievable um um athletes i think to end on the floor is better than on the floor exercise that's better than ending on the balance beam isn't it but they're professional with everything but i myself with all that room if i did a somersault let's say i think i could do that i might pull that off somersault i might be able to pull that off but then do you think you could do a cartwheel no could you i never i have never been able to do a cartwheel oh yeah i can do a roundoff cartwheel i used to stick to as a kid me as a child i think i could i was bank but now i could no well if you are are wondering just how difficult and how dangerous this is this picture that's going viral this is from the brazilian gymnast plaia saa she basically competed with the black eye yesterday after she suffered a hard fall during the warm-ups for the uneven bars we were sitting right in front of her i watched her fall and smack herself and then writhing in the floor this was just minutes before she had to get up and do her competition on those uneven bars and she did it this is what these olympic athletes have i mean you would think that would be game over at least for watching she got a 1366 on that event even right after sheed and they they came in italy came back italy and brazil i think both came back right  a couple of the rotations you know at home it's you know usa us that's what you see on tv everybody was there everybody was there but here it's it's france i mean i went to a taekwan thing all anybody wanted was france to win swimming everybody wants france to me there were some some loud brazilians right it was good it's kind of cold it is and there are so many events that are taking place here from the gymn gymnastics arena to the rugby pitch it was a stunning finish as the us women's rugby sevens team pulled off a comeback with just seconds left to win the bronze this is the team's very first medal ever also the us men's soccer team clinching a spot in the quarterfinals they beat guinea 3 to nothing guess what this is the team's best run since the sydney games back in 2000 and they haven't won a medal since a silver medal that was won back in 1904 124 years ago breaking overnight we should tell you uh aas leader was assassinated in teran this after attending the inauguration of the country's new president hamas saying an israeli air strike killing the group's top leader iran's supreme leader vowing revenge on israel for that assassination the news coming just hours after israel said it had assassinated a senior hezbollah commander in beirut and now questions about how and whether all of this is going to escalate in new ways crude prices have moved higher on the back of that news you're looking at wti now at 76 uh 70 uh this hamas leader had uh been living uh in qatar and had been one of the the people that was responsible for what are these stalled um uh ceasing of of of of of arms back and forth but we'll see whether you know what happens now once now that he's been removed removed exactly uh also not trying not shedding a here at this point no i i know but it's going to the question is does this escalate does this escalate now and does what happens to the ceasefire from where where it happened tensions have been so high there have been so many arms right at the each others and there have been concerns about a misstep that would lead into a big escalation people wondering if this is that and interestingly the spokespeople uh spokesman for the israeli military not commenting on this right and this is going to be fun i i hope um we had we had the opportunity uh to visit the team usa training facility it was on the outskirts of paris and it was to grab a sword fencing is a fastest growing olympic and par olympic sport and usa fencing has added more than 10,000 youth members in the last 8 years that's a 68% increase it's a combat sport it has several variations if you don't know there's foil and epi both use lightweight swords with blunted ends and the objective is to touch your opponent in the designated attack area now with the tip of the blade to score a point uh and saber which we tried out that employs a wider blade and we were shown swordsmanship by two me members of team usa foil fencer miles chamy watson the first american man to win an individual fencing gold at a world championship uh and he is also a model who partners with brands like red bull and tinder we had a lot in common uh except the well the athlete and the male model model model part other than that the height uh but actually i'm there may have been nothing in common and saber f from maya chamberlain a first time olympian and three time ncaa all am here it is oh boy here we go i got you got a my arm you guys actually look really good you guys the ph actually looks very nice okay so do you guys want to like rate us here rank us 10 out of 10 i like the action i like the energy really mhm it's on a curve it's on a big curve clearly you took the average you know no it honestly it was good it's not an easy sport to get into and like be thrown into it so you did good so when you are fencing a competitor how often are they like your best friends and how often do you really want to eat them on the trip is that why arst i hate them all you hate them all even my roommate one my best friends i want to kill him on the trip and afterwards love you kind of like our show like the show exact exactly in maya u chamberlain she competes in women's team saber uh august 3rd miles chamley watson competes august 4th and we'll probably never do it again and i i think we could get better than than what we were would you like the practice i think we can practice in the city there's i think we could get would you like to trying club in new york city we could practice after after the show every you like to try the other style so when i was a kid the i did the i i i fenced with the foil with the foil you didn't disclose that you've had experience fencing as a younger as a younger man ringer as a young we should say look miles and maya each had their own really cool individual stories for how they got into these sports miles got in trouble as a kid in school and this was his punishment he had to choose a sport to pick up bad mitton maybe fencing he liked the idea of a sword so he took fening got great at it look at his knuckles every one of his fingers have been broken huge knuck knuckles maya got into this because she was at a birthday party and she really loved fencing from star wars and from pirates of the caribbean so she picked it up and ram with it they were amazing they were excellent coaches and we appreciate their time we're rooting for them coming up in just a few days now is a really good time to remind you to follow us on x at squawk cnbc you can catch a lot more of our olympics coverage including some videos and some gifts gifs of those fencing moves on the east here on squawk pod after this break we're talking hosting the olympics with casey werman chair of la28 the private group in charge of the 2028 la olympics when we move into the village the ucla there are more students living in ucla's olympic village during a school year then we will have athletes so the first time we operate is not when the world is watching how socal is getting ready right after this welcome back to pod up and andrew q you're watching squawkbox right here on cnbc i'm andrew r sorin along with joe kernin and becky quick and we've got the octa triumph in the background along with the eiffel tower in just four years from now the summer olympics will be held back in the united states this time in los angeles and this time with the addition of new sporting events including cricket and flag football and joining us right now with a preview of what to come in 2028 the man uh who has put it all together casey werman werman chairman and ceo he is the chairman of la 2028 the group in charge of the 2028 olympic games it's nice to see you you already you already got t-shirts made i got at least at least one so you're here the moment is almost upon you upon us at the end of this games in just about a week and a half uh the torch will start moving towards la what what are you learning while you're here well i think one of the unique things about the olympics is you intellectually understand the scale of it but until you see and feel the scale of it it's hard to comprehend so for us it's a lot of watching and seeing how these things all operate cuz we are essentially producing 72 world championships in 17 days in los angeles uh and so to to understand all the complexity that comes with that transportation security operations back aous restocking facilities all these things you never really think about at that scale we need to see it real okay so the ratings for this are skyhigh you're going to want the ratings for yours to be what are you learning what's working and to be honest maybe what's not working is there something that you've learned um look what's working here is they did a great job of creating iconic venues and having full venues and so there's a lot to learn from how they did that how they managed those processes and the results look what's not working frankly most of it is behind the scenes and non-consequential at scale um but one of the things did did we have the advantage of all our venues operate for the use we will use them essentially in 2028 so when we move into the village and ucla there are more students living at ucla's olympic village during a school year then we will have athletes and they feed them and they house them and they do laundry and food and all those things so the first time we operate is not when the world is watching so this olympics as you know is they're trying to make it more sustainable as you are not building you know a million new buildings in this case i think only building two frankly what are you guys going to be doing and how much is it ultimately going to cost this olympics looks like it's going to cost something on the order of about $10 billion when everything's done so all olympics except la have two budgets they have a capital budget which is the build the couple buildings they did build and a lot of the infrastructure and the billion and a half for the sen and all those things and they have an operating budget uh we have one cuz we're not building any permanent venues our budget is $6.8 billion um and so from a sustainability standpoint when you don't have to build anything you start in a pretty good place but that's just sort of the table stakes and so how do we leave la better than when we found it in every way cuz we're just there for 17 days are you studying 84 i i'll just let you know that i was there living there and there was a great amount of fear in trepidation and ub broth is still legendary for how how smoothly the traffic and everything else went are you are you i talked to peter 3 days before i came over uh i was there i was 10 uh and it was maybe the best la had ever been to that point and it changed our city in manyways and i think a lot of the things they did we will repeat and we have a lot more to do uh in terms of the transportation fa got some mass transit there highway some new highway what do you do about traffic well by the way these guys have dealt with traffic by shutting all the roads down we won't shut the roads down but the truth is unlike a normal sporting event you put everybody in buses or in organized public transportation you put all those for vehicles in special bic lanes and of all the things we worry about traffic is not at the top of the list i mean people joke as you know jo '84 there was no traffic i mean you could have run down the not got hit by a car i will say i i mean i i love being in paris for this it's been fantastic as a visitor i've never been thrilled with the idea of having the olympics in new york city as somebody who has to work there that would be a different thing but now with remote work i mean some things they did in ' 84 and there were no truck deliveries except between midn 5:00 a.m. wow that it's basically like get out this is for a special occasion get out we're going to make the city much better and leave it better than we can correct and as i i think you can for any any problem you can solve for 17 days that doesn't mean you can fix it forever but we can change things for 17 days and now with things like remote work is there a different set of sponsors that you're looking at lvmh obviously this is their home they're a huge sponsor of this olympics it'll be interesting to see whether they continue as as sponsors i don't know what you think about that but are there others i mean does disney all of a sudden say to themselves you know we're in la hollywood this is our this is our land we're we're going to spons this are there companies that historically have not played in this space that you think become sponsors definitely i mean look disney obviously we have to be respectful our relationship with your boss in many ways and the olympic relationship that comcast nbc have but people forget in 1984 disney imagineering actually designed the mascot sam the eagle was designed by disney so there's lots of opportunities to bring in whether mattel the biggest toy company is based in la there's a whole group of people that want sort of what california is and brees and what los angeles has become for culture that want to conect with us would you keep surfing in tahiti or zuma zuma dude can you do it right malibu they're doing it in malibu no no we're going to do it well we've got a couple choices hermosa beach or trestles um the waves aren't great in southern california this summer um in tahiti and i i volunteer and joe i won't make any jokes about american foreign policy but if we take over tahiti i guess i could do it in french poesia what um how spread out do you think you're going to going to do it cuz this the one thing about this olympics is you know basketball ball is 2 and 1/2 hours away you know equestrians at versa which is an unbelievable place but it takes a while to get to even even just getting from one event to another that's in paris is you can't really do more than one or two sports in a de so we have a different model about 85% of our events are within 30 km of each other from long beach uh to the valley and and it's a pretty tight radius with lots of events in concentrated locations and then we will have other events in other places just like they have at every games people don't pay attention but you know there's no sailing in paris so sailing is in marseilles we can sail in long beach so that's an advantage we're going to do softball and canoe kayak in oklahoma city um so we're going to take advantage of all the best things cuz those are the things that 40 years ago people got in trouble building those venues right and the ioc now understands they got to be much more flexible about the security perimeter i mean and also i mean here they have to do security at each venue it's such a it's such a but if you can do it in one or two places it changes the whole economics up i imagine it does it's the one thing the federal government is responsible for and delivers uh we have our national special security exemption 3 years earlier than any event in the history of america it it points to the scale and the complexity of this and we are well deep into our planning for that casey werman we wish you a lot of luck becky thank you app she got the hat got the hat aahoo north shore aahoo except except only only in the winter are there waves in the northshore oh really see see only a surfer would appreciate it thanks guys will be next coming up on pod the broadcasting hosts of the olympics this year the leaders of nbc universal's parent company comcast on the ratings the golds and the spirit of the games chairman and ceo brian roberts you reimagine our society it's the whole world coming together putting their arms down trying to celebrate the incredible personal achievements team achievements and comcast president mike kavanaugh more and more sports are going to be streamed and available just looking at the ability more camera angles alternative telecast even if it's not the olympics but the olympics really shows you what's possible you know streaming sports that big interview right after this you're listening to squawk pod from cnbc with joe keran becky quick and andrew rosarin here's joe the 2024 paris uh games are nbc's 18th olympics they're off to a solid start to say the least for the company according to neelon and adobe analytics friday's opening ceremony drew 28.6 million viewers on nbc and peacock that's more than uh 10 million above the opening of the last summer uh games in tokyo on sunday more than 41 million people watch the athletes compete here now on our paris set brian roberts chairman and ceo of comcast the parent of nbc universal and nbc and mike kavanaugh comcast president they give medals out here as you guys know but i'm thinking trophies and i'm thinking trophy properties this is is there anything close to this brian as far as a there's nothing it's this is just magnificent and what a guys it's not bad here it's like two weeks of of having a super bowl almost in terms of but also in terms of how hard it is to do well so it's definitely um unique it's one of the proudest moments i think since we've owned nbc universal the olympics really done perfectly you reimagine our society it's the whole world coming together putting their arms down trying to celebrate the incredible personal achievements team achievements and french government president mcon they welcomed this whole operation that we have 3,000 people working to bring this broadcast peacock xinity nbc all working together um and then when it works and you have innovation like gold zone or here here with that noise in the background kn you're in a real life we don't hear it anymore um and and the eiffel tower and surfing from tahiti i i can't think of anything makes me prouder and uh the results so far are every reason we do this it helps peacock helps nbc the advertisers and our partners and uh mike and his team have have are just doing a great job the way it's covered keeps changing and now you can see basically everything you want however you want to see but the the the the feeling and the spirit of of human endeavor is it's been around for like this for 100 years we felt that last right last night mike we talked lot for brazil they were behind us where like y brail we talked about it a lot in the leadup i mean how important the the olympics movement is and our small piece of it so it's obviously great that the ratings are strong uh and that bodess really well for looking ahead to los angeles clearly and then beyond but i think it's it celebrates you know competition it's celebrates a lot of the great virtues i'm being at a couple of the venues and just watching you know competitors you know uh acknowledging each other stepping up to the podiums from countries that are at odds with each other it's you know we all had it growing up it much more of the you know what the olympic spirit was all about so being part of recharging it which clearly these games are doing is such a great thing for our compan though i mean part of it is the backdrop but there's something else going on because you can go and look at you know where we were in rio or pyang chang obviously tokyo was tough given the pandemic but what do you think it is about this and this moment well well first of all let's start with it's paris and as the most coveted city in the world to come visit and one of the things that our team developed was let's infuse that sense of everybody wants to be here right now so whether it's some of the social media whether it's some of the celebrities uh snoop dog and and the talent and just uh movie stars and just this is the place to be right now for the next two weeks um i think the team and the spirit of our usa country wanting to pull together at a time when we've been pulled apart is really important and then that opening ceremony just captured it the the imagination of coming down the scent coming in by boat we've never seen anything like that before and um that's what makes the olympics the olympics and uh as mike said doing it unlike anybody else uh the french my hats off on them they're doing it fabulous job remember i think if i could add jo the the to your you know where you started the question it's our company you know that what we believe is the strategy for us in a world that's changing in media marrying nbc broadcast mike tqo prime time you know while it's you know late prime time and a lot has happened there's been tremendous viewing all through the day cuz we've got so many hours available on uh traditional linear television across all of our properties all day long on mvc and then at pe on peacock on the other side both sides both linear and streaming and on the streaming side you know you got 7,000 hours you can see everything and we've got gold zone now which has been a viral hit you know uh back in the states of people you know we've had 10 gr 10 boxes up on the screen and they're doing the whip around and getting jazzed about really anything olympics all these people are going for gold medals and it doesn't matter the sport if you know the story and we do such good at story so good at storytelling you get into anything but mike i think that's a big part of the story and what we're seeing kind of developed from here a lot of the guests that we've had this week have been people like alexis ohanian who's trying to lift up women's track and field and the same story from michael johnson just this idea that these are incredible sports that get ignored in between but what's happening is as you have all the streaming things taking off people are seeing this is a new market a new way to how about that rugby finish last yesterday i know it looked like i returning foot i didn't know that ever happen epic kind of moment it's exactly to your becky that maybe we haven't fallen in love with that sport all the time but suddenly you do and of course simone biles and the comeback story u how how the redemption and the the spirit and it's fantastic you remember when you were negotiating to get the long-term deal and and content for sports and now we know about nba and we know about what what a singular thing can do for peacock 38% above last year because you had to get i mean these properties are so valuable do you look back on that deal we got for the we i mean i work here but do you look back on that we all shared that how did that happen how did we get that deal for that price and we were just so in belief that the olympics mattered and we did they one of the things they do is let you have all technologies so we looked at i always looked at as our r&d laboratory we started with every athlete in every sport but it didn't quite work last time and the peacock team has done a fabulous job of making that work the exfinity team with the voice remote and the integration being so simple the sign up so there's a lot behind the picture quality on usa we have a whole new version of high def tv we're trying out which improves the quality um but that moment back then was existential when we made the deal with the international olympic committee they've done a great job being partners with us america is a really important part of the olympic movement the nbc brand helped back then cu they got less m still and it still does we met with them the other day and they're very proud of what the coverage and the emotion that we bring to the broadcast and and then the whole company cnbc here and nbc news and leester and so again i just echo could there be a prouder moment in our company and then to have it work this well beyond our highest expectations right and then paris and then all paris way which raises the question about just repeating this because you have milan coming up next then you got la then after that you're going uh back i think to the french alps right so it gets i mean there's sort of a momentum on now the bar is set for a spectacular backdrop here so we got all our great creators in in hollywood so when it comes to la imagine what la is going to be able to do to create their version of an open c ceremony to stand up to what paris d did i think we'll be up for it but it's going to be fun to fun to watch it happen the uh i wish it solved all of our problems for media though and i'm not saying we have problems but it is a daunting business that we're in right now like the the most recent report of brian there's there's bright spots across the board some some maybe i mean studios you can't count on you know you got comps from last year you can't count on the same movies every year obviously theme parks that always comes back maybe there you know was so hot after the pandemic that you can't expect that to to keep up but where do we find growth from here on out well let me start i think mike uh feel free to to partner on this but uh i think we have seen this transition in the business coming so let's start with our broadband business we have 32 million broadbands i think we're in an enviable position we have more fiber more connections and yes now more competition but we're surviving that in a way where we're the bet we're making is that people will use broadband more and more so just take these olympics all the streaming we're talking about all that volume is all requires you to have a great broadband connection double digit growth in bits per home every month and 70% of those bits are streamed entertainment and as you now start to see sports move and more and more sports are going to be streamed and available just looking at the ability more camera angles alternative telecasting even if it's not the olympics but the olympics really shows you what's possible you know streaming sports that's going to be fantastic for our highquality broadband business then go on to your favorite nbc universal what's happening with with media well we've added more customers in peacock than we've people have cord cut in the last 12 months the last 24 months we we have a plan to make it to the other side the digital side and so and then being sport in the as a central one of the reasons the nba makes so much sense for us and i believe we got the best package because we have the most regular season games and the most playoff games and if you're looking for continuity when you buy a streaming service you want to have the nfl on sunday night now you have the nba the next quarter on sunday then you go into an olympics or a premier league or a tour to france or then you go to college football and we have and on and on and on so it keeps them from ever dropping and then in between you're watching jurassic and you're watching snl and poker face and very soon well we have that too and then we have coming out day of the jackal we have wicked we have more from chris mel and dandre how about the minions in the opening ceremony they were fantastic so the company rit large it starts with broadband works into content with a hybrid streaming between nbc and peacock working so well together and then as you mentioned studios will go up and down but we have a great team great forecast and theme parks what we would say is we did pull forward demand but we'll be having a set like this at epic universe in orlando hopefully next year and it will speak for itself with harry potter to we'll even have air conditioning for you guys um nba question barry diller was sitting where you were last week and he uh effectively made the argument he thinks that there's going to be some kind of settlement made with warner brothers and tnt and that possibly they come back to everybody and say look we got to actually create a fourth package we're going to have to like recar all this up what do you think i think the nba is super thorough in how they do their work we've been very impressed um with everything adam silver has organized we're excited about our world uh uh stay tuned but i i i i'm pretty confident that we'll have our package moving along here in a year from now we wish it was a year sooner uh the the games we just had that nb the the usa basketball game had a rating almost equivalent with the nba finals just their first i said i think tonight the south sudan game may actually be one of our rating winners like big time little little payback for that scare what do you guys do while you're here do you get to get out and see the games yet is this more about business and checking in to see what things are doing a little bit of all the above spent a lot of time with the international olympic committee the us olympic committee uh getting ready for the la uh gam so a good amount of business but then have had some fun you know what i got to see uh the women's gymnastics last night so great moment for the us seeing the flag go up here in the national anthem will be a big memory um being at the beach volleyball the other night one of the best venues in sports the electricity of the environment and then i i i got to see a little bit of nadal jokovic so you know hopefully not his last but maybe mike's having too much fun having a lot of fun how about you brian well i'm my family's coming over in a few days and and we're going to go out then and really see a lot of sporting events um i came over several times before and again i just can't say enough wonderful things about our team has said no country has ever been quite as organized as france has been and paris and president mcon and what he's done um my we're so the operation's running smoothly we got a long way to go and i can't wait to be part of it we you wish everything was i'm thinking about sports in the nba and and how excited i am to i i wasn't before betting and i always say people get tired of me talking about it but i watch all the nba games now because i have a stake and and it's going to go state to state eventually everybody's going to have it and i can't maybe i'll bet on rugby like you said i mean sports is is so incredibly valuable especially when you have $5 on on a game it's well i think what you're seeing with peacock having every sporting event there and you're in control as a viewer or you can sit back on nbc and just have the traditional broadcast we're trying to appeal to every demographic every taste that's only going to get better and better technology uh makes it so seamless this was a milestone moment for our company and i'm so proud we delivered that playoff game uh with kansas city was the largest streamed event in history that's what this is now becoming uh and so what imagins in the future whether it's uh beding or whether it's camera angles or whether it's higher de quality or more choices we want to be the company to bring you that are you do you want to buy something are you jonesing to do anything like that dude no i'm not because and i said this on the earnings call that we have the making of a great company so we'd rather invest in something is purely positive such as the mba big investment we think we have a great partnership in the making we're excited about where they're taking the sport um all the other things out there there's some good and some negatives and this is just good so i think that's the trajectory we hope to stay on do you think and just to emphasize that i mean we got strong businesses across the board each one of our businesses is in its own strong position making money there's no piece of our business that we would say we're a lagered in and the we push our teams to say where can we grow where where should we invest and we put a tremendous amount of money back into our own business so we're going to add you know a million passings in the cable business this year you know more footprint growth we're driving the business services business we're driving the wireless business all on the on the uh uh cable side of the business and an nbc you know christopher nolan coming over to our studio thanks to you know the great work by the team there is it's a way to grow it's get a great director like and lo and behold you end up with a pile of uh oscars um going after the nba there'll be more and then putting you know quite a few billions of dollars into uh into epic universe in florida that's the better that and returning capital to our shareholders has been a good formula for us and it starts with having great businesses that you can make better and invest in organically and so when we look around at the chess board that everybody wants to ask us about inheriting a lot of other people's problems is it's a tough way to do it versus just go build build around the great assets we already have well i was going to ask you about those problems though do you expect there to be more maybe we maybe we meaning nbc you comcast won't be part of it but do you expect there to be a lot more consolidation or do you think that actually there given the regulatory environment there won't be and by the way maybe some of these companies are going to continue to have problems at which point maybe there's an opportunity in the future you know you can't control those kind of things so what you do is what mike just said very articulately play your own game and we just saw with paramount you know a new new somebody came in and said we think there's a a better way and so we wish them well and met david ellison once or twice and you know these are very smart capable people so i'm maybe consolidation you could say you hope there's consolidation but that but on the other hand new energy new thinking that's also good so we can't control any of that what we can do is try to build a company with six growth tracks and several businesses in transition have the strong balance sheet return capital to shareholders and be consistent i would say if you've said pick a word that has defined us for a long time it's trying to being consistent and patient and try to build a very very special and unique company when it all comes together a moment like this it's a chance to celebrate you know our our viewers are going to be watching j pal later today and his decision on interest rates i i know fundamentally you guys are just playing your own game and doing those things but what do you look at when you look at the interest rate environment what that might mean i think it's more about what the what's happening with the consumer you saw we had a little softness in parks and i read some other companies results maybe there's a little i mean finding the right balance between getting inflation under control and keeping the economy going i think they've done the fed's done a good job personally and i think we're getting closer to the time we we'll likely see some moves if the regulatory hurdles were gone something changes i don't know what and you could do whatever you wanted there's nothing you would do right this minute that that hasn't impeded our thinking that's not what it is it's you're right other compan i mean i think about the mergers and you know the first two years you're paying down debt trying to somehow you know hope that eventually it's going to pay off but there's no guarantee i love our company and the team that we've assembled and we've got a plan and we're going to go out and execute we have squawk box you got squa box what else do you need um and it's i mean we could if you want we'll go to 9:00 i mean if that's you know you tell us we're out of here thank you for being here thank you guys thanks for all you're doing thanks for having it's fant co we've got a huge uh lineup today of big events coming up right here in paris let's tell you what's on deck we got five swimming finals among the races to watch katie lei is going to be trying to defend her 1500 meter gold triathletes swimming on this send today this after last minute testing showing the river is safe some previous tests had failed for bacterial contamination so there was a little bit of a debate here in paris about what would happen and then this evening it's going to be big the us men's basketball team facing south sudan earlier this month the two faced off in an exhibition game in london and to be honest it was not pretty for the american team of nba stars they eventually did win but only by literally a point they trailed by as many as 16 at one point steph curry said the us won't underestimate south sudan today we had talked just last week about this i mean this is ath sudan is a country that's only been around since 2011 they have no nba players on the team their biggest star is a 17-year-old who's on his way to duke from this um they really caught the us team off guard but part of well you if you believe grant hill he said look it's an exhibition game yeah nobody wants to get hurt question is whether they play it like as we've talked about the nba allstar game lebron stepped it up at the end though he really tonight's tonight though so we will see but there's a reason you play the games or else it'd be like here's your medal so i mean anything it is possible that why you'd want to see it right the ball has to go through the hoop many and teams get cold and who knows but my money would be if i was a betting man okay so my money is by the way the ratings have been skyh high for these olypic games but i will also say my money is tonight will be the highest ratings of uh tonight with the nba of the whole thing gymnastics too women's gymnastics tonight the nba i'm going with nba tonight not it's not the nba we can't call it the nba we call it basketball dream no it is a version of the nba of sorts right that's it for this episode of squawk pod thank you for tuning in there's more squawking at the olympics to be had all you have to do to catch it is follow squawk pod wherever you're

Squawk Pod: Social Media at the Olympics: Evan Spiegel & Alexis Ohanian - 07/31/24 | Audio Only,2024-07-31 13:01:12-05:00,25,8_CkUe6c-aw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_CkUe6c-aw,"this is squawk pod from cnbc on today's episode we're bringing you the best of squawk in paris for the 2024 olympics first a conversation with reddit co-founder venture capitalist and investor in women's sports it's alexis ohanian the core phenomenon here probably came from a certain someone i'm married to uh right serena williams is the prototype for you can show women's sports is and can be and should be on the same level as men's why he's been invested in women's sports for years you look at those viewer numbers even to this day more americans watch the us open final for the women than the men ohanian's newest venture in track plus being a girl dad in the olympic village and how social media is pushing athletes to new heights in the attention economy we are fighting tooth and nail on social media to get someone to pay attention and you look at follower accounts and it tells you the story of why women athletes are so compelling then how fans are using social media at the olympics with snap ceo evans bagel he's rolled out ar features in the official olympics app it's a really fun fan experience you can think of it as the modern version of the kiss camp and what he envisions for the 2028 olympics fan experience what we've seen at snapchat is in fact people would rather be present in the real world and we think that means that people want to see the world through a lens rather than a screen i'm cnbc producer cameron costa podcasting from new york and squawk pod from the 2024 olympics begins right after this you're listening to squawk pod with joe kernan becky quick and andrew ross organ here's becky now for a look at investing in women's sports the paris games and much more we've got alexis ohanian he's venture capitalist co-founder and former executive chairman of reddit he's of course also the founder of 776 and alexis we got to back this up instead of jumping right in with what your newest news is and track and field we'll talk about that in a minute but i really want to back this up because i think you're a visionary when it comes to seeing the absolute power and strength of women's sports you've been an advocate for a very long time you've been putting money behind those bets for a very long time and now the rest of the world is starting to catch up with you why don't we talk about what you saw and how like i guess the obvious question is how did you know women's sports was going to be big well look 2019 i just rage tweeted uh because the women's world cup was coming on deck and i it made no sense to me that a team could be worth only a few million dollars when the sport was garnering international attention every four years how could you keep the momentum going the answer you know was my initial investment in angel city which obviously most recently now has announced a large round of funding from bob and willow um bob iger and yes uh which we're obviously excited about but the the the core phenomenon here probably came from a certain someone i'm married to uh right serena williams is the prototype for how you can show women's sports is and can be and should be on the same level as men's cuz you look at those viewer numbers even to this day more americans watch the us open final for the women than the men and that's the legacy the william sisters billy chen king and everyone else and so it takes investment it takes thinking about it from first principles not treating it just like uh the men's version of the sport but really understanding why do people love these athletes how to support them and how to build but i think one of the huge parts of this is you put your entrepreneurial cap on and you look at things differently i think part of it has to be the valuation picture because men's sports have been so richly valued you're looking at things that are undervalued at that point and then you shake things up a bit you make it more interesting more exciting you change things what i i we can talk about what you're doing in track maybe that's a good way of kind of going at it for sure well look it cost a million to buy a franchise the nwsl in 2019 most recently a a a team paid $53 million so you can see that increase over just the last four years part of the understanding was when folks fill an arena and we get 22,000 max capacity regularly for angel city they're doing it with a different why in women's sports they want to see greatness they want to see excellence but it's tied into a cultural trend that you'll more likely see online than you will through traditional media no offense and that was our thinking with women's track i saw the world pretty much the same way in 19 where here is this sport we're all going to be paying so much attention to for these olympics what are they doing the rest of the time and what i came to find out was you know there was a huge opportunity to invest there was a huge opportunity to create the largest prize in the history of track over half million dollars and and create something that would be a cultural event as much as it was sporting can i ask a question why did you think the inflection point was now and the reason i asked that is you know you go back in time when the wnba began and we would talk a lot about how we were at this inflection point and this something was about to happen and then in truth it didn't happen and so what is it about now that has shifted this whole dynamic well you know the reddit guy is going to tell you it's social media and and i was calling this shot three or four years ago check the tweets uh it was obvious even during that wait room scandal at the ncaa tournament when the women were given this like a a pitts in in support versus the men they couldn't even say uh final four back then the women on social media the individual accounts had far more followers than the top men in college basketball that was obvious three or four years ago that is where attention is and then obviously you get superstars like kaitlin clark angel ree to really level up the attention but but in the attention economy we are fighting tooth and nail on social media to get someone to pay attention and you look at follower accounts and it tells you the story of why women athletes are so compelling i i think that's a huge part of it though you're you're very smart about finding superstars building characters that people want to follow and go along with and you use business principles in this which is the incentive structure you pay everybody who's going to show up at this track me yes and and nothing about this is charity nor should it be charity and that i think was one of the things maybe the mindset has held back women's sports in the past this is about excellence about celebrating it not only is it about record-breaking prize uh but it's also all of the revenue we generate from athlos new york 10% of it will get pulled and distributed evenly to all 36 of the women who show up we're finding ways to align incentives uh and this is just step one uh but we wanted to do something that reminded people even after the olympics $60,000 for the first place that's right second like i mean those are so that's some big money well well keep in mind the top top prize at the end of a normal professional season in this sport is $30,000 so i wasn't doing anything terribly clever just doubling the top prize in in the sport when you think about the audience for women's sports broadly m how much does it need to come from women how much do you think it needs to come from men this has been a big topic of conversation cuz you look at know the stands at an nfl game i think it's about 7030 uh basketball i think is actually uh potentially even more uh across the country this is in the us this is m so how much of this when you look at who's going to be sitting in the stands for a women's game how much of it is more women in those stands and how much of it is more men in those stands one of the things that'll surprise you potentially is even in angel city we see actually a pretty great representation not only of men and women sort of close pretty close to 50/50 actually but also spread across demographic spread across income levels and and it's really a reflection of los angeles and i think women sports broadly yes there is an entry point for women who are finding more and more interest in sports broadley because more and more content is actually being created around it but i also think there are plenty of men and i know the girl dad thing comes up often with me obviously have two daughters but there are plenty of men who love sports who are now finding ways to tune in because they weren't accessible before and finding something that they really love and they're getting to spend time with their kids boys and girls and they're realizing i love sports for the stories for the excellence for the athleticism and the women's game has it too and so i think you'll see more and more folks showing up in these stands whether it's for athlos or for other events that are actually represent the whole population men and women and children how much of it is because of the the streaming aspect of things right now and how much money is there there's a real demand for content and and instantaneous with with sports i think what look what that social media wave has shown is that folks have very short attention spans and you have to compete with it no matter who you are and so the streamers are realizing okay the appointment television that is left it's sports you have to must see it and and this is an opportunity for the women's game to get revalued and the wnba's recent media deal is a great example of that alexis you revealed recently that you tested positive for limes disease how you doing i'm doing great i look thank god uh i got the antibiotics in me early so i'm i'm i'm a trooper i think got a couple days left but we're good but i do i tweet probably a little too much uh but one of the things one of the things i really want to share especially with with other guys if you're like me you don't spend much time thinking about your health then you get a couple kids and you start realizing hey i got to make some serious changes i got to get real about it uh so yeah did a whole battery of blood work and thankfully got caught so we're good what's been your favorite part of the olympic so far you know actually just being able to see olympia walking around the olympic village trading pins taking all the miles's pins sorry miles miles chy watson we were with them yesterday defenser and he said your daughter stole all his ps i look she's an ambitious young lady and i'm i'm there to support it uh but to see her running around to to really feel like she gets to experience this thing that i mean i feel privileged to be there i'm definitely not an olympian she's got the name and obviously the lineage uh but it's awesome to see how much watch uh you know if my wife's not in it i'm not paying too much attention to it when there's really good competition obviously cheering on coco we love us some coco um but i don't know i we saw swimming last night wahooa uh and i'm looking forward to gymnastics tomorrow but we'll see i got to i got to work here too so i'm balancing it all out well alexis thank you for working with us we appreciate it and we'll see you a little later and i want to make sure to personally invite you all the athlos uh we also not only have the fastest september 26th in new york not only the fastest women of the world largest prize but also meg the stallion is performing so if the super bowl got rihanna the fastest women deserve me i know you're make the stallion fan j i'll be there know it i knew my kids are no i'll come that's a genuine no my da my daughter is an all-american and heck yes in the 800 and the 1500 all right she'll be running in it one day too okay thanks a lot thanks lot is a little right isn't she thean i think she leans a little right i mean i i think she is as long as she shows up rings that that hot girl an i thought that's why you said that i figured you were sp yeah i am she leaves a little okay che will be next up next on squawk pod another dad in social media and tech snaps ceo evan spiegel and his approach to his own kids and his platform are they on snap are they allowed to be the 13-year-old is allowed to be on snapchat now but we have family center which is a way that you can link your 13-year-olds account uh with your account and you can see you know the friends that they're talking to plus the augmented reality that snap has rolled out at the olympics we've been able to bring our augmented reality tools outside of the snapchat application into the olympics app the official olympics app and into the stadium we'll be right back welcome back to squawk pod from cnbc with joe kernin becky quick and andrew ross soran up and andrew q coco go eliminated in women's tennis singles by cochis uh donna veage straight sets uh and we should mention there was a controversial call uh that's making waves literally as we speak by a chair umpire that had uh goo protesting unsuccessfully and it got it got heated uh to the tournament supervisor coco's metal hopes still alive in the doubles competition but i imagine as people look at uh video of these olympic games today uh shots from this uh from what happened at this tennis match are going to be the thing that folks are going to be talking about you know what went viral yesterday with that that unbelievable shot surfer brazilian surfer gabriel gabriel medina posting uh the highest single wave score in olympic history and captured uh him in the air and it has gone viral there's no plastic anything under him this literally is the photo uh ai didn't do no job no nothing the surfing competition is happening in tahiti now of course that is 10,000 m away from paris but this has gone viral and i believe coko is about to go viral the fight that she just had uh with with um should the umpire she's had a whole bunch of fights with umpires including by the way just in the french open uh a month ago and then if you remember in dubai back in february she got into a tangle with the empire there so it's going to be uh it's going to be interesting she's been standing up for herself uh often times the empire has actually been wrong in terms with some of the calls and in this case she feels uh she was wronged in this call i i just i wonder you know wx worldwide exchange has the word of the day maybe we should do the photo of the day photo of the day well that'll be the photo when maybe we'll get coco with with the umpire that'll be that'll be next photo and one of the reasons we wanted to mention all this virality is because so much of the stuff is showing up on social media and snapchat is here in paris power powering augmented reality experiences at the olympics for the first time ever snapchat cameras are now inside olympic venues i sat down with snapo evan spiegel in an exclusive interview here in paris and i asked him how all this new technology it's like the new kiss cam works here in these stadiums one of the things that's been really exciting this year is that we've been able to bring our augmented reality tools outside of the snapchat application into the olympics app the official olympics app and into the stadium which is so fun for the fan experience okay so for those people who are uninitiated and don't know what we're talking about when you're in this stadium you're going to see what you're going to see all the snapchat ar effects built just for the olympics in 2024 overlaid on the audience and so it's a really fun fan experience you can think of it as the modern version of the kiss cam so you started doing this in the us first we did the it first launched at sofi stadium back i think in 2022 and since then you know we just supported the super bowl and we're delighted to bring it to a ton of stadiums venues all around paris for 2024 um is there a certain sport that you are looking forward to using the lenses on well i um it's more like on the audience i guess well i know it's on the audience but you can also do it on the players if you want to we had not thought of that but i think we should definitely consider it oh you don't do it on the players yourself we haven't typically done it on the players it's been more of like a fan engagement no i know that's in the arena but don't you think that people are using it that way i think it's a great idea yeah we should we should absolutely that um let me ask you just about actually we we keep hearing sirens um and safety and security issues and how snap is playing into that or not in terms of both privacy issues and not and whatnot especially with kids these days yeah absolutely that's that's top of mind for us and it's actually critical to the way that we've built our service from the beginning we've seen that privacy is integral to security so things like having a private friends list for example or only allowing people to communicate with you if you've previously agreed uh to be friends those are the sorts of things that create a safe snapchat experience that's really oriented around friends and family how do you think snap these days compares to the other social medias platforms and do you think of yourself as social media i think we offer social connection without social comparison and that's one of the reasons why people really love snapchat i think people have always felt pressure to be pretty imperfect on social media to only share that 1% of their life that really feels special and worth sharing but the other 99% is frankly more important many times especially in our close friendships and relationships where you know the ups and downs of everyday life and sharing those moments is what bring us closer together okay generational question do you see a the young generation as they're getting older continuing to use snap are you seeing older people i'm by the way finding myself using snap more why because i have 13-year-old boys who use snap and if you want if you want them to respond to you more quickly then uh a text message they will do it on snap how does that work in terms of then trying to keep these generations engaged yeah the snapchat community has really grown with snapchat so now more than 80% of snapchatters are above the age of 18 so we really have seen the snapchat community grow and it is the perfect place for a family uh group chat okay but how do you do it at home how do we do it at home yeah how old are your kids we 13 6 4 and 5 months quite a range all boys it's utter chaos and are they on snap are they allowed to be the 13-year-old is allowed to be on snapchat now but we have family center which is a way that you can link your 13-year-olds account uh with your account and you can see you know the friends that they're talking to and their privacy settings screen time what's your what's the house rule uh you know i think everything in moderation i think the challenge you know with screen time is really when screens start taking away from other important aspects of your life whether you know playing sports or hanging out with friends or of course homework so trying to find the right balance of using screens to connect with people when we're apart while at the same time making sure we have room in our lives to do all the other things that are really do you let the kids use tik tok andor youtube tik tok is not allowed in our household and uh youtube for competitive reasons or national security purposes uh maybe a mixture of about and what about youtube youtube is allowed of course is allowed um on tik tok do you actually have a view on the national security piece of this whole situation i think what's interesting to see is the way that the government has sort of worked to thread the issue obviously it's important that tik tok is in the united states for competitive reasons it helps you know to create a more dynamic you know tech marketplace uh but at the same time i think through this divestment approach they've tried to make sure that you know that foreign uh governments can't influence you know our politics for example or spread misinformation so i think they're trying to thread the needle by making sure the service can continue to benefit americans but at the same time mitigating some of those concerns me when you guys sit around on a monday morning meeting are you planning that there is no tik tok in the future are you planning that tik tok exists as it does today nothing happens or are you planning on some new version of tik tok owned by and controlled by an american company in the future what we're planning on is continuing to grow our community by serving them with the best possible snapchat experience at the core of snapchat is communication with friends and family of course we have a content platform that can be competitive uh you know with video services like tik tok but you don't have a you don't have a take on which of the various things are going to happen it's really hard to say right now i think we'll all have a lot more clarity in the fall as the legal process evolves uh but right now it's it's too hard to say we do have an election coming up what are you doing around either misinformation on the platform around the election or just how do you feel about people using the platform for news around the election one of the things that's always been really important to us is making sure that people using snapchat have access to really high quality news that's why we partner uh with media organizations nbc uh to provide really high quality content and we re vue share with those partners to make sure that they can continue to reinvest in their newsroom and and continue to bring high quality news to our community and that's especially important for young people because a lot of news today is increasingly behind a pay wall which makes it really really hard for young people to access high quality information especially when social media is inundated with misinformation so we built our platform differently we have a closed and moderated content platform we you know work very closely with our publisher partners to bring high quality news uh into the platform and we think all of that supports self-expression which is so fundamental uh to democracy um ai is obviously a huge issue is there any real clever ways that people are using ai on snap yet one of the things that we've been most excited about is the way that our generative ai tools have been adopted by lens developers so generative ai is powering the way that people use lens studio today they can generate new 3d assets on the fly they're even using uh generative ai to build lenses themselves and all of that is really exciting because it lowers the barrier to creativity creation is it changing what you're doing with engineers i'd say engineers are definitely seeing the benefits of being able to use tools like co-pilot to you know improve the velocity of their programming i think that's really exciting if you think about how much software there is in the world if it just gets 5 or 10% easier to build software that's a huge productivity improvement globally okay so we're here in 2024 in paris the next summer games are going to be in your hometown of los angeles how is it going to be different and how is snap going to be be involved in it yeah we're so excited about the games coming to los angeles in fact we're in many ways i'm i'm here to learn and see uh you know all the incredible work that went into making paris 2024 uh possible i know los angeles mayor bass is out uh you know for the opening ceremony to see uh the olympics and all their glory i think what la is going to bring to the table is a lot of creativity the city is very diverse uh you know it's over 10 million people and in many ways it's almost a collection of little cities and the way that i i believe the organizers are thinking about the games are leveraging existing infrastructure in los angeles uh you know spread throughout the city to to bring the games to life well we all just be still using a phone in 2028 i don't think so i i i think you know if you look at the evolution of screens even starting with our televisions for example that were in the living room evolving to you know a screen on your desk to maybe a laptop to today holding a screen in your hand i think there's this sort of dystopian view that we're all going to put screens on our faces and and see the world uh through a screen that way and you know what we've seen at snapchat is in fact people would rather be present in the real world and we think that means that people want to see the world through a lens rather than a screen so i i i kind of think we're at the end of screens and the beginning of lenses which will allow people to experience computing exactly glasses will allow people to experience computing in totally new ways guys that is the difference you're talking about the gram ag on the gram you only show perfection per or as close to perfection as you can get on snap you just send whatever absolutely right that it has less of a negative impact on teenagers as a result i think probably the 1924 thing has been done woody allen mid midnight in paris yes nope goes but hemingway is there f scot gude stein is there i know picasso is there and you know where they were all eating this is what i'm getting to back then where we were eating last night last night on our date on our date on our mandate always have paris we'll always have paris evan in his old age has become a politician i also asked him about tik tok and he was very good about you know not slamming them deuring deuring on an answer so probably smart probably smart but telling that his 13-year-old is only allowed partial by the way most tech executives don't let their near the phone what does that tell you all our guests are becoming experts at deuring if you've noticed lately i guess they know that they're going to be asked at this point right are are you learning about the you're not learning yeah i don't dem i don't dem either no that's like part of the good thing and part of the bad thing that does it for this episode of squawk pod don't miss the rest of our squawk pod olympics coverage right here in your podcast feed just make sure you follow
