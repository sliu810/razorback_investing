oX7OduG1YmI,The Future Mark Zuckerberg Is Trying To Build,2024-09-25 12:54:09-05:00,48,Cleo Abram,"(""I'd love to start with these. 10 years of work\xa0\nright there. Someone on your team called these\xa0\xa0 the real life Tony Stark glasses. Very hard\xa0\nto make each one of these... That makes me feel\xa0\xa0 incredibly optimistic... In a world where AI\xa0\ngets smarter and smarter... This is probably\xa0\xa0 going to be the next major platform after\xa0\nphones... I miss hugging my mom. Yeah haptics\xa0\xa0 is hard... How does generative AI change\xa0\nhow social media feels?... We haven't found\xa0\xa0 the end yet... The average American has fewer\xa0\nfriends now than they did 15 years ago. Why\xa0\xa0 do you think that's happening? I mean\xa0\nthere's a lot going on to to unpack there... I'm about to interview Meta CEO\nMark\xa0Zuckerberg. There are not\xa0\xa0 that many people with more power over what our\xa0\nfuture might look like. Nearly half the total human\xa0\xa0 population now uses Meta products and I just\xa0\ntested some of their new tech that feels like\xa0\xa0 science fiction. This is crazy! Mark Zuckerberg and\xa0\nthe team at Meta are imagining a future that billions\xa0\xa0 of other people might actually end up living in. So\xa0\nmy goal for this conversation is to try to figure\xa0\xa0 out what that future really looks like. To paint a\xa0\npicture of the future Mark Zuckerberg is trying to\xa0\xa0 build so that you can decide for yourself what you\xa0\nthink of it. Welcome to the first episode of our\xa0\xa0 new series, Huge Conversations Hey, good\xa0to meet you! Thanks\nfor doing this. Yeah looking forward\xa0\xa0 to it. Awesome. I'd love to tell you what my goal\xa0\nis of this conversation. Go for it. We have a called\xa0\xa0 huge if true which is this very optimistic about\xa0\nscience and technology and the potential futures\xa0\xa0 that we can build and in every episode we're sort\xa0\nof exploring what does it look like if you play a\xa0\xa0 certain technological future out and so my goal\xa0\nin this conversation is to try to help people\xa0\xa0 see the future that you're imagining when you're\xa0\nbuilding the products that you and the Meta team\xa0\xa0 are building. What are you imagining this looks\xa0\nlike in future? How are you imagining people use\xa0\xa0 this? All of that. Cool. All right awesome. So\xa0\nI'd love to start with these. Let's do it. 10 years\xa0\xa0 of work right there! I got to demo them a little\xa0\nbit earlier today. I heard someone on your team\xa0\xa0 call these the real life Tony Stark glasses? We're\xa0\ngetting there. But I'd love to just hear in your\xa0\xa0 voice what are these? Well these are the first full\xa0\nholographic augmented reality glasses I think that\xa0\xa0 exist in the world. We've made I think it's a\xa0\na few thousand or something right. Very hard to\xa0\xa0 make each one of these but this is the culmination\xa0\nof 10 years of research and and development that\xa0\xa0 we've done to basically miniaturize all the\xa0\ncomputing that you need to have glasses not a\xa0\xa0 headset but glasses that can put full holograms\xa0\ninto the world with a wide field of view. So you\xa0\xa0 can imagine sort of in the future we'd be having a\xa0\nversion of this conversation where you know maybe\xa0\xa0 I or you are not even here it's like one of us is\xa0\nphysically here and the other one is here as a as\xa0\xa0 kind of a full body hologram and it's not just\xa0\na video call you can actually interact you can\xa0\xa0 do things I mean in the the demo we had the you\xa0\nknow ping pong and games and things like that but\xa0\xa0 I mean you could you can interact you can work\xa0\ntogether you can you know play poker play chests\xa0\xa0 whatever like the holographic cards holographic\xa0\nboard game. I just think it's going to be wild. it's going to remake I think so many different\xa0\nfields that we think about today from how we work\xa0\xa0 and productivity to a lot of things around science\xa0\na lot of things around education entertainment fun\xa0\xa0 gaming. But this is just the beginning you\xa0\nknow this is the first version, it's a\xa0\xa0 prototype version that we've made in order\xa0\nto develop the next version which is hopefully\xa0\xa0 going to be the consumer one that we sell to\xa0\na lot of people. Why build these? Well I think\xa0\xa0 it's going to be the next major computing platform.\xa0\nSo if you look at like the grand arc of computing\xa0\xa0 over time you've you've gone from like main\xa0\nframes to computers that basically like live\xa0\xa0 on you know your desk or on a tower to phones\xa0\nthat you have in your hand that you basically\xa0\xa0 like you know can take with you everywhere that\xa0\nyou want but it's it's pretty unnatural right it\xa0\xa0 takes you away from the world around you and. I\xa0\nthink that the trend in computing is it gets more\xa0\xa0 ubiquitous it gets more natural and it just\xa0\ngets more social right so you want to be able\xa0\xa0 to interact with people in the world around you\xa0\nand I think that this is probably going to be\xa0\xa0 the next major platform after phones. I'll give\xa0\nthese to you. These are the clear ones that show\xa0\xa0 all the... The whole thing is a special edition and\xa0\nthis is like a really special edition. There's\xa0\xa0 not a single millimeter of of space. You know\xa0\neverything in here from the micro projectors that\xa0\xa0 um basically shoot light into the wave guides\xa0\nright it's a special type of display system. I\xa0\xa0 mean these aren't normal displays like you have\xa0\nin a phone or a TV or computer like the type of\xa0\xa0 displays that people have been building for\xa0\ndecades. It's a waveguide system. The projector\xa0\xa0 that's shooting light basically goes into these\xa0\nnano etchings across the wave guide that are what\xa0\xa0 catches and creates the holograms. In order to\xa0\nsynchronize that with your where you're looking\xa0\xa0 there's eye tracking and little cameras,\xa0\nthey illuminate your eyes and then of course\xa0\xa0 there's all the basic stuff that you need all the\xa0\ncomputing, the batteries to power the whole thing,\xa0\xa0 microphones, the speakers because it needs to be\xa0\nable to play audio and speak with you and the\xa0\xa0 cameras and sensors to see things around you in\xa0\nthe world so that way when it's placing holograms\xa0\xa0 in the world it can do that in the right place\xa0\nand understand where you are so that probably\xa0\xa0 is still not covering everything because there's\xa0\na lot of things that need to go into syncing up\xa0\xa0 the holographic images between the two displays\xa0\nbecause you don't just have a single display\xa0\xa0 like you have in a phone or TV you have two and\xa0\nit moves around and you know physical things\xa0\xa0 are hard and need to be synced up. There's also\xa0\nthe radio that has to communicate with your other\xa0\xa0 computing devices to do heavier computing um and\xa0\nthe wrist based neural interface that you probably\xa0\xa0 got to try out. We kind of miniaturized all of this\xa0\nand fit it into uh you know normal looking pair of\xa0\xa0 glasses which is... you know when I told the team\xa0\nthat we were going to do this 10 years ago you\xa0\xa0 know people weren't sure if we were going to be\xa0\nable to but I think you not only we're going\xa0\xa0 to be able to do this but I think we're going to\xa0\nbe able to get it cheaper and higher quality and\xa0\xa0 even even smaller and more stylish over time. So\xa0\nI think this is going to be a pretty wild future.\xa0\xa0 There are so many versions of trying to get\xa0\na similar idea of digital objects in physical\xa0\xa0 space. I'm thinking of for example of glasses that\xa0\nhave heads up displays where it's headlocked and\xa0\xa0 it's moving with my eyes, glasses that are really\xa0\ncreating digital objects in physical space that\xa0\xa0 don't move as I move, I'm thinking of these, I'm\xa0\nalso thinking of the Snapchat Spectacles that they\xa0\xa0 just announced, then on the other hand there are\xa0\nheadsets like the Quest and also like the Apple\xa0\xa0 Vision Pro that seem to fall into a different\xa0\ncategory. I'm curious how you would organize this\xa0\xa0 landscape for people and how you think about\xa0\npeople using these tools in their real lives\xa0\xa0 in the near future? Yeah so when we were getting\xa0\nstarted on this about 10 years ago I thought that\xa0\xa0 something like this was going to be the ultimate\xa0\nproduct for everyone. Right you get to you know\xa0\xa0 normal looking pair of glasses and we'll continue\xa0\nimproving that that can have full holographic\xa0\xa0 images. I think it's super powerful\xa0\nand it is sort of the science fiction future that\xa0\xa0 I think we all hope to get to. On the journey we\xa0\ntook a few other approaches as well um to help us\xa0\xa0 develop towards that including building glasses\xa0\nthat don't have displays to try to learn. Just\xa0\xa0 take a stylish pair of glasses today and put as\xa0\nmuch technology into it as you can but really\xa0\xa0 focus on the form factor and that's the Ray Ban\xa0\nMeta glasses and it's doing really well and\xa0\xa0 initially we thought that that was sort of intro\xa0\nproduct for us to learn how to build this but one\xa0\xa0 of the things that's clear now is you're going to\xa0\nbe able to make that product a lot more affordable\xa0\xa0 than this probably permanently. So I actually think\xa0\nthat there are going to be a bunch of different of\xa0\xa0 these paths that we've taken are going to be\xa0\nkind of permanent product lines that people\xa0\xa0 will choose. I think you'll see display-less glasses\xa0\nlike the Ray Ban Metas continue to get better and\xa0\xa0 better, great for AI, no display but you can talk\xa0\nto it, it can talk back. I think there's going to\xa0\xa0 be something in between these that's basically a\xa0\nheads up display, so it's not a 70° field of view,\xa0\xa0 maybe it's a 20° or 30 degree field of view,\xa0\nso that's not going to be what you want for\xa0\xa0 putting kind of a full hologram of a person or\xa0\ninteracting with the world around you but it's\xa0\xa0 going to be great for you know when you're talking\xa0\nto AI, not just having voice but also being able\xa0\xa0 to see what it's saying or being able to text\xa0\nsomeone with your wrist-based neural interface and\xa0\xa0 then have their text show up rather than having it\xa0\nread to you, which is, we read faster than we\xa0\xa0 can listen or getting directions right or just\xa0\nbeing able to search for information get all that.\xa0\xa0 So there's a lot of value for heads up display\xa0\nthat will be somewhat more expensive than the\xa0\xa0 display-less but somewhat cheaper than this.\xa0\nThen I think you're going to get this. It's going\xa0\xa0 to be probably the most premium and and expensive\xa0\nof glasses products but hopefully still something\xa0\xa0 that you know like a computer is generally\xa0\naccessible to most people in the world but I think\xa0\xa0 that there are going to be all of those and I\xa0\nI think people will like them. I also think that\xa0\xa0 the headsets that people are using around mixed\xa0\nreality will continue to be a thing too because\xa0\xa0 no matter how good we get at miniaturizing\xa0\nthe tech for this you're just going to be\xa0\xa0 able to fit more compute into a full headset.\xa0\nFundamentally our mission is not you know build\xa0\xa0 something that is advanced and only a few people\xa0\ncan use, we want to take it you the last mile and\xa0\xa0 do all the innovation to get it to everyone. We\xa0\nyou know just shipped or announced Quest 3S,\xa0\xa0 the new mixed reality headset where we basically are\xa0\ndelivering high quality mixed reality for $299.\xa0\xa0 I was really proud last year when we delivered\xa0\nQuest 3, the first kind of really high quality\xa0\xa0 high resolution color mixed reality device for\xa0\n$500, right it was like, it's like a fraction of\xa0\xa0 the cost of of what the competitors are doing\xa0\nand I think it's actually higher quality in a\xa0\xa0 lot of ways, and now we've just doubled down on\xa0\nthat. So I think that they're all actually going\xa0\xa0 to end up being important long-term product lines:\xa0\ndisplay-less, heads up display, full holographic\xa0\xa0 AR, full headsets. I think that they're all going\xa0\nto be important. Yeah. If you play out the future\xa0\xa0 of not just the hardware that we've been talking\xa0\nabout so Meta Ray Bans, Quest, Orion, but also\xa0\xa0 the Llama models, if everything goes according to\xa0\nyou and the teams wildest dreams, I'd love for\xa0\xa0 you to just begin to describe what that feels like.\xa0\nI mean I think that there are two primary values\xa0\xa0 that we're trying to bring. On the AR and kind of\xa0\nmixed reality side, the main value we're trying to\xa0\xa0 bring is this feeling of presence .Right so there's\xa0\nsomething that I think is just really deep about\xa0\xa0 being physically present with another person that\xa0\nyou don't get from any other technology today and\xa0\xa0 I think that's the thing when people have a very\xa0\nvisceral reaction to experiencing virtual or mixed\xa0\xa0 reality what they're really reacting to is that\xa0\nthey actually for the first time with technology\xa0\xa0 feel a sense of presence like they're in a place\xa0\nwith the person and that's super powerful. I\xa0\xa0 focused on designing social apps and experiences\xa0\nfor 20 years that's sort of like the Holy Grail\xa0\xa0 of that is being able to build a technology\xa0\nplatform that delivers this like deep sense of\xa0\xa0 of social presence. The other big track is around\xa0\npersonalized AI and for that and that's sort of\xa0\xa0 where Llama and Meta AI and all those things are\xa0\ngoing. There's all this development that's going\xa0\xa0 into making the models smarter and smarter over\xa0\ntime but I think where this is going to get\xa0\xa0 really compelling is when it's personalized for\xa0\nyou and in order for it to be personalized for you\xa0\xa0 it has to have context and understand what's going\xa0\non in your life both kind of at a global level and\xa0\xa0 like what's physically happening around you right\xa0\nnow and in order to do that I think that glasses\xa0\xa0 are going to be the ideal form factor because\xa0\nthey're positioned on your face in a way where\xa0\xa0 they can let them see what you see and hear what\xa0\nyou hear which are the two most important senses\xa0\xa0 that we use for for kind of taking information\xa0\nand context about the world. I think that this is\xa0\xa0 all going to be kind of really deep and profound\xa0\nstuff but it's basically those two things: It's\xa0\xa0 this feeling of presence and this capability\xa0\nof really personalized intelligence that can\xa0\xa0 help you. I'd love to talk about each of those\xa0\ntwo things. The first on presence, I owe a lot\xa0\xa0 to being able to connect with people online. Right\xa0\nthis job that I have is by definition that, also with\xa0\xa0 my family. My parents don't live anywhere close\xa0\nto me. I video call them a lot and when I think\xa0\xa0 about the progress of technology like this in a\xa0\ntimeline from the telegram to the telephone\xa0\xa0 to video call to some feeling of presence with\xa0\nanother person who's feels like they're right\xa0\xa0 there in front of me, that makes me feel incredibly\xa0\noptimistic. I would love a future where like I can\xa0\xa0 lose in Scrabble to my mom and feel like she's\xa0\nreally there in front of me. Yeah and it feels like\xa0\xa0 we're not that far away from something - I agree!\xa0- that\npersuades my brain that that's happening. Yeah\xa0\xa0 totally. And also I miss hugging my mom right like\xa0\nthat never goes away. Yeah haptics is hard. Yeah and\xa0\xa0 so my question is about that\xa0\nit's about this this feeling of like it's hard\xa0\xa0 for me to imagine um a future where real physical\xa0\npresence is not different and special in some way\xa0\xa0 where I don't miss literally hugging my\xa0\nmom and I'm curious how you think about the\xa0\xa0 parts of human connection that are eye contact and\xa0\nphysical touch and things that our ape brains\xa0\xa0 value for connection with other people. Yeah well eye\ncontact I think we're going to get to a lot before\xa0\xa0 the the touch part. For haptics I do think we'll\xa0\nmake progress on that but it's it's obviously\xa0\xa0 there's a spectrum there too from kind of hands\xa0\nwhich is where if you you draw out the kind\xa0\xa0 of like homunculus version of a person in terms\xa0\nof like what are what are our kind of sensory you\xa0\xa0 know what what's like the majority of what we're\xa0\nsensing it's like yeah yeah so I think being\xa0\xa0 able to do that for your hands is probably the\xa0\nmost important place to start and you have a rough\xa0\xa0 version of that with controllers today. I think\xa0\nthat that'll get even more over time. We have this\xa0\xa0 demo playing pingpong where you have a controller\xa0\nwhere as the digital ball hits the ping pong\xa0\xa0 paddle you feel it hit the as if it's hitting the\xa0\nping pong paddle wherever it is so you actually\xa0\xa0 have a sense of like where it's it's hitting\xa0\nthe the the paddle so I think that was that\xa0\xa0 was just a wild demo so I think we'll get some of\xa0\nthat the most extreme version of this is wanting\xa0\xa0 force feedback right so I mean like for doing a lot\xa0\nof sports right it's it's like okay we can kind of\xa0\xa0 do a good approximation of like boxing today or\xa0\nyou get like good feedback on your hands but it\xa0\xa0 would be hard to do a virtual reality version of\xa0\nJiu-Jitsu where you're like grappling with someone and\xa0\xa0 you need like real kind of force feedback on\xa0\nthat so that's probably like the hardest thing\xa0\xa0 right to go do but I think we'll get there.\xa0\nYou know I think like most science fiction it's\xa0\xa0 not this binary thing that you just like wake up\xa0\none day and we're like oh we've realized all the\xa0\xa0 dreams but but I I do think that these platforms\xa0\nare going to be the first time that I think that\xa0\xa0 there's a realistic sense of presence in all\xa0\nthe ways that that's special to people for\xa0\xa0 most things that people want to do which are not\xa0\nthe most physical ones and even some of the basic\xa0\xa0 physical ones I think we'll get. But then there's\xa0\na long tale of other stuff I mean smell is also\xa0\xa0 really important for people yeah right it's\xa0\nI think it's disproportionately important for\xa0\xa0 memories and that's not really a thing that\xa0\nI think in the next few years we're going to\xa0\xa0 have in any of these devices I mean that's a very\xa0\ndifficult and challenging thing on its own. What is\xa0\xa0 the piece of that that you feel most interested in,\xa0\nthat you keep coming back to in your mind? This has\xa0\xa0 the frustrating property to develop that the\xa0\nsense of presence is almost like when you're\xa0\xa0 designing something that that's sort of trying\xa0\nto artificially deliver it you're delivering\xa0\xa0 an illusion to a person and more than any one\xa0\nthing that provides a sense of presence it's\xa0\xa0 actually more the case that any one thing done\xa0\nwrong breaks the sense of presence. You kind\xa0\xa0 of know that you're interacting with technology\xa0\nbut it's so convincing that um that you just kind\xa0\xa0 of go along with it. You're like okay yeah no this\xa0\nperson feels like it feel like they're there right.\xa0\xa0 When I did that pingpong demo I like at the end\xa0\nof it I dropped the pingpong paddle on the virtual\xa0\xa0 table and it shattered so that was not the best\xa0\nfor for our internal development but\xa0\xa0 like that's winning in our in our development\xa0\nright it's like when when you feel like something\xa0\xa0 is is kind of so realistic that you you're just\xa0\nconvinced that um that it's there now and there\xa0\xa0 are a lot of things that can break that right so\xa0\nI think a a field of view that's too low right so\xa0\xa0 something feels real but then you turn your head\xa0\nand it's not there um latency read physics that\xa0\xa0 don't behave like realistic physics. It also is\xa0\ninteresting in some ways what people can accept\xa0\xa0 as physically real even though it's not right\xa0\nso like we've done a ton of work on avatars we\xa0\xa0 we have this whole work stream on Kodak avatars\xa0\nto do these photo avatars and it's I think it's\xa0\xa0 going to be incredbly compelling and people are\xa0\ngoing to love it but one of the things I found\xa0\xa0 interesting is the ability to mix photorealistic\xa0\nand expressive kind of the cartoony avatars with\xa0\xa0 photorealistic worlds and kind of more cartoony\xa0\ncomputer game type worlds so you can have the\xa0\xa0 a Kodak kind of photorealistic avatar of a\xa0\nperson in what is clearly like a video game\xa0\xa0 or cartoon world and people are generally\xa0\npretty fine with that it's like okay that\xa0\xa0 that feels pretty good and similarly having\xa0\na photorealistic world but good increasingly\xa0\xa0 good kind of cartoon avatars as long as the\xa0\navatars move in a way that feels authentic to\xa0\xa0 the person you're interacting with it actually\xa0\nfeels pretty good you know it's when you look at\xa0\xa0 a 2d still frame of it some of the stuff can\xa0\nlook a little bit silly and and we've certainly\xa0\xa0 you know had had a our share of memes around\xa0\nthat but um but when you're in there you know and\xa0\xa0 you you've played around with lot of the stuff it\xa0\nfeels realistic because it's basically mimicking\xa0\xa0 the kind of authentic mannerisms of of a person\xa0\nthat you're interacting with and even if it's not\xa0\xa0 a Kodak photo realistic avatar if it's kind of\xa0\na more cartoony expressive one so I I think that\xa0\xa0 that's it's very interesting to see kind of\xa0\nwhich pieces you need to unlock and what where you\xa0\xa0 just need to be like very technically excellent\xa0\nand consistent but it's um this isn't a space\xa0\xa0 where it's like you deliver one thing and it's\xa0\ngood this is like there's a wide breth of things\xa0\xa0 that you need to nail and then have it all come\xa0\ntogether and that's why these are you know 10 year projects. It seems like an interesting way to learn\xa0\nabout the human brain and what we actually care\xa0\xa0 about with respect to what feels real. I was\xa0\nwondering about, there was this moment in an\xa0\xa0 interview that you did with Lex Friedman, you quoted\xa0\nresearch that says that the average American has\xa0\xa0 fewer friends now than they did 15 years ago\xa0 and I was so interested in that because\xa0\xa0 it seems like if we want to get to a world where\xa0\nthere's more human connection this is the trend\xa0\xa0 that we're going to have to grapple with and just\xa0\nto give some data on this in the American Time Use\xa0 Survey over the last 20 years the amount of time\xa0\nAmerican adults spend socializing in person has\xa0\xa0 dropped by nearly 30%. For ages 15 to 24 according\xa0\nto the Surgeon General it's nearly 70%. and I\xa0\xa0 look at that data and I think to myself well maybe\xa0\nif we're all socializing digitally that doesn't\xa0\xa0 matter so much maybe there's a future where that's\xa0\nactually fine but there's also data that suggest\xa0\xa0 that we're struggling somewhat. The number of\xa0\nAmericans who say that they don't have a single\xa0\xa0 close friend - yeah it's really sad - that share has\njumped from 3% to 12%\xa0in the last 30 years. It feels to me like with all the tools that we've built for human\nconnection, we're struggling to connect and I'm curious\xa0\xa0 why do you think that's happening? I mean there's a lot\xa0\ngoing on to to unpack there. A lot has changed\xa0\xa0 sort of economically and socially during that\xa0\nperiod and a lot of those trends go back before\xa0\xa0 a lot of the modern technology. So I mean this\xa0\nis something that a lot of academics and folks\xa0\xa0 have have studied but it is an interesting lens\xa0\nto look at this though because I think whenever\xa0\xa0 you're talking about building digital types\xa0\nof connection one of the first questions that\xa0\xa0 you get is is that going to replace the physical\xa0\nconnection and my answer to that especially in the\xa0\xa0 case of something like this is that no because\xa0\npeople already don't have as much connection\xa0\xa0 as they would like to have. It's not like this is\xa0\nreplacing some sort of better physical connection\xa0\xa0 that they would have otherwise had. It's that the\xa0\naverage person would like to have 10 friends and\xa0\xa0 they have two right or three and there's just\xa0\nmore demand to socialize than what people are\xa0\xa0 able to do given the current construct and giving\xa0\npeople the ability to be present with people who\xa0\xa0 are in other places physically just seems like\xa0\nit will unlock more. It's not going to make it\xa0\xa0 so, if I have glasses, it's not going to make\xa0\nit that I spend less time with my wife, it's going\xa0\xa0 to make it so that I spend more time with you\xa0\nknow my sister who lives across the country. And\xa0\xa0 that's, I think that's good. I\xa0\nthink people need that. As for the rest, I\xa0\xa0 I think we could probably spend a multi-hour\xa0\npodcast just going into all of the different\xa0\xa0 kind of socioeconomic political dynamics that are\xa0\ngoing on but none of the trends that I've seen\xa0\xa0 does it seem like the primary thing that's going\xa0\non is that because people are interacting online\xa0\xa0 they're now not interacting with their with people\nphysically. Now certainly I think you\xa0\xa0 you I do interact with people online who I also\xa0\nlike to interact with physically but and I think\xa0\xa0 that that's kind of like a combination um like\xa0\nmore combined richer relationship that you have\xa0\xa0 overall but I think that there's a lot going\xa0\non with the loss of of kind of social capital and\xa0\xa0 connections that really predates a lot of the\xa0\nmodern technology. The goal of what, I'm what I'm\xa0\xa0 trying most to learn about is how we can structure\xa0\nthe technologies that we use in the future to get\xa0\xa0 toward this future I think you're imagining of\xa0\nmore human connection in more ways. I'm curious, you\xa0\xa0 brought up the other big pillar of AI and in some\xa0\nof your conversations, I'm thinking of a conversation\xa0\xa0 with Tim Ferris in particular, you talked about\xa0\na lot of different use cases of AI and they seem\xa0\xa0 to me to fall on somewhat of a spectrum. Like\xa0\nfor example you mentioned automatic real-time\xa0\xa0 translation, like basically the Star Trek\xa0\nUniversal translator. We're pretty\xa0\xa0 much there! Yeah and that's one example on one\xa0\nend of the spectrum where some people might argue\xa0\xa0 that there is a chance that someone is less likely\xa0\nfor example to learn a language because we can all\xa0\xa0 speak to each other in real time in different\xa0\nlanguages. I think nobody would really argue\xa0\xa0 that therefore we shouldn't have that kind of\xa0\nuniversal translator. People still learn Latin and\xa0\xa0 Greek. Right exactly and so I think that end\xa0\nof the spectrum is something like um technologies\xa0\xa0 that really measurably unlock our humanity because\xa0\nthey remove a struggle between people and then on\xa0\xa0 the other end of the spectrum there are a lot of\xa0\neducational things for example where the struggle\xa0\xa0 is kind of the point right? Like it's like building\xa0\na muscle. I can think of so many times\xa0\xa0 in my life where like the reason why I was doing\xa0\nsomething was not the output it was the fact that\xa0\xa0 I was trying so hard to do it. There's one example\xa0\nin the Tim Ferris interview where you talked\xa0\xa0 about your kids struggling to articulate\xa0\nthemselves emotionally and adults very much had\xa0\xa0 the same problem and you talked about AI as a way\xa0\nto help them articulate those emotions. Yeah and\xa0\xa0 I thought about all of the many times in my life\xa0\nwhere I have struggled to articulate my emotions\xa0\xa0 and how I really could have used some help in\xa0\nthose moments and I also found myself thinking\xa0\xa0 about the times when that was really building\xa0\na muscle where like the act of struggling to\xa0\xa0 communicate with someone and understand what they\xa0\nwanted from me was was important to my development.\xa0\xa0 And so my question is if you think about that\xa0\nas a spectrum between things that are really\xa0\xa0 important to our humanity where and the struggle\xa0\nbeing removed is helpful versus things where the\xa0\xa0 struggle is the point and it unlocks\xa0\nsomething about our humanity and is important\xa0\xa0 to preserve like building a muscle, how do you\xa0\ndraw the line between those things and how do\xa0\xa0 we ensure that the muscles that we're building for\xa0\nthis future are stronger and not weaker? Yeah it's\xa0\xa0 interesting I mean I think we're always going to\xa0\nfind new things to struggle with and I mean it's\xa0\xa0 you can always get better at communicating with\xa0\nother people and kind of expressing yourself and\xa0\xa0 understanding other people so having a tool that\xa0\ncan help you do that better isn't going to mean\xa0\xa0 that like oh now we perfectly understand every you\xa0\nknow it's I mean I think the maybe one\xa0\xa0 of the most functional aspects of this you're\xa0\nalready seeing a lot of these AI models really\xa0\xa0 help people with coding right like a generation\xa0\nago um before I was getting started a lot of\xa0\xa0 coding was like really low-level system software\xa0\nand you know then by the time that I got into\xa0\xa0 it there was a little bit of that but um you you\xa0\ncan make websites pretty easily make apps pretty\xa0\xa0 easily and I think in 20 years or a lot sooner\xa0\nthan that you're going to basically be in a\xa0\xa0 world where kids will be able to just describe the\xa0\nthings that they want and build incredibly complex\xa0\xa0 pieces of software so it's um in that world\xa0\nare kids going to be not struggling I I don't\xa0\xa0 think so I think that they're going to be just\xa0\nexpressing their creativity and and it'll it'll\xa0\xa0 be this kind of constant iterative feedback loop\xa0\naround like okay like yeah I you know took a few\xa0\xa0 minutes to describe this thing and like yeah this\xa0\nwhole like amazing virtual world was created that\xa0\xa0 I can have see on my glasses or whatever but like\xa0\nthese things are not exactly what I want them to\xa0\xa0 be so now I need to like go back and edit them it\xa0\njust I don't know I think that there's always\xa0\xa0 more. Another way to get this - it's one of the things\xa0\nthat I think makes makes people so good. It just\xa0\xa0 there's there's always more to do. We'll always\xa0\nfind the struggle? Yeah. Another way to get at this\xa0\xa0 is if you if you play this out to make the\xa0\ntools even better in like 10 years let's say\xa0\xa0 your kids are in high school are there ways that\xa0\nyou would want them using AI because you think it\xa0\xa0 would accelerate them intellectually and ways that\xa0\nyou would advocate for them not to use it or\xa0\xa0 things that you would have concerns about? I mean\xa0\nI think that there's some things that you need\xa0\xa0 to be able to do yourself. I think that's a lot of\xa0\nthe basic fear that people have around this is\xa0 that while we're building these amazing tools we\xa0\nget away from this self-confidence and ability of\xa0\xa0 being able to do like this basic stuff yourself so\xa0\nit's like all right you have a calculator but it's\xa0\xa0 still good to be able to do kind of basic math in\xa0\nyour head because there are a lot of things that\xa0\xa0 come up throughout the day that you just want to\xa0\nhave a general numeracy around right that often\xa0\xa0 they're not expressed in numerical terms but just\xa0\nin terms of understanding trends or understanding\xa0\xa0 arguments that people are making, you you kind of\xa0\nneed to understand the shape of how numbers come\xa0\xa0 together and so I think one of the big debates\xa0\nis like should we still teach our kids to program\xa0\xa0 computers even though you're going to have\nthese tools in the future that are just so much\xa0\xa0 more powerful than anything that we have now to\xa0\nproduce incredibly complicated pieces of software.\xa0\xa0 I think the answer to that is probably yes\xa0\nbecause I think teaching someone how to code\xa0\xa0 is teaching them a way to think rigorously and\xa0\nthat even if they're not doing most of the code\xa0\xa0 production I think it's important that you kind of\xa0\nhave the ability to think in that way and I think\xa0\xa0 it's going to just make you generally a better\xa0\nthinker and better person so yeah maybe that's\xa0\xa0 like this generation's version of calculators\xa0\nit's like so you you want to you want to use the\xa0\xa0 calculator but you'll also want to be able to\xa0\ngenerally do without it. Other ones like language\xa0\xa0 I don't know I mean different people can come\xa0\nout I think this is one of the interesting\xa0\xa0 questions about parenting these days is like is\xa0\nis just kind of like what what's important to\xa0\xa0 teach your your kids and in an era where so much\xa0\nis going to change over the the time that they're\xa0\xa0 even in school. Language I think you can make\xa0\nsimilar arguments. I think there's a lot of it's\xa0\xa0 like it's probably going to be less functionally\xa0\nrelevant in the future to learn multiple languages\xa0\xa0 but it sort of helps you think in different ways,\nyou know I found from the languages that I've\xa0\xa0 studied that a lot of it you learn about\xa0\nthe structure of your own language, you can\xa0\xa0 you know you also learn about the culture right\xa0\nbecause so much of how things are expressed in\xa0\xa0 different places is tied to the nuance and the\xa0\nhistory of kind of what how so I think\xa0\xa0 like you that's all valuable and interesting\xa0\nstuff to get into but then I don't know at the\xa0\xa0 same time we only have so many hours in the day\xa0\nso people need to prioritize what they're going\xa0\xa0 to learn and it may be that okay in a world with\xa0\nperfect translation which by the way we basically\xa0\xa0 just announced on the Ray Ban Metas that now\xa0\nyou're going to be able to just like you go to\xa0\xa0 countries yeah we're starting out with just a few\xa0\nlanguages but we'll roll it out to more and you\xa0\xa0 know you'll be you could be traveling anywhere and\xa0\nyou have your glasses and they just translate in\xa0\xa0 real time in your ear. So it's wild, yeah so\xa0\nI think people are going to need to choose what\xa0\xa0 what what they want to focus on going forward.\xa0\nHow do the developments that we've been talking\xa0\xa0 about in AI intersect with social media and the\xa0\nplatforms that most people use today? There's a\xa0 future where there's images and generated text\xa0\nand maybe AI influencers. How does generative\xa0\xa0 AI change how social media feels in the future?\xa0\nYeah I mean I think that that's a really\xa0\xa0 deep one. You know there's already been one\xa0\nbig shift which is that social media started\xa0\xa0 out as people primarily interacting with their\xa0\nfriends and now it is you know at least half of\xa0\xa0 the content is basically people interacting\xa0\nwith creators or content that's not created\xa0\xa0 by people who they kind of personally know so\xa0\nwe sort sort of already have that paradigm and\xa0\xa0 I think AI is probably going to accelerate that. It\xa0\nwill give all these people additional tools right\xa0\xa0 so your friends will create kind of funnier memes\xa0\nand more interesting content um that'll come from\xa0\xa0 a lot of different ways. I think some of it will\xa0\nbe okay your friends have glasses and they capture\xa0\xa0 a bunch of stuff and before they might have not\xa0\nbeen able bble to edit it to make it interesting\xa0\xa0 or maybe it was just too much work or they didn't\xa0\neven realize that they captured something amazing\xa0\xa0 but now the AI is like hey I like made this thing\xa0\nfor you out of your content um it's like okay\xa0\xa0 that's awesome like people will enjoy that. Creators\xa0\nobviously kind of much more specialized skills\xa0\xa0 are going to be able to use even more advanced AI\xa0\ntools to make more compelling content but then I\xa0\xa0 think that there will be a bunch of kind of green\xa0\nfield type stuff where maybe in the future there\xa0\xa0 will be content that is purely generated by AI\xa0\nby the system personalized for you maybe it's\xa0\xa0 summarizing things that are out there that that\xa0\nare going to be interesting maybe it's um just\xa0\xa0 producing something funny that makes you laugh\xa0\nthis is going to be like a very kind of deep zone\xa0\xa0 that there's a lot to to experiment with.\xa0\nI think there are going to be AI creators as well,\xa0 as creators building AI versions of themselves,\xa0\nI mean that's a thing that we just showed too\xa0\xa0 at Connect is basically I mean if\xa0you're\na Creator one of the big challenges is\xa0\xa0 like all right there are only so many hours\xa0\nin the day and your community probably has a\xa0\xa0 nearly unlimited demand to interact with you and\xa0\nyou want to interact with them because you're\xa0\xa0 trying to grow your community. I mean that's both\xa0\nsocially and from a business perspective that's\xa0\xa0 sort of you know growing the community is an\xa0\nimportant part of what every creator does so\xa0\xa0 okay if we can make it so that each creator\xa0\ncan basically make an like an AI artifact\xa0\xa0 that their community can interact with people be\xa0\nclear it's not the actual creator themselves but\xa0\xa0 it's almost like a piece of digital art that\xa0\nyou're producing like an interactive sculpture\xa0\xa0 or something that it's like it's like you train\xa0\nit to here's the context that I wanted to have\xa0\xa0 here's the topics I wanted to communicate\xa0\non here's stuff that I wanted to stay away\xa0\xa0 from you're giving your community something to\xa0\ninteract with when you can't be there to to kind\xa0\xa0 of answer all the questions and I think that's\xa0\ngoing to be super compelling so there's like\xa0\xa0 these interesting things but I think it's I AI\xa0\nit's kind of like the internet in a way where\xa0\xa0 it's probably going to change almost every field\xa0\nand almost every feature of every application that\xa0\xa0 we use um it seems sort of hyperbolic to say that\xa0\nbut I do think that's true and it's just hard to\xa0\xa0 sort of enumerate all the different things up\xa0\nfront but I think that over the next 5 to 10\xa0\xa0 years we're just going to explore the impacts\xa0\nin each of these areas and it's going to be\xa0\xa0 like an amazing amount of innovation and really\xa0\nexciting. I feel two things simultaneously when\xa0\xa0 you say that. I feel both like I really want\xa0\nto be optimistic about the future of these\xa0\xa0 platforms and I obviously have gained so much from\xa0\nan enormous pace of change right like everything\xa0\xa0 that we're doing now and what I actually feel is\xa0\nworried. I feel some specific concerns around the\xa0\xa0 way that you know I might communicate with an\xa0\naudience and the way that they might respond to\xa0\xa0 that or the way that human communication might\xa0\nchange but also more generalized just sort of\xa0\xa0 fear of the pace of change and and worry and I\xa0\ndon't think I'm alone in that feeling. Yeah and\xa0\xa0 you're supposed to be the optimist! I know! And I'm\xa0\ncurious like how you talk to people who feel that\xa0\xa0 way. What concerns do you feel are most legitimate\xa0\nand what do you feel most misunderstood? I think\xa0\xa0 the pace of change is always a concerning\xa0\nthing right it's there is a lot of uncertainty\xa0\xa0 about how how things will go in the future and\xa0\nwe're all going to get really amazing new tools\xa0\xa0 to do both our hobbies and our jobs and\nthey'll make it so we can do better work and\xa0\xa0 have better lives but at least on the professional\xa0\nside it's going to be our responsibility to keep\xa0\xa0 up with that or else it's going to be difficult\xa0\nfor us to compete with other people who are\xa0\xa0 doing a good job of kind of keeping up with\xa0\nthe new trends. So I get it. I mean I think\xa0\xa0 you know especially in the you know line of of\xa0\nwork of being a creator and it's a very sort of\xa0\xa0 competitive space, I don't think that like creators\xa0\nnecessarily think about it as competitive but it\xa0\xa0 is right it's like it's you know and um and so I\xa0\nget it. I think that this is going to make it so\xa0\xa0 that like the quality of work that people produce\xa0\nand how interesting it is and how much they can\xa0\xa0 communicate and like really efficiently is is\xa0\njust going to kind of go through the roof but\xa0\xa0 but when you're staring down a set of changes like\xa0\nyou know that there's some big change coming and\xa0\xa0 you don't know what it is that's always a time of\xa0\nanxiety so I get it. If I take my creator hat\xa0\xa0 off and I'm just a person who is youngish starting\xa0\nout my career-ish, starting out building a family,\xa0\xa0 how would you advise someone like me to prepare\xa0\nwell for the future that we're headed toward\xa0\xa0 to be able to learn new skills now or just think\xa0\nabout this future in an educated way? Yeah I mean\xa0\xa0 I just think maintaining curiosity about things is\xa0\nis important. I do think we can overstate to what\xa0\xa0 extent the next 10 years is going to be sort of\xa0\ndifferent from the last 10 or 15. I mean a ton of\xa0\xa0 stuff changed over the last 10 or 15 years too.\xa0\nIt's not like this is the only time in history\xa0\xa0 where there's some technology it's going to make\xa0\nit so there's new opportunities and things change\xa0\xa0 the internet coming into maturity and everyone\xa0\nhaving smartphones has already rewired things\xa0\xa0 dramatically and I mean maybe the next period will\xa0\nbe a somewhat bigger change or maybe it won't I\xa0\xa0 think it'll feel different to different people but\n I don't think this is like going from zero to\xa0\xa0 one it's not like okay everything's just kind of\xa0\nbeen normal and now like now it's about to change\xa0\xa0 it's like the technology of evolves over time and\xa0\nand like the opportunities that we have evolve and\xa0\xa0 improve and I think that's like the people who\xa0\ndo well I think are are people who are generally\xa0\xa0 curious about it and and dig in and and try\xa0\nto use it to live better lives rather than the\xa0\xa0 people who who basically you know try to fight it\xa0\nin in some way. One thing that I really want to ask\xa0\xa0 you about is open source. Yeah. I think imagine that\xa0\nwe're talking to an audience that has maybe heard\xa0\xa0 that term but doesn't have any real idea of how\xa0\nthat might impact them in the development of AI.\xa0 How would you explain the reasonable debate\xa0\nthat people in your field are having about this\xa0\xa0 right now? Well I think there are two pieces. I mean\xa0\nso what does open source mean? It means that people\xa0\xa0 can build a lot of different things right so at\xa0\na high level I look at the vision that a bunch of\xa0\xa0 companies have right so Open AI, Google, they're\xa0\nbuilding an AI right like one AI that I think\xa0\xa0 in general they're like okay this is going to be\xa0\nit's like you're going to use they think you're\xa0\xa0 going to use Gemini or ChatGPT for like all the\xa0\ndifferent things that you want to interact with\xa0\xa0 and at a high level that's just not how I think\xa0\nthe world is going to go. I think we're going to\xa0\xa0 have a lot of different AI systems just like we're\xa0\ngoing to have we have a lot of different apps.\xa0\xa0 I think in the future every business just like\xa0\nthey have a website and a phone number and an\xa0\xa0 email address and a social media account is also\xa0\ngoing to have an AI that can interact with with\xa0\xa0 their customers to help them sell things to help\xa0\nthem do support. I think a lot of creators will\xa0\xa0 have their own AIs right I think like a lot\xa0\nof people will interact with with a bunch of\xa0\xa0 different things. There's a question of okay do you\xa0\nwant a future that's fundamentally kind of very\xa0\xa0 concentrated and where you're interacting with\xa0\nkind of one system for everything or do you want\xa0\xa0 one where a lot of different people are building\na lot of different AIs and systems just kind\xa0\xa0 of like you probably didn't want there to be you\xa0\nknow just one app or just one website. It's like a\xa0\xa0 richer world when there's a diversity of different\xa0\nthings so that's one piece is is just giving\xa0\xa0 people the ability to build it themselves and\xa0\nwhat open source does it makes it that everyone\xa0\xa0 can take and modify the model and build stuff on\xa0\ntop of it which is different from the kind\xa0\xa0 of closed and centralized approach. The safety\xa0\ndebate is a specific part of this which is in a\xa0\xa0 world where AI gets smarter and smarter, what's the\xa0\nway that we have the highest chance of of having a\xa0\xa0 a a kind of positive future and and not having\xa0\na lot of the safety concerns? And I think some\xa0\xa0 people think that if we keep the model closed\xa0\nand don't give it to a lot of developers that\xa0\xa0 should make it safer because then you don't get\xa0\nbad developers doing bad things with the model. Historically I think what we've seen with open\xa0\nsource is actually the opposite which is that\xa0\xa0 this is not the first open source project right\xa0\nI mean this is obviously this has been a thing in\xa0\xa0 the industry for decades and I think what we've\xa0\ntraditionally seen is that open source software\xa0\xa0 is safer and more secure largely because you put\xa0\nit out there more people can scrutinize it because\xa0\xa0 they can see all parts of the system and then\xa0\nthere are inevitably issues with any software\xa0\xa0 there are bugs there are security issues and\xa0\ninitially with open source people thought hey if\xa0\xa0 you're putting the software out there and there\xa0\nare holes in it isn't everyone just going to go\xa0\xa0 exploit those holes and especially the bad\xa0\nguys but it turned out that it sort of in this\xa0\xa0 counterintuitive way that by making by adding more\xa0\nscrutiny to the systems the holes became apparent\xa0\xa0 quicker and then were fixed and then people\xa0\nroll out a new version just like we roll out\xa0\xa0 a new version of our models right Llama 3, Llama\xa0\n3.1, Llama 3.2 everyone upgrades, so I think the\xa0\xa0 same thing is going to happen here I think it's\xa0\nsort of this counterintuitive thing where even\xa0\xa0 though I I think there's some concern around all\xa0\nright are bad guys going to do bad things with\xa0\xa0 these models. I actually think you just get a kind\xa0\nof smarter and safer model for everyone the more\xa0\xa0 it's rolled out and the more kind of scrutiny\xa0\nis on it and then part of that is we get\xa0\xa0 feedback and we make the model safer so that is\xa0\nwe roll it out to to more people it's safer\xa0\xa0 for more people to use. So I think that the history\xa0\nof open source in the software industry generally\xa0\xa0 would suggest that open source is going to lead\xa0\nto a more prosperous and safer future. Our show\xa0\xa0 is called Huge If True and what I mean by that is\xa0\nkind of testing the most optimistic non-obvious\xa0\xa0 thing and so my question to you is what is the\xa0\nbiggest open genuine question on your mind right now? In which field? You're in so many! I am\xa0\nparticularly curious about the combination of\xa0\xa0 AI and hardware but I realize that we've covered\xa0\na lot so I'm curious the direction you'd take this\xa0\xa0 on a question that occupies you right now. Gosh\xa0\nI mean I think maybe one that's a little more\xa0\xa0 AI specific is there a current set of methods\xa0\nthat seem to be scaling very well right so with\xa0\xa0 past AI architecture you could kind of feed an\xa0\nAI system a certain amount of data and and use\xa0\xa0 a certain amount of compute but eventually it\xa0\nhit a plateau and one of the interesting things\xa0\xa0 about these new transformer based architectures\xa0\nover the last you know 5 to 10 years is that we\xa0\xa0 haven't found the end yet. So that leads to this\xa0\ndynamic where Llama 3 you know we could train on\xa0\xa0 you know 10 to 20,000 gpus, Llama 4 we could train\xa0\non you know more more than 100,000 gpus, Llama 5\xa0\xa0 we can plan to scale even further and there's just\xa0\nan interesting question of how far that goes. It's\xa0\xa0 totally possible that at some point we just like\xa0\nhit a limit and just like previous systems there's\xa0\xa0 an asymptote and it doesn't keep on growing but\xa0\nit's also possible that that limit is not going\xa0\xa0 to happen anytime soon and that we're going to be\xa0\nable to keep on just building more clusters and\xa0\xa0 generating more you know synthetic data train the\xa0\nsystems and that they're just going to keep on\xa0\xa0 getting more and more useful for people for quite\xa0\na while to come and it's a really big and high\xa0\xa0 stakes question I think for for the company is\xa0\nbecause we're basically making these bets on how\xa0\xa0 much infrastructure to build out for the future\xa0\nand this is like hundreds of billions of dollars\xa0\xa0 of infrastructure so like I'm clearly betting\xa0\nthat this is going to keep scaling for a while\xa0\xa0 but it's one of the big questions I think in the\xa0\nfield because it is possible that it doesn't. You\xa0\xa0 know that obviously would lead to a very different\xa0\nworld where it's I mean I'm sure people still\xa0\xa0 figure it out eventually just need to make some\xa0\nnew fundamental improvements to the architecture\xa0\xa0 in some way but that might be a somewhat longer\xa0\ntrajectory for okay maybe you know the the kind\xa0\xa0 of fundamental AI advances slow down for a bit\xa0\nand we just take some time to build new products\xa0\xa0 around this or it could be the case and that's\xa0\nwhat I'm betting on that the fundamental AI will\xa0\xa0 just continue advancing for quite a while and that\xa0\nwe're going to get both a new set of products that\xa0\xa0 are just really compelling in all these ways\xa0\nand that the technology landscape and what's\xa0\xa0 possible will just continue being dynamic over\xa0\nlike a 20-year period and that's probably what\xa0\xa0 I'd guess is going to happen but it I think it's\xa0\none of the bigger questions in the industry and\xa0\xa0 kind of for technology across the world today.\xa0\nIs there anything else that you want to say? I\xa0\xa0 don't know! Awesome. We're good. Amazing yeah thank\xa0\nyou so much for doing this. Yeah no thank you..."", 'en')"
ds2hr9qSkiU,Looking Ahead: The Future of Generative AI – Ben Zhao,2024-09-30 13:48:51-05:00,19,The University of Chicago,"(""Welcome to our video series on generative AI I'm Kevin Boyd the CIO at the University of Chicago and I'm very pleased to have with me today Professor benia a professor in the department of computer science and today we're going to be talking about the future of generative AI so let me ask you we've been uh looking at um so many articles these days that talk about the amazing predictions of what is coming with AI and what the future is going to look like I'm really interested in your perspective on this you know based on based on what you see today what do you think the next big trends are going to be in generative AI wow I mean that's a big question right uh who knows but I think you know from my perspective from a technical perspective I think again people will disagree and a lot of people in machine learning are of two minds um but I personally I think that in some of the architectures that we've been using lately in terms of Transformers and llms and and diffusion models I think we somewhat approaching the plateau of what we can extract from the data that we're getting and and the real bottom neck today is data and you know so much of the models are all about extracting the maximum value out of data but there is only so much data that we have in on Earth in the world and and most of it's already being fed and so I think the expansion now is going to be broad broadly speaking into different applications and that's going to be interesting to see what does happen and which applications don't do turn out to be really useful and applicable um but in terms of just raw power and sort of Amazement I think that really exciting sort of bump was perhaps you know what we just saw in the last few months um but now we're going to sort of get used to some of the things that we're seeing and and that's going to become more sort of DED life interesting um I I guess is the do you think it's sustainable though is this is this something that um maybe the curve is flattening out but are we going to keep seeing um Innovations in the AI field will we be back here having this conversation 10 years from now do you think you know again I think it's a it's a very difficult thing to predict because um it really does depend on what we think right now where the value is in terms of these models I mean I think there are folks who are thinking about you know artificial sort more general intelligence and reasoning but really we're still quite a distance away from that and and right now the architectures we have are still very dependent on the data that we have so if that does hold true then just because we're really getting most of the data in the world already into these models we're going to be sort of slowing down a little bit but if we do have breakthroughs if we do have a way to for example you know design new versions of reinforcement learning that don't require sort of new influx of data then things will change dramatically and um whether that happens you know who knows there's a lot of people very smart people working in the space and so yeah exciting to see you mentioned data a couple times um is there something we should be doing or thinking about differently with data today you know I think there's just a lot of things going on in terms of how we think about data right now and and how we're changing the way that we think about data um you know 20 years ago I was still in grad school when I you know remember the peer-to-peer days I was dealing with music and intellectual property and so on and and of course that's all sort of coming back back again in terms of can anyone use anything on the internet for any reason right and so the courts the legal system the regulatory agencies are figuring that out um but in general that is I think perhaps the biggest deciding factor of how we proceed forward is who owns data and and how much data goes into these models is really going to determine in my opinion how fast these models grow and what is the future that of they can of the things that they can do um you know they can always sort of expanding the new applications I think that is almost certainly going to happen um and it really does come down to the Ingenuity of applying different models to the right applications to where you know you minimize errors and you really maximize the value and the ease of use of that sort of speech interface for example interesting um let's talk a little bit about um how the future may change for jobs it's uh it's interesting how often I hear people say well my job in the future is going to to be taken over by Ai and that's usually followed by a laugh but what do you think is is uh is that going to happen for a lot of people you know unfortunately I think so um you know I I wrote a little answer to a to a question back in 2017 when before all this stuff came around and and my concern back then was that we weren't going to be ready for the job replacement the the ginormous displacement of jobs that we're going to see from Ai and unfortunately right now AI as it is is not displacing the kind of jobs that we would like to displace um we don't have a lot of robots that doing the really tough jobs for us instead we're having software do this kind of thinking and generation and writing and those kind of things are relatively speaking you know a little bit more attractive on the scale of physical labor versus mental tasks and so um yeah it would be really great to see some of the more robotic things I know there's a lot of exciting Innovations in there uh constantly but to see that space sort of catch up and to really get to the point where we can have you know was it the Jetson that had you know household you know robots chasing after you clean the house I mean I think everybody would love one of those at their home I would love a robot like that so so let's talk a little bit about the broader societal impacts of this um it feels like AI keeps popping up in more and more places in the consumer World um I was online creating an - greeting card and at the end of the process it said well would you like to use AI to generate the message you know and and that sort of thing seems to just keep popping up in more and more places talk to me a little bit about how you think this will impact society change um the the day-to-day of society yeah you know that's super interesting because I think we're at an inflection point where if you look at the sci-fi novels that you know some of the great authors wrote 50 60 years ago we're starting to getting to that point where we think about what we value in terms of Being Human and what is humanity and so there are lots of things that we can replace and the question is do we want to replace them and I think we're seeing some of that play out right now in the marketplace a lot of people who consume books and art and so on are already making a very explicit uh statement about preferring human generated content and so that is something that I think you know if you look at like sci-fi dystopian Futures you know where everything's free or everything's cheap accept the human labor aspect of it I think we're perhaps turning that corner and that will be interesting to see because I think valuing human Ingenuity and creativity is really important and in the future AI is going to be everywhere perhaps and it will generate lots of things that are you know very commoditized and readily available and what will be in demand or what will be in short supply is actual human creativity and engineuity so I think we're going to turn that corner and that value sort of system is going to flip on its head um and that's going to be interesting to see so we're seeing that play out right now you know and a lot of companies are basically trying to figure out where the line is right they're trying to say AI everything and that's fine and but the consumer and Society in general is going to make a decision about okay this is what we valued this was what we really prize above all and that value system and that reaction is going to come back and the companies will figure out how to adapt and and to figure out the right sort of bifurcation so I think that's really interesting and um I think it's going to be very fascinating to watch how that line shifts um my own experience has been Sometimes using these tools in the in the more the consumer realm um sometimes the reaction has been wildly positive someone's like oh that was such a heartfelt message and I'm thinking it it was probably better than I might have written myself but it was AI um and that takes us into some ethical considerations um there are so many different ethical dimensions of AI talk to me a bit about how you think about this wow where do we start I mean you know I I think there are a lot of potentials for misuse of AI um I think you know starting from sort of the creation of these models and the training data and respect and consent for intellectual property I think a lot of those questions are being worked out through the court and the regulatory systems but I think you know regardless of how you think they got here the models themselves are very powerful and they are really need the regulation right so if you think about just sort of image generation and the ability to create photos that look absolutely real but yet never happened our Fabrications so there's a lot of implications on how we think about reality and how we perceive our senses and what is information and evidence and disinformation so that I think is going to be something that we're going to be dealing with as a society for quite some time right I mean we've been dealing with dis information outline for a while but this is going to take it to a whole new level where you literally cannot trust your young ears and eyes and so you know how we deal with that in society how we talk to you know members of our own family and authenticate each other on a daily basis I mean there's going to be some really crazy behavioral impact as well um so you know some of that can be really controlled and and limited by Regulatory Agencies and and and uh and governments I think you know the EU is taking some of these early steps that will really be interesting to see how that Fallout impacts the industry and how we uh react to it it may not be enough or it may be too much but I think you know that type of uh figuring out in real time is what we're going to see for a lot of different aspects of society I believe there's already been a case where a uh presidential election in Eastern Europe was um impacted by what appeared to be AI generated content it's going to be very interesting to see how this plays out in the upcoming US election yeah boy there are some real concerns right I think we already saw I think there was a a a def fake voice call uh pretending to be Biden I think it was in Maine I don't if I remember correctly uh these things are going to keep popping up and I think uh technology has to adapt we have to have better protection over uh human voices our own likenesses um you know it used to be it was already the case that we would talk to our kids about you know managing their online presence very carefully but now it's going to be even more critical as they grow up because they are going to be that generation of you know do we want samples of our voice online do we want people to be able to download original undoctored version of our voices because who knows there could be you know digital avatars of us that we don't intend to be out there and that generation is really going to reach the sort of consequences of all the things that we're deciding and inventing right now so thinking about the upcoming generation you and I both obviously work at a university um we get some frequent questions from students and parents um asking all right so what should the Next Generation be majoring in what should they be thinking about to both protect themselves from Ai and also prepare themselves for AI what are your thoughts on that it's such a tough question I've had that question a lot every time I give a talk on AI and and and jobs and and so on um you know I I don't know that we can really predict the future in a clear way because all this stuff is going to fall out in ways that we can't predict so what I would say is you know a liberal arts education is probably as important as ever um being able to adapt being able to be well-versed in different disciplines you know ethics and philosophy are coming back huge that's just ginormous implications of how you make decisions in this ethical landscape right um but also technology of course in science and so uh yeah I would just say be broad you know don't depend on any one thing because you don't know what the job landscape is going to be and being versatile with the liberal arts education is going to be really critical that's great advice um staying in the education track for a minute how do you think educa how do you think education may be changed by AI is is it all going to be personalized learning in the future oh boy you know I think we're dealing with some of that right now and you know um lots of meetings trying to figure out like how do you evaluate students accurately how do you discourage you know um Behavior or plagiarism or anything like that um you know it's it's a real big looming question uh and I think there will be some technological tools technological tools to help um but also we just have to change the way that we teach and and we have to change our value system and students themselves have to understand that there are going to be these tools and do they want to take advantage of them this is coming back to the calculator days of you know yes you can do all the numbers on the calculator but you know um of course things are more complicated right lmms are not as reliable they can you know uh sort of give you wrong answers so they're worse than something like a calculator but it's St quandry of how do you teach the value of education and how do you teach students to understand what do they want to learn versus what do they have to learn um and so I think we as educator Al obviously have to cater our curriculum to to encourage the active learning aspect uh and to really perhaps you know leave the the the the root learning the the the busy work side of things to llms and and generators that's great we've touched on a few things um like the the ethical considerations of AI the um potential impact of AI on um political campaigns deep fakes and the like that sound to me like they may be right for reg for regulation or that uh um I uh individuals are thinking about regulation can you talk a little bit about what you think might be coming or what you're hearing might be coming in the uh in the area of Regulation around AI yeah I think we're still sort of early days in that process obviously um a lot of regulators and legislators are still being educated about what this is what it can do and what it can't do um so that that's going to take a little bit of time but I think you know we're seeing some regulatory actions taking place in the EU I think there's a lot of uh legislative efforts in state governments right now um it's a little bit easier a little bit more local and organized in Illinois and California in New York and some other states there are now different Bills going forth uh sort of working on accountability of AI working on restrictions of AI when it can and cannot be used working on how to develop and and think about ethical Ai and its impact some of them are specifically looking at different applications like in the medical space or Healthcare others are looking at education others so yeah people are really working on this from all different aspects and so I think it's going to be great to see a lot of this come to fruition and of course the industry itself will adapt uh it will have to as always you know when you have a new industry pop up you you learn what the regulatory landscape looks like and what you can and cannot do and and you adapt and so I think yeah the industry will change quite a bit you know a lot of the initial marketing of what you know can and cannot do will change as people get a littleit more realistic about what are the AC applications that are really going to take shape and how we really benefit Society with some of these tools that's great so I'd like to close by um giving you a fairly broad question what do you think is the most exciting um possible future for AI and what would you say is the most concerning possible future for AI you know the that's such a wde that is such a wide range right um I don't think we're going to see AGI uh I'm not one of these people who thinks that we're going to be dealing with a Terminator or or those kind of things but I do think on the negative side that you know it we are our own Worse Enemy right these are powerful tools that misuse we can wreak all sorts of habit with them with elections with attacks with you know disre respect for human likeness and and identity and all these things so you know regul regulations and legal actions will have to take place there technical tools uh like some of the things we're developing here will come have a have a sort of say in things um on the exciting positive side of things I think you know um I think just language and speech is really exciting I think the fact that you know every single one of us deals with language and speech and and communication is such an important part so just to have a system that you know provides a much richer language interface I think will change everything it's something that's tangible that we all deal with and and it's going to benefit all of us uh in some way and you know we don't need it to necessarily write books or write fantastic essays you know I think we still need some work there uh but I think just you know having a much richer language and vocabulary and being able to put a nice interactive voice wrapper around all the devices that we have today I think that's going to be something that really tangibly changes everyone's lives um and as long as you don't ask too much of these models I think they're going to be okay you don't don't ask don't ask for specific facts or dates and things like that but you know just as an interactive like agent and and having that layer I think is going to be a really big positive for a lot of people in different Industries I like that you worked in the Terminator reference that a glad that you think it's probably not around the corner that's great all right well thank you so much Professor Benjo really appreciate you uh being here with me today um and thank you for joining us for uh one of our segments about generative AI I'm Kevin void at the University of Chicago and thank you [Music]"", 'en')"
