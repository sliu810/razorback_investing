Today's call is being recorded. After this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Suhasini Trindamalli, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we're reporting revenue of $94.8 billion for the March quarter, which was better than our expectations. We set an all-time record for services and a March quarter record for iPhone. We were particularly pleased with the performance we saw in emerging markets and achieved all-time records in Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the UAE, as well as a number of March quarter records including in Brazil, Malaysia, and India. This result is a testament, first and foremost, to our teams around the world who are engaged every day in the work of bringing new innovations to life. It speaks to the incredible power of Apple products and services to enrich people's lives in indispensable ways. And whether it's in the design lab in Cupertino or in one of the brand new retail stores in India, I am constantly inspired by the way our people come together to make a real difference in the world. During the March quarter, we continued to face foreign exchange headwinds, which had an impact of more than 500 basis points, as well as ongoing challenges related to the macroeconomic environment. Revenue was down 3% year over year as a result, while on a constant currency basis, we grew in total and in the vast majority of the markets we track. Despite these challenges, we continued to manage for the long term, and to push the limits of what's possible, always on behalf of the customers who depend on our products, whether it's students exploring new frontiers, developers dreaming up their next big idea, or artists taking their creativity to a whole new level. Let me share how these results showed up across our lineup of products and services. Let's start with iPhone, which set a new March quarter record with revenue of $51.3 billion. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus continue to delight users with their long-lasting battery and advanced camera. And our pro users continue to rave about the most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone. This March, we were excited to expand emergency SOS via satellite to six new countries, bringing this important safety feature to even more users. We now offer this vital service in 12 countries And I'm grateful for every note I've received from around the world about the life-saving impact of our safety features. Now let's turn to Mac, which recorded $7.2 billion in revenue for the March quarter in line with our expectations. As we noted during our last call, Mac faced a very difficult compare because of the incredibly successful rollout of our M1 chips throughout the Mac lineup last year. And like our other product lines, Mac is facing some macroeconomic and foreign exchange headwinds as well. That said, the advancements we've made in power-efficient performance continue to amaze our users. Our M2 Mac Mini customers are raving about the pro-level powerhouse packed into an ultra-compact design. And users are marveling at the power and speed at the heart of every M2-powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro which allowed them to sustain even the most demanding workloads. iPad revenue was $6.7 billion, which was also in line with our expectations. Similar to Mac, iPad revenue performance was impacted by macroeconomic challenges, foreign exchange headwinds, and a difficult compare with last year when we launched the M1-powered iPad Air. iPad's versatility continues to be its greatest strength as we're helping students learn on the same family of devices artists use to create their next masterpiece. Across wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.8 billion. With its exceptional range of game-changing health and safety features, Apple Watch becomes more and more indispensable every day. Apple Watch Ultra is attracting adventurers, athletes, and everyday users with its breakthrough features built for endurance and exploration. And with summer travel season soon heating up, there's no better companion in the air or on the road than AirPods, the best and most popular headphones in the world. Meanwhile, service has set an all-time record with $20.9 billion in revenue for the March quarter. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and Payment Services. And now with more than 975 million paid subscriptions, we're reaching even more people with our lineup of services. Apple TV Plus continues to draw praise from customers and reviewers alike. During the past quarter, fans tuned in to incredible new series like Shrinking and The Big Door Prize, and got to welcome Ted Lasso back into their homes for a third season. Movies like Tetris are captivating viewers with many more to come, including Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon later this year. Three years since its launch, Apple TV Plus programming has been celebrated across the globe with over 1,450 nominations and more than 350 wins. Recently, we were thrilled to cheer on the Boy, the Mole, the Fox, and the Horse, which won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. The first season of our historic 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer is well underway. With MLS season pass, we've created the ultimate destination for soccer fans, offering subscribers the ability to watch every match with no blackouts. And with baseball season in full swing, Apple TV Plus subscribers can watch their favorite teams with a return of Friday Night Baseball. This quarter, we launched Apple Music Classical, a stand-alone app that gives something special to classical music lovers. Apple Music Classical packs the largest library of classical music on Earth into a thoughtful and intuitive design that strikes all the right notes. Whether you're listening with AirPods or HomePod, The premium sound experience of Apple Music Classical will leave you with a feeling of being front row at the symphony, just behind the conductor. In March, we also launched Apple Pay Later. Designed with users' privacy and financial health in mind, Apple Pay Later allows users to split purchases into multiple payments with no interest or fees. And last month, we introduced Apple Card Savings accounts to give users even more value out of their daily cash Apple Card benefit. At Apple, our customers are at the center of everything we do. Nowhere is that more evident than retail, where our teams are dedicated to sharing the best of Apple with our customers. And we're constantly innovating to deliver exceptional experiences and meet our customers where they are. In the U.S., we launched Shop with a Specialist over video A new way for customers to learn about iPhone and find the one that's just right for them. And as I noted earlier, in a milestone for Apple, we just opened our first two Apple stores in India, in Mumbai and Delhi. I was there to see it for myself, and I couldn't have been more delighted by the excitement and enthusiasm of the customers, developers, creatives, and team members I got to spend time with. I've had the chance to connect with customers and teams all around the world in recent months. So many people shared with me that they were fans of Apple, not just because of the innovations we create, but because of the values that guide us. And that means a great deal to us. We're constantly striving to make a positive difference in people's lives and be a force for progress. We're investing in education to give students the skills they need to shape the future. We're helping to create pathways of opportunity for communities of color through our racial equity and justice initiative. And every day, we're building an even more inclusive and diverse apple rooted in our culture of belonging. To better understand how our work intersects with our values, look no further than what we're doing for the environment. We just celebrated Earth Day in April, and during that month, Apple announced that its global manufacturing partners now support over 13 gigawatts of renewable energy, a nearly 30% increase in just the last year. This translates to 17.4 million metric tons of avoided carbon emissions, the equivalent of removing nearly 3.8 million cars from the road. We're also investing up to an additional $200 million and our Restore Fund, which is designed to support innovative, scalable, nature-based carbon removal projects with the goal of removing 1 million metric tons of carbon every year. These are just the latest steps on our journey toward our 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across our supply chain and lifecycle of our devices. At the same time, we're advancing renewable energy across our supply chain We're also sourcing more recycled materials in our products. Last month, we announced our plans to have all Apple-designed batteries include 100% certified recycled cobalt by 2025. And we remain committed to one day using only recycled and renewable materials in our products. We have a deep sense of mission here at Apple. We believe in the power of innovation to build a better world. We are determined to do our best work on behalf of our customers and to give them the tools that can enrich lives. So we will manage for the long term, just as we always have, with our eyes to the horizon, with limitless creativity, and with a deep belief that we can achieve anything we put our minds to. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca. Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $94.8 billion, down 3% from last year and better than our expectations. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over 5 percentage points on our results in line with what we had expected. On a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year over year in total and in the majority of the markets we track. In addition to the records in emerging markets that Tim mentioned, we also set March quarter records in Australia, Canada, Spain, and Switzerland, among others. Products revenue was $73.9 billion, down 5% from last year, due to challenging compares on Mac and iPad. iPhone, however, reached a March quarter revenue record thanks to very strong performance in emerging markets from South Asia and India, to Latin America and the Middle East. During the quarter, our installed base of active devices continued to grow at a nice pace, thanks to extremely high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, and reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments. Our services set an all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year, on top of growing 17% in the March quarter a year ago. We reached an all-time services revenue record in Greater China and March quarter records in Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Company gross margin was 44.3%, up 130 basis points from last quarter, driven by cost savings and favorable mixed shift towards services, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.7%, decreasing 30 basis points sequentially due to seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 71%, up 20 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses of $13.7 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and continued to decelerate from the December quarter. We are closely managing our spend but remain focused on long-term growth. We continue the investment in innovation and product development. Net income was $24.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.52 unchanged versus last year. And we generated very strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue set a March quarter record of $51.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year, despite significant foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging microeconomic environment. We set March quarter records in several developed and emerging markets, with India, Indonesia, Turkey, and the UAE doubling on a year-over-year basis. Our active installed base of iPhone grew to a new all-time high and was up in all our geographic segments. We're very pleased by the results of the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research, which measured customer satisfaction at 99% for the iPhone 14 family. Macro revenue was $7.2 billion, down 31% year-over-year, and in line with our expectations. These results were driven by the challenging macroeconomic environment, coupled with a difficult compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined M1 MacBook Pros. Despite this, the install base of ActiveMacs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, and we continue to see strong upgraded activity to Apple Silicon. Also, the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research reported customer satisfaction at 96% for Mac. iPad generated $6.7 billion in revenue, down 13% year-over-year, and in line with our expectations. This performance was due to two key factors, a tough compare against the launch of iPad Air, powered by the M1 chip in the year-ago quarter, and headwinds from the macroeconomic environment. The iPad install base reached a new all-time high in all geographic segments thanks to exceptional customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue was $8.8 billion, down 1% year over year, as the category experienced the impact from the macroeconomic environment. However, we did set March quarter records both in the U.S. and in Greater China. We continue to see strength in our watch install base which set a new all-time record thanks to very high customer loyalty and new-to rates. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to services, we reached a new all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion, and in addition to the all-time records Tim mentioned earlier, we set March quarter records for advertising, AppleCare, and video. Despite these records, as we saw in recent quarters, Certain services offerings, such as digital advertising and mobile gaming, continue to be affected by the current macroeconomic environment. Stepping back, however, the continued growth in services is the reflection of our ecosystem strength and the positive momentum we're seeing across several key metrics. First, our growing installed base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem. We continue to grow across every major product category and geographic segment thanks to very high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction. Second, we saw increased customer engagement with our services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year over year, each setting a new all-time record. Third, paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We now have more than 975 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months, and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services offerings, from new content on Apple TV+, to great new features available in Apple Pay and Apple Music, which we believe our customers will love. Turning to the enterprise market, we see business customers continuing to invest in the Apple platform to drive higher employee productivity and satisfaction. In Brazil, Boticario Group, the world's largest cosmetics franchisor, originally started with iPhone to help employees manage operations across a network of retail stores, franchisees, and resellers. As it continues to digitize its business, Boticario has chosen to move all software development in-house and adopted Mac as the standard device for all of their developer teams across the world. In small business, we see an increasing number of customers relying on Apple hardware, software, and services to power their businesses forward, from accepting payments on iPhone to tracking inventory on Mac or iPad to managing employee devices with Apple Business Essentials. As we celebrate National Small Business Week here in the U.S., we are proud to continue supporting the small business community. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by about $300 million, leaving us with total debt of $110 billion. Net cash was $57 billion at the end of the quarter. During the March quarter, we returned over $23 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19.1 billion through open market repurchases of 129 million Apple shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today our board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral over time. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.24 a share, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suassini referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the March quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. For an exchange, we continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of nearly four percentage points. For services, we expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the March quarter, while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. We expect gross margin to be between 44 and 44.5 percent. We expect OPEX to be between 13.6 and 13.8 billion dollars. We expect OINE to be around negative 250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments. and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, reflecting the dividend increase I mentioned earlier, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of 24 cents per share of common stock, payable on May 18, 2023, to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions. Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please? Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Eric Woodring of Morgan Stanley. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Tim, maybe if we start with you, if we go back to the December quarter and the shutdowns, the production shutdowns around the time, I think the question a lot of us were asking was, How should we think about the deferral of demand versus destruction of demand? You know, March quarter was quite strong, 2% year-over-year iPhone growth. And so as we sit here in May, you know, how have you seen customers that weren't able to purchase during the December quarter behave? Meaning, are you seeing that they deferred purchases to March and June? Could they be deferring purchases to later in hopes of buying a new iPhone? Just how should maybe we think about the cadence of that? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Yes. Hi, Eric. It's hard to quantify this, but we do believe we did recapture some amount of sales in the March quarter, as we did see the iPhone performance accelerate relative to the December quarter. The production levels for the whole quarter were where we wanted them to be, so supply was not an issue during Q2. Okay. Perfect. Thank you for that color. And Tim, maybe to follow up, you know, it's been three or four quarters now that you've mentioned emerging markets like India and others. And I imagine having just opened two new stores in the country, it's clearly an important market for you. So maybe can you just talk about why you see India as such an important market and others? how you think about monetization trends in the country, and specifically what you have to do within the country to really ensure that India becomes maybe a more material mix of your business. And that's it for me. Thanks so much. Yeah, sure. Looking at the business in India, we did set a quarterly record and grew very strong double digits year over year. So it was quite a good quarter for us. Taking a step back, India is an incredibly exciting market. It's a major focus for us. I was just there, and the dynamism in the market, the vibrancy is unbelievable. Over time, we've been expanding our operations there to serve more customers, and three years ago, we launched the Apple Store online, and then, as you just mentioned, we launched two stores just a few weeks ago and they're off to a great start, one in Mumbai and one in Delhi. We've got a number of channel partners in the country as well that we're partnering with and we're very happy with how that's going. Overall, I couldn't be more delighted and excited by the enthusiasm I'm seeing for the brand there. There are a lot of people coming into the middle class and I really feel that India is at a tipping point and it's great to be there. On other emerging markets, we had a stellar quarter in emerging markets overall, as I've mentioned. with records set in a number of different places, including Indonesia and Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, UAE, and then quarterly records in Brazil, India, and Malaysia. And so it was a great quarter for emerging markets in general, despite the headwinds of the currency that Luca mentioned. And so we're putting efforts in a number of these markets and really see, particularly given our low share and the dynamics of the demographics, et cetera, a great opportunity for us in those markets. Thanks, Eric. Can we have the next question, please? Our next question is from Mike Ng of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. It was encouraging to hear about the record install base across iPhone and across all devices. It's been, I think, double-digit growth over the last few years across the active devices. I was just wondering, is that a good way to think about the install base growth going forward? And then for the iPhone install base specifically, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit of texture around how you think about the growth there, whether regionally or by first smartphones versus switchers? And then I have a quick follow-up. Yeah, if you look at the install base of active devices now, overall, it's more than 2 billion. As you know, we announced in January that we surpassed that. And this quarter, our Q2, rather, we set new records across each of the geographic segments and each of the major product categories. And that's despite declines in current quarter sales, in particular in Mac and iPad. This is a huge asset for us, and it's a testament to the overall customer satisfaction and engagement and loyalty of our customers. And so we view this as a major asset for us. The iPhone base is well over a billion active devices. We see this as upgrade rates and these sorts of things may change quarter to quarter depending upon macroeconomic, but if you back up and look at the install base, we feel great about the size of it and the rate that it's growing. Great. Excellent. It was also encouraging to see the number of devices per iPhone user continue to grow. I was just wondering if you could talk about the opportunity to continue to increase that number of Apple devices per iPhone user. And if you have any color around how the monetization per user may differ from those, for lack of a better word, super users versus those that may not be as deep into the ecosystem. Thanks. We try really hard to design our products in such a way that they work seamlessly together. And so whether that's the watch or the Mac and so that you can start working on one device and finish it on the other. And so there are a good deal of people out there that have multiple Apple devices. And I think this is a testament to the customer satisfaction and loyalty that we've been able to get from the incredible design that our engineering teams do on our products. Excellent. Thank you, Tim. Thanks, Michael. Operator, can we have the next question, please? Our next question is from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse. Thank you very much. Thank you for taking my question. Tim, can you talk a bit about AI? Obviously, more than the topic of the day, it seems like the topic of the year. Just how do you think about it through your products and services? I know you use it in different ways. But also, if you can just give us any thoughts you have on generative AI and And I don't know where you see it going, not sure what you want to say on it, but I'm really curious as to your take. Thank you. Yeah, thanks for the question, Shannon. As you know, we don't comment on product roadmaps. I do think it's very important to be deliberate and thoughtful in how you approach these things. And there's a number of issues that need to be sorted as is being talked about in a number of different places. But the potential is certainly very interesting. And we've obviously made enormous progress integrating AI and machine learning throughout our ecosystem. And we weaved it into products and features for many years, as you probably know. You can see that in things like fall detection and crash detection and ECG. These things are not only great features, they're saving people's lives out there. And so it's absolutely remarkable. And so we view AI as huge and we'll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis. Okay, thank you. And then can you talk a bit about your shift of manufacturing and diversification of manufacturing footprint? I'm curious, obviously you have a very tight network in China, so how is it going to move to some of these other regions? Are you seeing any impact from a margin perspective or just any thoughts you have on what you've seen as you started to shift more and more outside of China, whether it's growth or it's actual production? Thank you. You know, our supply chain is truly global, and we're investing all over the world. We're investing in the U.S. We're investing in a number of other countries as well. And so we make products everywhere. We'll continue to invest everywhere. And we'll continue to look for ways to optimize the supply chain based on what we learn each and every day and week and so forth. to ensure that we can deliver the best products and services for our customers. If you sort of step back and look at how we've performed over the last three years on the supply chain, despite this parade of horribles, if you will, between the pandemic and the chip shortages and macroeconomic kind of factors, The supply chain has been incredibly resilient, and we feel good about what we are and what our plans are. Thank you. Thanks, Shannon. Operator, can we have the next question, please? Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you. Tim, you had called out on December quarter earnings that pro models were significantly constrained. Do you see a catch-up on the pro models specifically in the March quarter, and was the mix better than typical? And do you see that mix renormalizing here in the June quarter? And maybe you can comment on the channel inventory levels as well for iPhones, and I will follow up. Sure. It's hard to quantify, Wamsi, but we do believe we did recapture some amount of sales in the March quarter. And obviously we had to set the channel at the right levels, and we're very comfortable with the channel inventory that we have on a forward basis. So we do think there were some, but it's difficult to quantify it. Okay, thanks, Tim. And Tim, as a follow-up, you launched so many services around Apple Pay. Most recently, you mentioned Buy Now, Pay Later, High Yield Savings Account. Where do you see the expansion in the payments ecosystem over time? And do you look at the payments ecosystem as a standalone revenue opportunity, or is it more about making the devices even more inseparable from us? Thank you. What we're trying to do with our payments work is that sort of like we've done on the watch where we're focused on helping people live a healthier day on our financial products, we're helping people have a better financial health. And so things like the Apple Card and the fact that it has no fees, like the savings account, which has, as you mentioned, it's very attractive yield. Uh, so we're, we're trying to help our, our users and, uh, these, these things, but, uh, these things have to stand on their own, obviously. Uh, but we're, but we're very user focused. And so we're listening to them at what things are, provide them pinch points and, and orchestrate our, our roadmaps, uh, around that. Buy Now Pay Later, uh, is another one. you know, that we've just gotten out of the chute. But on the savings account specifically, we are very pleased with the initial response on it. It's been incredible. Thanks, Sam. Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, can we have the next question, please? Our next question is from David Vought of UBS. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Tim, I just wanted to go back to maybe kind of dig into, you know, the restocking of inventory in the channel versus what we're hearing from a demand perspective that appears to be a little bit softer in the March quarter from some of your larger carriers that exhibited relatively weak upgrade rates. So just want to kind of get a sense for where you're seeing demand signals today vis-a-vis how you were thinking about it maybe a month ago or even three months ago. And is there sort of an acceleration in demand or any sort of signals that you might want to share with us at this point and then I have a follow up? I don't want to go into what we're seeing in Q3 other than the guidance that Luca has given. But for Q2, I think you're probably referencing primarily U.S. carriers. And if you look at our geographic distribution of our performance, it was lower in the Americas, which is predominantly the United States. And a part of that is, I believe as macroeconomic apart, is that there were more promotional activity in the year ago quarter. And so I think that's what you're seeing there. Where our results were really stellar during this quarter was really in the emerging markets. And we couldn't be prouder of the results that we had there. Great. That's helpful. And then just quickly on services, are you seeing anything in terms of consumer's behavior other than sort of the macro that you mentioned and tough comps on digital advertising and mobile gaming. Are you seeing users of all the disparate services change and what they're using and how they're using it and time spent with an Apple service now that we're technically hopefully fully past COVID with China almost fully reopened? I'm just trying to get a sense for how user or consumer behavior has changed over the last three to six months. David, it's Luca. As you said, of course, we got the issue around the macroeconomic environment, particularly in advertising and in mobile gaming. But outside of those areas, the behavior of customers continues to be pretty consistent. We are doing particularly well, obviously, in some of the services that we've launched more recently, like payments, where our growth rates are very strong. as the adoption of Apple Pay and Apple Card and now the new services that Tim mentioned, the adoption continues to increase. Cloud is an area that continues to grow very consistently. Users want to store more photos and videos and more content on their devices, and so they adopt our cloud services. And in general, the model in the App Store around paid subscriptions continues to grow very strongly. I mentioned we now have more than 975 million paid subscriptions on the platform, and that's almost twice as much what we had only three years ago. So obviously the growth in subscriptions is very strong. Great. Thanks, Cass. All right. Thanks, David. Operator, can we have the next question, please? Our next question is from Sameek Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe I can follow up on David's question here on services. And in the past, pre-pandemic, the growth rate there was more about sort of mid-teens. the growth rates today where you stand, even if I back out, FX impact is more about low double digits. So one of the questions that we get often from investors and want to get your thoughts on is, even as the installed base growth seems to have accelerated, are these more cyclical drivers that are depressing growth at this point from returning to that level, or do you see more of a rollout on the monetization that you need to do to get back to those growth levels? And have a follow-up, please. Sameek, the areas where we are seeing the impact of the macro environment, as I mentioned, is digital advertising. As you know, obviously, the macro environment is not helping on that front. And mobile gaming, where we've seen a bit of a slowdown, partly due to the macro environment, partly due to the fact that we had very elevated usage during during the covid years but outside of those areas we continue to see very healthy growth rates okay and maybe if i can just follow up on this is more of a macro question i don't know if luca you or tim want to take this but um obviously the macro is not um sort of helpful at this point but what you're sort of implying in terms of your guide is momentum for your products remains pretty stable. You're actually getting to a modest uptake, XFX, for the overall business. I mean, what are you seeing in terms of customer sort of spending trends? And overall, does the consumer sort of continue to deteriorate in terms of spending patterns? And is your sort of momentum here just a function of share gains? How should we think about sort of where the consumer is versus what your products are doing independent of that? Part of it, Samik, is what Tim was talking about. We're having great momentum. in emerging markets. And those are markets where our share is low. It gives us a great opportunity to grow over time. It also helps us with the growth of the install base because you can imagine any places where our market share is low, we tend to add a lot of switchers, people that are new to the Apple ecosystem. That increases the install base and over the longer term, it obviously improves our ability to monetize on services as well. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Thanks, Samekh. Operator, can we have the next question, please? Our next question is from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. I have two as well. I guess first up on gross margins for the June quarter, they seem to be holding up fairly well, especially given the fact that sales are going down on a sequential basis. So, Luke, I'm wondering if you can just touch on what's driving the strength in gross margin sequence that's offsetting the lack of leverage, if you may. And then I also noticed that the range of your gross margin guide is 50 basis points. It's typically 100. What does that entail? What does that mean? So you're right. I mean, we are guiding to a fairly stable level of gross margins at a very high level. We're very happy with the gross margins that we're having this cycle. For the first time in several quarters, foreign exchange, we expect foreign exchange to be flat on a sequential basis at the gross margin level. Unfortunately, it's still a headwind. at the revenue level, but at gross margin level, sequentially, we expect foreign exchange not to be a factor. And so the seasonal loss of leverage that you're referring to, we expect to be offset by cost savings. And so that should give us that level of margins. As you know, you were asking about the 50 basis points. We have guided to 50 basis points of a range before as well. This year in particular, because of the 14th week during the December quarter, we're a bit late in the calendar year, right? And so we have a bit more visibility around margins for the June quarter. Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, Tim, if I just go back to the India discussion a bit, perhaps you could just contrast what you're seeing in India today versus what you saw in China maybe a decade or so ago. Is that a reasonable ramp to think India would have, or could it be different from the lessons you've seen in China? I think each country is different and has their own journey, and so I hesitate to compare too much. But what I do see in India is a lot of people entering the middle class, and I'm hopeful that we can convince some number of them to buy an iPhone. And we'll see how that works out. But right now, it's working out well. Thank you. Thanks, Amit. Operator, can we have the next question, please? Our next question is from Chris Sanker of TD Cohen. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first question I had is for Tim. Tim, you have primarily been a consumer-centric company, but it seems like the line is blurring with the iPhone, iPad, the hardware products being used for corporate applications. So is there a way to segment how much of your revenues today are coming from enterprise versus consumer? Does the slow corporate IT spend impact your outlook for iPhone, iPad, Mac, et cetera, and then add a follow-up? Internally, we have our estimates for how much is enterprise versus consumer. And the enterprise business is growing. have been focusing a lot on BYOD programs, and there's more and more companies that are leaning into those and giving employees the ability to select, which plays to our benefit, I believe, because I think a lot of people want to use a Mac at work or an iPad at work. but but we're certainly primarily a consumer company in terms of our revenues obviously got it thanks for that and then just as a follow-up you know obviously a lot of questions on the india retail opening i'm just kind of curious you also mentioned that you hope to convert a lot of uh you know folks into iphone there um where do you think the biggest opportunity is it like primarily a hardware business like the iphone ipad variables, et cetera, or do you think there is a service opportunity in India longer term too? Thank you very much. I think there's an opportunity across the board, including in services. Obviously the ARPUs are lower in India for what you're talking about. TV and movie streaming or music, the ARPUs are much lower than other regions. But if you look at it over a long arc of time, I think there's a good opportunity across the board. Thanks a lot, Tim. Yeah. Thanks, Krish. Operator, can we have the next question, please? Our next question is from Aaron Rutgers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first question is that I'm going to go back to kind of the geographical dynamics. I'm curious, you know, as we all think about, you know, the reopening attributes of China, just how you would characterize the shaping of demand you saw through the course of this last quarter and kind of how you're thinking about the impact of that reopening playing out over the next couple of quarters? If you look at China, our revenue came in at negative three for the quarter year over year, but we actually grew on a constant currency basis. And we also accelerated as compared to the December quarter, which, as you know, had 14 weeks in it and was a negative seven on a reported basis. And so we were pleased with how we did and with the acceleration that we saw with the reopening. And we'll see how we do this quarter. But if you look at the top selling smartphones in urban China, based on a survey from Kantar, we have four out of the top five. And I think in all of the third-party data I've seen on the market itself in the smartphone space, we believe we gain share during Q2. So we feel good about it. Also, China has a lot of very good metrics in terms of new buyers. For example, on the Mac, about six out of 10 customers are buying the Mac for the first time. Same thing on iPad. If you look over at the watch, it's more than three out of four customers are buying the watch for the first time. And so the buyer metrics, if you will, are very, very good. And our services business hit an all-time record in China during the quarter. Very helpful, Tim. As a quick follow-up, I want to go back to Ahmed's question on gross margin. You know, you talked about FX, you know, the lessening impact there. I'm just curious, you know, when you look at your gross margin, obviously you've got mixed attributes kind of, you know, potentially continuing to drive that higher. But I'm curious on the current environment how you would characterize the component pricing dynamics and what you're thinking about in this current quarter's guidance? Yeah, the environment on the component side is favorable. We've seen component prices decline during the March quarter, and we expect the same during the June quarter. Thank you. Thank you, Aaron. Operator, can we have the next question, please? Our next question is from Sydney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Great, thanks for taking my question. I was hoping we can talk about the linearity of the March quarter and perhaps the first four and a half weeks of the current quarter. It looks like things are slowing down quite a bit elsewhere, but if my math is right, your fiscal third quarter guidance implied product revenue will be a little bit lower than seasonal average on a sequential basis. Any color would be helpful. Thanks. We said that we expect our performance during the June quarter at the revenue level to be similar to the one that we just reported for the March quarter. Keep in mind, we always have differences in the launch timing across our products. And also that, you know, especially over the last few years, we've seen a certain amount of supply disruptions. Sometimes it was COVID related. Sometimes it was related to specific component shortages. Just to remind you, in the June quarter a year ago, we had the full quarter impact of the launch for both of the iPhone SE and the iPad Air. which leads to a more difficult compare. So I think it's important to keep those things in mind. Okay, that's helpful. Maybe a quick follow-up. You talk about Apple Pay Later. How has the feedback been so far, and how do you expect the adoption of that service over the next few quarters? Thank you. The feedback for both Apple Pay Later and the savings product have both been really good, and we think both of them help customers live a better or healthier financial life. And so we're very excited about the first days of both of them. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Sydney. Operator, can we have the last question, please? Our next question is from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Yeah, hey, guys. Thanks for screening me in. Tim, you're one of the largest chip companies. You're not a component maker. You actually use your own products. almost never hear in any context of you guys being a beneficiary, Apple being a beneficiary for either the CHIP Act money or the R&D tax credit that's being proposed. I was just curious if you're eligible for any of those and then I've got to follow up. I don't see Apple participating in the CHIPS Act directly, but we would be a beneficiary indirectly because some of our partners would hopefully be recipients of it and therefore put in additional capacity. And so on that sort of indirect basis, we would have a benefit. Understood, and thanks for clarification. Luca, I wanted to clarify your comments about June. When you're saying June performance will be similar to March, I assume on a year-on-year basis, June should be down about two-something odd percent. Is that a fair way? And then my question that I wanted to ask, maybe another one for Tim, was what do you think is the largest opportunity in your services offering? I mean, you're doing a great job. You just set a record, but surely there must be areas where you think you can do better. Yes, so to your question around the June performance, yes, on a year-over-year basis, so comparable to the March quarter on a year-over-year basis. Arsh, I think we can do better on everything. And so I wouldn't just point to one of them. If you look at the number of active devices And the growth of active devices, I think our services are underpenetrated in a number of different ways. And so the way that I look at it is there's opportunity in many of them. Understood. Thanks, Tim. Yep. All right. Thank you, Harsh.

Today we're reporting revenue of $117.2 billion for the December quarter. We set all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, Spain, Turkey, and Vietnam, along with quarterly records in Brazil and India. As a result of a challenging environment, our revenue was down 5% year over year. But I'm proud of the way we have navigated circumstances seen and unforeseen over the past several years, and I remain incredibly confident in our team, in our mission, and in the work we do every day. Let me discuss the three factors that impacted our revenue performance during the quarter. The first was foreign exchange headwinds, which had a nearly 800 basis point impact. On a constant currency basis, we grew year over year and would have grown in the vast majority of the markets we track. The second factor, which we described in a November 6th update, was COVID-19-related challenges, which significantly impacted the supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and lasted through most of December. Because of these constraints, we had significantly less iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max supply than we planned, causing ship times to extend far beyond what we had anticipated. As we always have every step of the way throughout the pandemic, we continue to prioritize people and work with our suppliers to ensure the health and safety of every worker. Production is now back where we want it to be. The third factor was a challenging macroeconomic environment as the world continues to face unprecedented circumstances from inflation to war in Eastern Europe to the enduring impacts of the pandemic. And we know that Apple is not immune to it. But whatever conditions we face, our approach is always the same. We are thoughtful and deliberate. We manage for the long term. We adapt quickly to circumstances outside our control while delivering with excellence in the things we can. We invest in innovation, in people, and in the positive difference we can make in the world. And we do it all to provide our customers with technology that will enrich their lives and help unlock their full creative potential. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of, and it's so rewarding for all of us at Apple when we hear how much our customers are loving what we create. Let me talk now about what we saw across our product categories. Starting with iPhone, revenue came in at $65.8 billion for the quarter, down 8% year over year. However, on a constant currency basis, iPhone revenue was roughly flat. Our customers continue to rave about the astounding camera capabilities and unprecedented battery life and the groundbreaking suite of health and safety features. The iPhone 14 lineup pushes the limits of what users can do with a smartphone. During the quarter, Mac revenue came in at $7.7 billion, which was in line with what we had expected. We had a difficult compare because this time last year we had the extremely successful launch of the redesigned M1 MacBook Pros. We also faced a challenging macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange headwinds. We remain confident in and focused on the long-term opportunity for Mac. Just last month, we introduced new MacBook Pro models powered by our latest developments in Apple silicon, M2 Pro and M2 Max. These chips enable unprecedented performance and do so with less energy, which is not only good for the environment, but gives the newest MacBook Pro the longest battery life ever in a Mac. We also introduced the M2-powered Mac Mini, which will supercharge productivity for users of all kinds and leave them stunned by just how powerful a Mac Mini can be. During the quarter, iPad revenue grew 30% to a total of $9.4 billion. The very strong growth was due in part to a favorable compare to the December quarter a year ago when we experienced significant supply constraints. Customers continue to praise our new lineup for its versatility, whether it's the new iPad Pro, now powered by the M2, or the newly designed iPad 10th generation with its stunning liquid retina display and beautiful colors. Revenue for wearables, home, and accessories was $13.5 billion, which was down 8% year over year, driven by foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in the category. As an example, a few weeks ago, we announced the Next Generation HomePod, which is an indispensable addition to the smart home. This powerful smart speaker relies on advanced computational audio to produce an incredible listening experience. We're also helping users make their home safer with sound recognition. This feature, arriving later this spring, allows HomePod to send a notification directly to a user's iPhone if a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm sound is identified. We continue to hear wide praise for Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra, which has set a new standard for what's possible with a wearable. From a whole host of health and safety features to incredible new capabilities for extreme athletes, there is something for everyone in these amazing products. Customers are excited about some phenomenal new features we've made available across many of our products as well. One of the highlights is emergency SOS via satellite, which launched for iPhone 14 customers in the US and Canada in November, and for customers in France, Germany, Ireland, and the UK in December. This is a feature we hope our users will never need, but it is incredibly heartening to get emails from people describing the life-saving impact our new safety features have had on them. We're always looking for new ways to empower people to create and collaborate. In December, we released Freeform, a brand new app that lets users take their ideas wherever they want, anywhere they are, all while collaborating in real time. Freeform has already received praise from reviewers for its flexibility and simplicity as it works seamlessly across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Today, we are very excited to announce that we've achieved a truly incredible milestone. Thanks to our deep commitment to innovation, incredible customer loyalty and satisfaction, and a large number of switchers, we now have more than 2 billion active devices as part of our growing installed base, double what it was just seven years ago. This is an incredible testament to our products and services and the strength of our ecosystem. We set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion in services, which was better than what we had expected. We achieved double-digit revenue growth from App Store subscriptions and set all-time revenue records across a number of categories, including cloud and payment services. All told, Apple now has more than 935 million paid subscriptions. Apple has also just begun a historic 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer. Just yesterday, we launched MLS Season Pass, which will give fans in more than 100 countries access to every live MLS regular season game, as well as the playoffs and MLS Cup, all with no blackouts. And while we're providing more content to sports fans than ever before, Apple TV Plus continues to showcase powerful characters and moving storytelling. We were thrilled to celebrate the holidays alongside our Apple TV Plus subscribers with the hit movie Spirited, and we're delighted to see how much people are enjoying new and returning series like Shrinking, Slow Horses, and Truth Be Told. and we have some great upcoming movies in Sharper and Tetris, along with Emmy Award winner Ted Lasso returning this spring. During the quarter, we made some great updates to Fitness Plus as well, expanding our catalog of more than 3,500 workouts and meditations to include a new kickboxing category and a new sleep theme for meditations. Our latest artist spotlight series features the music of the incomparable Beyonce, and we're excited to take a stroll with guests appearing on our fifth season of Time to Walk. And we continue to build on our decades-long commitment to helping small businesses thrive when we announced Apple Business Connect. This new tool gives business owners even more control over how billions of people see and engage with their products and services every day. Businesses of all sizes can now customize key information for users across Apple Maps, Messages, Wallet, Siri, and other apps. Meanwhile, in retail, we celebrated 25 years of the Apple online store and also opened Apple Pacific Center in Vancouver and Apple American Dream in New Jersey. And I'm grateful to all the teams who helped our customers throughout the busy holiday season. At Apple, we spend a lot of time focused on creating an unparalleled experience for our customers in every product and service that we offer. We're also just as dedicated to leading with our values in everything we do. As part of that work, we strengthened our deep commitment to privacy and security, giving users three new tools to protect their most sensitive data. iMessage contact key verification, security keys for Apple ID, and advanced data protection for iCloud. At Apple, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to leave the world better than we found it. We're also a year closer to 2030, and we remain ever focused on the environmental commitments we set out for the end of the decade. As an example, the latest Mac Mini and MacBook Pro models all use 100% recycled aluminum in the enclosure and recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. And in a first for HomePod, we're using 100% recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards. In honor of Black History Month, we released the Black Unity Collection, including the special edition Apple Watch Black Unity Sport Loop, a new matching watch face, and iPhone wallpaper. Through our racial equity and justice initiative, we're expanding our support of five organizations focused on lifting up communities of color through technology. And we are committed, as ever, to building on our progress around inclusion and diversity. During the quarter, we also announced that since the inception of our giving program 11 years ago, we've donated more than $880 million to humanitarian efforts, disaster relief, childhood education, and more. And over the last 16 years through our partnership with REDD, Apple supported grants have helped more than 11 million people get the care and support services they need. As we look ahead in 2023, we are excited about the year to come. At Apple, we are always looking forward, always focused on the next challenge, always determined to do great things with unmatched creativity and unrivaled innovation. And that makes me more confident about the future of Apple than I have ever been. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk05', 'text': \"Thank you Tim, and good afternoon everyone. As Tim mentioned, revenue for the December quarter was $117.2 billion, down 5% from last year. A number of factors had a significant impact on our results. First, we faced a very difficult foreign exchange environment, which affected our performance by nearly 800 basis points. In other words, we grew revenue on a constant currency basis, and in fact, we did so in the vast majority of markets. Second, the macroeconomic environment this past quarter was markedly more challenging than 12 months ago. Third, we experienced significant supply shortages for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in November and through December. On the other hand, we had the positive impact of the 14th week in the quarter that Tejas mentioned at the beginning of the call. Products revenue was 96.4 billion, down 8% from last year due to the factors I just called out. At the same time, however, our installed base of active devices grew double digits and achieved all-time records in each geographic segment and in each major product category. We are proud to now have over 2 billion active devices in our installed base. This continued growth in the installed base is due to extremely strong levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products. The installed base growth also helped our services set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion, up 6% over a year ago. We achieved this new milestone despite more than 700 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We reached all-time services revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific, and a December quarter record in Greater China. We also set records in many services categories, including all-time revenue records for cloud services, payment services, and music, and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. Company gross margin was 43%, up 70 basis points from last quarter, due to leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 37%, up 240 basis points sequentially, and services gross margin was 70.8%, up 30 basis points sequentially, both due to the same factors that impacted total company gross margin. Operating expenses of 14.3 billion were significantly below the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter, and grew at a slower pace than in the past, as we took actions to respond to the current macro environment. Net income was 30 billion, diluted earnings per share were $1.88, and we generated very strong operating cash flow of 34 billion. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $65.8 billion, despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, supply constraints on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, and a challenging microeconomic environment. In spite of these circumstances, we set all-time iPhone revenue records in Canada, Italy, and Spain, and saw strong growth in several emerging markets, including all-time iPhone revenue records for India and Vietnam. Importantly, the installed base of active iPhones continues to grow nicely and is at an all-time high across all geographic segments. In emerging markets in particular, the installed base grew double digits, and we had record levels of switchers in India and in Mexico. Our customers continue to love their experience with our products, with the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 14 family. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, down 29% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. There were three key drivers for our Mac results. First, we had a challenging compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined MacBook Pros, our first notebooks with M1 Pro and M1 Macs. Second, we believe that the macro environment impacted our Mac performance. And third, we faced significant foreign exchange headwinds. At the same time, however, the installed base of active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments. And we continue to see very strong upgraded activity to Apple Silicon. Customer satisfaction with Mac remains very strong at 96% based on the latest survey of US consumers from 451 research. iPad revenue was $9.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year, despite significant FX headwinds. This performance was driven by two key items. First, during the December quarter a year ago, we experienced significant supply constraints, while this year we had enough supply to meet demand. Second, we launched our new iPad and the iPad Pro powered by the M2 chip during the quarter. The iPad install base reached a new all-time high thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue was $13.5 billion, down 8% year over year. The year-over-year decline was driven by significant FX headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our installed base of devices in the category set a new all-time record thanks to the largest number of customers new to a smartwatch that we've ever had in a given quarter. In fact, nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to services, we generated $20.8 billion in revenue, a new all-time record in total and for many services offerings, in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment, and macroeconomic headwinds impacting certain categories such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. In constant currency, we grew services revenue double digits on top of growing 24% during the December quarter a year ago. We remain focused on the large long-term opportunity in this category, and we continue to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem. For example, we saw increased customer engagement with our services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year over year, each setting a new all-time record. Paid subscriptions also continue to grow nicely. We now have more than 935 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up more than 150 million during the last 12 months alone, and nearly four times what we had just five years ago. and we continue to increase the reach and improve the quality of our offerings. For instance, Apple Pay is now available to millions of merchants in nearly 70 countries and regions, and we saw a record-breaking number of purchases made using Apple Pay globally during the holiday shopping season. Finally, our installed base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem. And it continues to grow even during difficult macroeconomic conditions, which speaks to the exceptionally high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction and our ability to attract new customers to our platform. The growth is coming from every major product category and geographic segment, with strong double-digit increases in emerging markets, such as Brazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Turning to the enterprise market, we are seeing continued adoption of our services for business. like Apple Business Essentials, AppleCare, Tap2Pay, and Apple Financial Services. For example, Mars Incorporated has expanded its use of AppleCare for Enterprise to provide timely device support and assurance for iPads deployed across their manufacturing sites. Meanwhile, HCA Healthcare has leveraged Apple Financial Services to manage the annual refresh of its entire fleet of iPhones. This not only ensures that their staff stay current on the latest Apple technology, but also provides them with significant annual savings in the process. Let me now turn to our capital return program and our cash position. We returned over $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter as our business continues to generate very strong cash flow. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19 billion through open market repurchases of 133 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with $165 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1.4 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8.2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $54 billion at the end of the quarter, and we maintain our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time. As we move into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the microeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. In total, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the December quarter. This represents an acceleration in our underlying year-over-year business performance as the December quarter benefited from an extra week. For an exchange, we'll continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of five percentage points. For services, we expect revenue to grow year-over-year, while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. For iPhone, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to accelerate relative to the December quarter year-over-year revenue performance. For Mac and iPad, we expect revenue for both product categories to decline double digits year-over-year because of challenging compares and macroeconomic headwinds. We expect gross margin to be between 43.5% and 44.5%. We expect OPEX to be between $13.7 and $13.9 billion. We expect OINE to be around negative $100 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of 23 cents per share of common stock, payable on February 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk07', 'text': 'Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?'}, {'speaker': 'spk12', 'text': 'Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from David Bott with UBS.'}, {'speaker': 'spk10', 'text': \"Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. So, Tim, and maybe this is for Luca as well, you talked about the supply chain returning back to normal after a very difficult October-November, but we're still seeing some disruptions across tech products, whether it's enterprise or consumer-facing. How do you think about your supply chain and maybe the levels of inventory or bills that you might need as we go forward to sort of insulate your business from these sort of episodic disruptions? Have you changed your view? And if so, how does that affect ultimately margins and sort of your balance sheet and cash flow items going forward? Thanks.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': \"This is Tim, David. From a supply point of view, we did see disruption from early November through most of December. And from a supply chain point of view, We're now at a point where production is what we need it to be, and so the problem is behind us. In terms of going forward in the supply chain, we build our products everywhere. There are component parts coming from many different countries in the world and the final assembly coming from from three countries in the world on just iPhone. And so we continue to optimize it. We'll continue to optimize it over time and change it to continue to improve. I think when you sort of zoom out and back up from it, the last three years have been a pretty difficult time between COVID and silicon shortages and the like, and I think we have had a very resilient supply chain in the aggregate. In terms of supply for this quarter, which I think was one of your points, I think we're in decent supply on most products for the quarter currently.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk13', 'text': 'Great, thank you.'}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': 'Yeah.'}, {'speaker': 'spk07', 'text': 'Great. Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?'}, {'speaker': 'spk12', 'text': 'Our next question is from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse.'}, {'speaker': 'spk11', 'text': \"Thank you very much. Luca, I wanted to dig a bit more into the commentary on gross margin. The guidance, especially 43.5 to 44.5 is obviously quite strong. So I'm wondering what's helping you out there? some mix and some other things. And then, you know, how should we think about what currency and hedging is going to do as we look forward? And then I have a follow-up.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk05', 'text': \"Shannon? Yes, I mean, we've had good margin for the December quarter to start with. We reported 43%. Obviously, in December, we have the benefit of leverage because of the seasonality of the business. But we also had favorable mix across the board. Of course, foreign exchange is an issue right now. In the December quarter, on a sequential basis, foreign exchange was a negative 110 basis points for us. And on a year-over-year basis, it's 300 basis points. So obviously, the FX environment has changed a lot during the last 12 months. For March, yeah, we've seen a margin expansion, 43.5% to 44.5%. We're doing a lot of work around cost, of course, you know, mix will continue to help both within categories and services mix as we move away from the holiday season. But we're doing a lot of work on the cost structure, and that is paying off. Foreign exchange is still a negative, about 50 basis points sequentially, but it's mitigating. The last couple of weeks, the dollar has weakened a bit. And so hopefully, as we go through the year, hopefully things will improve. But for now, as you correctly state, we are in a good position on margins.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk11', 'text': \"Thank you. And then, Tim, can you talk a bit about China, what you're seeing? Obviously, you had the issues with production, but I mean more on the demand side. As we've gotten through Chinese New Year and the opening, I'm just wondering, are you seeing the Chinese consumer come back? What are they buying, and how are you thinking about your position there? Thank you.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': \"Shannon, last quarter, we declined by 7% on a reported basis, but we actually grew on a constant currency basis. And that was despite some significant of the supply constraints that we talked about earlier. And obviously the sort of the COVID restrictions throughout China that happened in various different places throughout the country, uh also impacted the the demand during the quarter uh when you look at uh the opening that started happening in december we saw a marked change in traffic in our stores as compared to november and that followed through to demand as well and I don't want to get into January. We've obviously for January is included in the guidance or the color rather that Luca provided earlier. But we did see a marked change from December compared to November.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk12', 'text': 'Thank you.'}, {'speaker': 'spk07', 'text': 'Yeah. Great. Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?'}, {'speaker': 'spk12', 'text': 'Our next question is from Eric Woodring of Morgan Stanley.'}, {'speaker': 'spk08', 'text': \"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Tim, first one for you. That $2 billion device install base figure, that's up, I believe, 200 million units year over year. That implies the strongest annual gain in new devices. And your install base is basically as far back as you've provided those data points. And so I guess my two questions are, one, can you provide the install base for the iPhone at year-end? And then two, is there anything that you see in this new cohort of users that might look different or similar to past cohorts, either by demographic or regions or monetization ramp? And then I will follow up. Thanks.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': \"Yeah, the install base is now over 2 billion active devices, as you mentioned. And we set records across each geographic segment and major product category. And so it was a broad-based change. To correct one thing you said, it's up over 150 million year over year. The last report we reported to be over 1.85. And so it's 150, which we're very proud of. We also saw strong double digit in several of the emerging markets, which is very important to us. For example, India and Brazil as just two examples. So very, very strong and obviously it bodes well for the future.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk08', 'text': \"Great. Thank you for the color, Tim. And then, you know, Luca, obviously the December quarter was negatively impacted by the production challenges. Can you just maybe unpackage where channel inventory levels are today kind of across the iPhone broadly? And then, you know, what the data that you're seeing so far this quarter is telling you about iPhone demand deferral versus kind of iPhone demand destruction and perhaps pushing some upgrades later into the year rather than into March quarter? And that's it for me. Thanks.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': \"Yeah, Eric, I'll take that one as well. The channel inventory levels on iPhone, we obviously ended the December quarter below our target range, given the supply challenges on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. But as you think about this, keep in mind that a year ago, we also exited the December quarter below our target inventory range. because of supply challenges in the year-ago quarter. Not related, not the same issue by, just as a point. And so that hopefully gives you some flavor of that. In terms of what we're seeing in January, we've included In our color that Luca provided, kind of our thinking, it's very hard to estimate the recapture because you have to know exactly what would have happened and how many people bought down, and it takes a while to get those reports. in during the quarter. And so we've made our best guess at it. In terms of the sizing of the constraint in Q1, what we estimate, although not with precision, is that we would, I thought we believe iPhone would have grown during the quarter had it not been for the supply shortages. So hopefully that provides you a little bit of color.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk08', 'text': \"Yep, that's great. Thanks so much.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk07', 'text': 'Thanks, Eric. Can we have the next question, please?'}, {'speaker': 'spk12', 'text': 'Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.'}, {'speaker': 'spk02', 'text': \"Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I have two as well, if I can. I guess the first kind of question, just going back on the gross margin line, you know, pretty good guidance into this March quarter. I'm curious if you unpack that a little bit, specific around what you're seeing as far as, you know, maybe benefits from component pricing.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk05', 'text': \"um you know in in the guidance uh if you're embedding any of that at this point yeah of course you know with our guidance we try to capture every aspect uh of our cost structure and obviously components are a big portion of that yeah so definitely that's that's included and keep in mind again that Foreign exchange, I mentioned earlier, I think to Shannon, that the sequential negative on FX is 50 basis points versus a year ago, it's 270 basis points. Obviously, the US dollar has moved a lot over the last 12 months. So obviously, we need to find offsets and more to the negative FX in order to be able to provide this kind of guidance. And so obviously, components are a big part of that.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk02', 'text': \"Yep. And then kind of, you know, from a strategic perspective, given kind of the things that we're seeing out in some of your peer group, I'm curious, Tim, how you think about, you know, the role of AI in your strategy as far as particularly in the services segment, whether you see opportunities to excel monetization abilities within the paid subscriber base and whether or not AI is something that you're implementing a bit more strategically there.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': \"Yeah, it is a major focus of ours. It's incredible in terms of how it can enrich customers' lives. And you can look no further than some of the things that we announced in the fall with crash detection and fall detection. or back aways with ECG. I mean, these things have literally saved people's lives. And so we see an enormous potential in this space to affect virtually everything we do. It's obviously a horizontal technology, not a vertical. And so it will affect every product and every service that we have.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk07', 'text': 'Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?'}, {'speaker': 'spk12', 'text': 'Certainly. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.'}, {'speaker': 'spk03', 'text': \"Thanks for taking my question. Yes, the first one I have is, Tim, I think basically earlier comments that iPhones would have grown X the production issue would imply that maybe it's a $7 billion or so impact that you had in December quarter from the production challenges on the high-end models. I'm sure it's tough to see what happens this summer round, but I think historically when you've had production issues or things like this happen, what has the consumer behavior been typically? Do they tend to go down towards the lower-end models and get the phone they want quickly, or do they just defer their production? Just from a historical perspective, I think. Do you typically recover what's deferred out, or no?\"}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': \"It's very hard to estimate is the real answer because you have to know a lot of data and it's usually only in hindsight that you have a more reasonable view of it. And so we put our best views in the color that Luca provided. That's kind of what I would say.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk03', 'text': \"All right. And then, you know, I guess maybe if I think about services as you go forward, and, you know, you've had really good growth in services, I think, over the last several years, but as you go forward in services, you know, what do you think drives the growth more so? Is it the expansion of your install base, or is it more going to be driven by, you know, our pool going higher for you? I'm just curious, how do you think about those two buckets as you go forward?\"}, {'speaker': 'spk05', 'text': \"I mean, there's a number of things, and I mentioned a few of them during the call, but The first step is always the install base. The install base is the engine for services growth. And the fact that the install base is growing very nicely and it's growing, you know, in a lot of emerging markets is growing even faster. That gives us, you know, a larger addressable pool of customers. That's incredibly important. The second one is that we are seeing that the level of engagement of our customers already in our ecosystem continues to grow. I mentioned that both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits. And so that bodes very well for the future. And we have a lot of transacting accounts that can move to paid accounts over time. The other aspect that is very important for us is to continue constantly to improve the reach and the quality of our services. And I give the example of Apple Pay, which it's a great example because we started off primarily in the United States. Now we've taken it to 70 markets, millions of merchants. And so obviously payment services continue to set new highs all the time for us. And as you've seen over the last few years, we also launched new services over time, and that obviously contributes to the growth. We're very excited. And when we look at the behavior of our installed base, we think it's very promising for the continued growth of our services business.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk07', 'text': 'Perfect. Thank you. Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?'}, {'speaker': 'spk12', 'text': 'Our next question comes from harsh Kumar Piper Sandler.'}, {'speaker': 'spk13', 'text': \"Yeah. Hey, uh, Tim, I had a quick question on emerging markets. Uh, it seems like you're making a lot of strikes in India, uh, potentially wanted to understand the kind of share you have in China and India. And relative to that, what would be your aspirational, but sort of achievable share in iPhones in those territories, whether it's units or revenues, And I was hoping to draw on your experience with what you've seen in other countries where you've had some longer presence.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': \"And looking at the business in India, we set a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year over year. And so we feel very good about how we performed. And that's despite the headwinds that we've talked about. Taking a step back, India is a hugely exciting market for us and is a major focus. We brought the online store there in 2020. We will soon bring Apple retail there. So we're putting a lot of emphasis on the market. There's been a lot done from a financing options and trade-ins to make products more affordable and give people more options to buy. And so there's a lot going on there. We're in essence taking what we learned in China years ago and how we scaled China and bringing that to bear. And I don't have the exact market shares in front of me, but I think you would see that from a market share point of view that we grew around the world last quarter on iPhone, despite the challenges that we had on the supply side. And I wouldn't expect to have a difference in those two markets.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk13', 'text': \"Understood. And for my follow-up, I had sort of an interesting theoretical question on pricing. Assuming we get the CHIP Act passed and there's a whole bunch of manufacturing that happens in U.S. and other territories that are potentially somewhat more expensive than the ones you might be in now, has the company done any studies to gauge the elasticity of demand relative to small price increases in your products?\"}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': \"We have experience in that, but I wouldn't necessarily draw the same conclusion that you have in terms of the cost of the product. We don't know at this point exactly what that will be. We're all in in terms of being the largest customer for TSMC in Arizona and are very proud to take part in that. That's what I would say about that.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk13', 'text': 'Okay, fair enough. Thank you, Tim.'}, {'speaker': 'spk07', 'text': 'Yep. Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?'}, {'speaker': 'spk12', 'text': 'Sure. Our next question comes from Wamsi Moan of Bank of America.'}, {'speaker': 'spk04', 'text': \"Yes, thank you. Tim, you've done a phenomenal job of driving consumer choice towards higher-end products within your portfolio. How would you compare this cycle for iPhones if you were to segment the pro versus non-pro models versus the cycles from the past few years? And do you think this move to higher ASPs is sustainable, or do you think it reverses in a tighter consumer spending environment? I'll have a follow-up.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': \"The pro has been a 14 pro and the 14 pro max have done extremely well up until the point where we had a supply shortage and couldn't provide them, couldn't provide the total of the demand. And so it's definitely a strong pro cycle. I think there's a number of reasons for that, but the most important one is always the product. And I think the innovations in the product speak for themselves. And we feel very good about the product that we announced back in September and are happy to now be at a point where we're shipping to the demand.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk04', 'text': \"Tim, do you think that this move to sort of higher ASPs that has happened over the last few years is sustainable or could it sustain in this very tough macro environment that you've cited?\"}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': \"I wouldn't want to predict, but I would say that the smartphone for us, the iPhone, has become so integral into people's lives. It contains their contacts and their health information and their banking information and their smart home and so many different parts of their lives. It's their payment vehicle and for many people. And so I think people are willing to really stretch to get the best they can afford in that category.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk04', 'text': 'Okay, great. And, Tim, you clearly emphasize the focus and importance of the install base. If we think about the absolute grip of the install base from $1 billion to $2 billion over seven years from a device standpoint, how should we think about the penetration of services or the growth in paying customers on services over that time frame? Is that penetration rate increasing or decreasing, how fast is that growing relative to the growth of the overall install base?'}, {'speaker': 'spk05', 'text': \"It's Luca. And yes, of course, you know, we keep track of that. It's really, really important for us. Over the last seven years, as we've doubled the install base, we've seen a growing engagement of our customers on the platform. That happens, first of all, by customers transacting on the platform and then moving to paid accounts. So starting to pay for some of the services. uh that percentage of paid accounts tends to grow over time we've seen it in developed markets we see it in emerging markets and that is due to some of the reasons that i was explaining earlier including the fact that we made it easier for our for our customers to get engaged on the platform for example we offer multiple payment methods in in many countries uh and we've made it easier to explore for more services because we've added a lot of services on the platform over the last over the last seven years so to your question of course higher engagement means a higher percentage of paid accounts over time okay thank you all right thanks wamsi can we have the next question please\"}, {'speaker': 'spk12', 'text': 'Our next question comes from Richard Kramer of Crete Research, LLP.'}, {'speaker': 'spk07', 'text': 'Operator, can we move on to the next? Richard. Okay.'}, {'speaker': 'spk12', 'text': \"Next we'll hear from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Jim, your line is open. If you can release your mute function, we are unable to hear you.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk06', 'text': \"Tim and Luca, you both mentioned earlier on the Q&A a little bit about India. I was wondering if we're now entering a situation of even more opportunity because we've exited COVID, we've exited countries with different COVID criteria. We've also seen India build out its higher speed transmissions and your market shares tremendously underrepresented there. And it appears with the supply chain, you're looking at diversifying kind of operational risk, not specific to any country, but just overall of, you know, now you look at potentially opening up stores and stuff. Am I right? That that's the way you look at it is it's even more prime for opportunity now than ever. And once you start opening up stores there, you could just see a complete green shoot of adoptions or any additional commentary on your view on India as now we've navigated COVID and supply chain and so many challenges over the past two years. Thank you, gentlemen.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': \"Yeah, Jim, we actually did fairly well through COVID in India, and I'm even more bullish now on the other side of it, or hopefully on the other side of it. And that's the reason why we're investing there with bringing retail there and bringing the online store there and putting a significant amount of energy there. I'm very bullish on India.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk06', 'text': \"Thank you. And then as my quick follow-up, you'd mentioned that services, not necessarily specific to India, but services overall were better than expected. And of course, supply chain was more challenged than expected. So what was the bridge factor of services being better than expected on the upside? Was it like advertising or apps or paid monthly subscriptions or what were kind of the things that really surprised you to the upside on services? Thank you.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk05', 'text': \"It was primarily, Jim, it's Luca. It's primarily this level of engagement that we saw, which then it reflects into the As you said, the paid subscriptions, we saw very good results in our cloud services business, in payment services. Music was very strong. So we had a number of categories that set new records, all-time records, and they did a bit better than we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. And so Tim mentioned it. during, I think, his prepared remarks that when you look at it in constant currency, we grew services double digits, and that was on top of a 24% increase a year ago. So it's very sustained growth that we're seeing.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk06', 'text': 'Thank you so much, and congratulations to you and all your teams.'}, {'speaker': 'spk07', 'text': 'Thanks, Jim. Can we have the next question, please?'}, {'speaker': 'spk12', 'text': 'Our next question will come from Chris Sankar of Cowan & Company.'}, {'speaker': 'spk09', 'text': 'Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them, too. First one, Tim or Luca, you mentioned how the macro did soften and had an impact. And as consumers tighten their belts, when you look across your hardware products and service businesses, where have you seen the biggest impact and where have you seen the least impact from the softening macro? And then I had a quick follow-up.'}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': 'We think there were some impact across the products and in services. Probably the ones that we saw the most impact on were Mac and wearables. You can see that in those numbers. And probably the least would have been iPhone.'}, {'speaker': 'spk09', 'text': 'Got it. Got it. Very helpful, Tim. And then just a quick follow-up on the MAC. You know, the PC industry is expecting decline in PC shipments this year also. How to think about the MAC relative to kind of like where the PC industry as a whole is expecting the shipments to end up? Is there any color you can give on that? Thank you very much.'}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': \"The industry is very challenged, as you say. The industry is contracting. I think from us, though, and I don't know how this year will play out, so I don't want to predict the year, but over the long run, we have a market that is a reasonable-sized market, a big market, and we have low share. And we have a competitive advantage with Apple Silicon. And so strategically, I think we're well positioned in the market, albeit I think it will be a little rough in the short term.\"}, {'speaker': 'spk09', 'text': 'Thanks a lot, Tim.'}, {'speaker': 'spk01', 'text': 'Yeah.'}, {'speaker': 'spk07', 'text': \"Thanks, Krish.
