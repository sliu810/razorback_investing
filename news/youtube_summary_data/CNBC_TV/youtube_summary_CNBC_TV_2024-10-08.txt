<div><strong>Title:</strong> GM investor day: Here's what to listen for<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> another day.  i will stop right there but  always appreciate it.  thank you.  >>> speaking of china, live in  tennessee ahead of gm investor  day where china will be a key  focus.  >> it will be a focus because  china, which was once they  strengthen private driver for  general motors, has become a  drag and a question of what  happens in the future.  especially after losing 10 hunt  -- $210 million in china.  three topics will get a lot of  attention.  out is general motors plan to  cut the losses and adjust its  footprint in china?  a restructuring.  ev growth, we were at the  battery plant in springhill as  well as the gm spring hill plant but they are doing flexible  manufacturing between ice  models and ev models.  we have peak profitability for  general motors?  there are more than a few out  there who say yeah.  i don't think it gets better  than this even the headwinds  heading into 2025.  when you look at shares of  general motors, they remain  bullish about the prospects  when it comes to ev's.  specifically the fact they grew  them by 60% in the third  quarter relative to last year  and there up sequentially.  they continue to pickup market  share in the ev business in the  u.s. and they say they are  scratching the service,  especially like the equinox  which is a lower-priced mode<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Don't see the point in chasing the market when valuations are 'quite full', says Barclays' Krishna<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> spirit that's the worst since  2008.  that was a big seller.  the s&p is coming up closing  lows in the bull market  approaching its second  birthday.   where do we go from here?  head of u.s. strategy has a  target of 5600.  good to see you.  you haven't been moved to  increase your target like some  others?  >> no.  >> why not?  >> let's see what happens.  if you see what's happening,  numbers have been cut sharply  going end.  what is anchoring the market is  big tech even though they are  running themselves.  then seasonality.  october is the weakest month.  you don't want to get ahead of  that.  that said, we are optimistic.  i think we have -- of 6100.  we have a downside.  we think of site is relatively  more likely than downside.  i don't see a point in -- the  market and valuations are quite  full across the board.  >> within a percent of all-time  highs in the major indices.  the only make seven our all- time highs is meta.  you don't think the market has  broadened out?  >> the market in some ways has  broadened.  instead of only 25% company  eating the s&p and now it's 40%  which  is decent.  the broadening in earnings is  taking place but incremental.  the reality of the anchor for  the markets remains big tech  which is a conglomeration of  six stocks.  that earnings growth despite  moderating is going to be more  than four times of the s&p.   that is where we shake out.  >> i won't ask whether 50 was a  mistake but what you expect 50  again?  >> no.  we do not expect 50.  i won't say if it's right or  wrong because you can do monday  morning quarterbacking.  clearly they were focused on  the labor market and wanted to  be preemptive and they have  wiggle room.  inflation is coming down so  they have flexibility.  that said, we don't think it's  likely they go ahead with 50  more.  it will be 25.  >> bond yields a headwind if we  stay higher for longer?  >> we have done work on that.  bond yield become a headwind  what's a comes closer to the 5%  level.  you could have a situation  where there is a positive  correlation between equities  and rates because look at  what's happening growth rate  now.  the economy is strong and  inflation is decent.  the job market is strong and  wages are going up.  things are okay.  the near term expect, because  move too fast too soon.  >> is not everywhere.  it has been confusing to talk  about the economic signals.  a lot of the data points are  coming in good.  manufacturing around the globe  was pretty weak.  we have not seen expansion  there in several months.  we will have more and pepsi  later but not painting a strong  picture of the u.s. consumer  for the global consumer.  especially at the low income  level.  it's sort of confusing.  >> it's a mixed bag.  you are right about  manufacturing.  the u.s. -- only a third  manufacturing.  services site is pretty strong.  they are extremely robust.  if you look at employee, the  same story.  weak on manufacturing a strong  on services.  it's a mixed bag.  those companies which have more  of a brand, able to hang in  there.  a majority of them are  struggling.  we created a basket of stocks  which we f<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Gaming sector is seeing record growth<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> the gambling industry in the united states has reached a period of transformation this week the tropicana is coming down out with the olds making way for the new sports has exploded in the world of gambling and commercial casinos are on fire with me now the ceo of the american gaming association bill miller to what do you attribute the continued growth in gambling well i think it's really been an exciting time if you think about co's not that long ago and there were so many people who said look the gameing industry is going to have this sugar high period and then it's going to dissipate and what we've seen though is 41 months in a row of continued growth and that is really something to celebrate secondly what the industry recognized was we have an opportunity to reset and that reset was demographically everybody had always said well you know the thing about the casino industry is it's a blue hair business and the older you get the the the more likely we're going to get casino pat what we've seen in the last few years is the demo for our industry has skewed down from 50 to 42 and the reason is because we were able in the early days postco to introduce an entirely new segment of the population a whole new demographic millennials gen zers to our industry the gaming floor and all of the other elements of the industry in order to create a new customer base these are also young people who are growing up on online gambling or gaming that then when they reach an age where it's legal or where where it's legal that it's not much of a leap to figure out how to play games that they know and love online for money yeah but but for this industry to keep growing do you have to have more states embracing eye gaming and expanding opportunities in sports betting um look i think the sports betting has shown to be an incredible success right we've literally gone from one state in america where you could legally bet on sports to 39 in the district of columbia all in six years and so that legalization created another whole cohor of customers that understand the gaming industry many of which understand the gaming industry through their phone because that's how they interact with in all consumer facets and so the gambling industry whether it's the casinos sports betting or eye gaming these are all elements that i think that you know our customers want us to interact with them in a way that they want to interact and so that's our job because of the explosion in the digital business it has also brought with it an unprecedented level of scrutiny about where there might be societal harm whether there's underage game gambling whether uh integrity in sports can be guaranteed now you have lawmakers coming forward and introducing legislation that they think will help protect consumers that also creates a headwind doesn't it for the industry how do you deal with that well that's a lot to impact so i'll start with the congressional threat you know if you will look i i think that there are always people who want to see the industry in the manner in which they view it right and so like 435 members of the house 100 members of congress right now the industry has never been seen more favorably by the general public as a mainstream entertainment outet and so are we going to go back to a a place of prohibition which some in congress want i don't think so the american public doesn't think so and the congress doesn't think so and so look well-intentioned fine but our industry has been built on responsibility and sustainability based around creating the right kind of relationships with our customers and so i feel really good about where we are as an industry and i look at that from the perspective of who care who really cares i mean in terms of policy makers a couple policy makers have said we need to re this in this is out of control when we say we needed to create more advertising in order to move people from the illegal market into the legal marketplace advertising helped us do that it helped us break down some of the illegal market and we're happy about that but we've also seen in the last two years via neelen that advertising spend for sports betting specifically which is what gains all of the attention has been down both years when you think about what's to come do you anticipate needing more fight on enforcement warding off the unregulated offshore casinos or sweep stakes which operators are really avidly defending their right to operate sweep stak style gaming um very challenging questions the one is pretty easy you know offshore online websites that prey upon customers in america they should be outlawed because they are against the law and our members and our companies go through a pretty rigorous regulatory scrutiny in order to get license and then be able to operate and so the offshore guys really that needs to be a priority for law enforcement now the sweep stakes is a little bit different because these are individuals who and this is an industry that is constantly reinventing itself and that these individuals that have created these businesses are operating under in their opinion a regulatory frame that works and some jurisdictions have accepted that we think that at the end of the day if you're going going to operate a real money sports betting business or a real money ey gaming business it has to be underneath the gambling umbrella in terms of regulation and so you know we're all working our way through this you know at the a we have tried to do everything that we can to make sure that regulators understand they are the ultimate arbiters of what regulatory frame these people operate under one more the court has now just cded again with cy when it comes to predictions markets and the election we have a big election coming up there are those who argue and and the commodities commission is one of them that it interferes with the integrity of elections and the same way people might argue about the integrity of sports where do you come down on the predictions markets and whether that's gambling and should be regulated like gambling well i think first of all gambling should be regulated at the state level i think that that has been the way in which this industry was created and that's the way it should stay the federal government has a role fon money laundering irs and treasury those are all really important uh people that we we pay very close attention to but as it relates to should there be gambling options in and around uh politics uh my view is that it's not the federal government's role to empower this and i although i don't necessarily believe the argument that people make that you know if you would bet on the futures of politics that then you can control the outcome i think that that's kind of a reach but you know i'm an old political guy and i don't think that it's very easy to actually control outcomes of elections and then by extension create integrity issues around the election now i will go back to the the integrity of sports because that is one of those things that we've ted talked about in the past and is always core that our our industry we work with our partners at the in all of the leagues with teams arenas broadcasters in order to make sure that the most important thing if we're going to create a legal robust sports betting market is that the integrity of the game is san recet the interesting thing when you think about this is when you bet on football if you have the overwhelming number of bets coming in on the patriots it doesn't necessarily mean that the patriots are more likely to win but a lot of times in the predictions market if you have an overwhelming number of markets coming in for a particular candidate the interpretation is that candidate is more likely to win yeah maybe i mean it's like polling though you know you think about polling and you kind of say well are is is polling accurate and now people are voting in the predictions market with their money rather than maybe misleading a pollster but there's still this this is a very inexact science and again better left of the states than the federal government and again this is bill miller personal view i don't think that america we should be in the in the political betting business phil on that note thank you thank you<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Cramer’s Stop Trading: Affirm Holdings<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> >>> time for jim to stop  treating.  >> top 10 the comes out for  anyone who wants to sign up.  i had one part which is bgi g  down.  then they came on and gave a  presentation about the last  quarter that said buy now, pay  later is incredible.  he's gotten incredibly low,  falls.  i think he is the real deal and  i think the firm can go higher.  i like the upgrade.  by the way, paypal is doing  incredibly well.  the bottom by our partner when  he had -- fantastic.  >> these are both buy now, pay  later.  it's the way a lot of people,  think it's a cultural thing.  because, we had credit cards  and people to buy now, pay  later and if you do it with  max, his artificial  intelligence that tells who  will pay back.  spirit target, 68.  >> i think it's a really good  stock.  i missed it.  i think there is more.  >> i don't know if you saw the  journal piece about legacy  credit card keeping the rates  high to make up for the caps on  late fees.  even as rates decline.  >> capital one does work.  he has done an incredible job.  a look at american's downgraded  and i've got to tell you, it  will be like pepsico.  watch what pepsico did.  that's the analog of what  happens when you have a stock  that goes down every day and  every quarter.  >> and shares her up.  >> everyone is freaking out  this morning.  you know?  the stock is been down from 183. it has a 3 1/4% yield.  that could be the theme.  >> how about tonight?  >> i have jenna rack.  just because i can afford to  keep throwing that away.  >> when the power goes out.  >> this man, what he has been  telling, and you have to  understand, it<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> What to expect from the market<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> already. >> but him selling the shares  itself will put pressure on it. >> time will tell. some interesting things. let's talk about it, in fact. there are some, i don't know --  i've been troubled for a while,  but we know that. both the dow and s&p 500 seeing  their worst day yesterday since  september 6th, as oil prices and treasuries rose. joining us now at the technicals levels he's watching, jason  hunter, head of technical  strategy at jpmorgan. 22 and change on the vix. there were some weird re-post  stuff going on, the ten-year has been headed higher. are there concerning  underpinnings or is it all  systems go? >> i think it's a little  confusing, given the leadership  changes we've seen since  mid-summer in the equity space,  where you've had defensives and  cyclicals rally at the same time and kind of take the baton from  tech, which doesn't entirely  make sense. it looks like the market is  trying to make both tail risk  bets at the same time going into the september fmoc. but regardless, that's got the  smp, having broken out after the fmoc, after an all-time high,  from a pure chart-based  perspective is a positive, it's  maintained that breakout, hasn't been able to build on it, but a  breakout's a breakout. >> that's the question, i guess. is it going to break out or is  it going to go down? and do you see any signs that we could be topping out? >> you know, so i would say,  when you take the big step back, and some of the commentary we've had over the last months, when  you look at how long the curve's been inverted and now you're  starting to get a bullish  steepening impulse, generally,  that tends to coincide more with bearish equity performance, at  least over a short-term. you know, as the fed's initially starting to ease. but we haven't had the data to  really suggest that, oh,  recession's -- the sum of the  labor data softened, but the  unemployment rates ticked back  down. the demand data has picked back  up. and you can see the equity  market is quite confused by  that. again, with the leadership shift that we've seen. you know, so, at the end of the  day, it's a lot of mixed  signals. the individual charts across  different asset classes, you get a lot of things that don't  necessarily fit together. so what i've done in the recent  months is i'll take each chart  at face value and leave the kind of the macro overlay aside. the pieces aren't necessarily  fitting together right now. and like i said, if we get a  breakout in the s&p, a breakout  in the russell 2000 like we had  after fmoc, that's a bullish  bias. i'll put my stock just  underneath the breakout levels  and act more like a trend  follower, than trying to get  ahead of the things. because that quite frankly has  not worked. >> do you try to handicap  geopolitical events? or you don't even try? >> no, so i think you recognize  what those risks are, and i  think it's more about risk  management around the views and  trades, where -- set a tighter  stop. or some of the things that tend  to go non-linear, if you think  about brenttraded back up into  the summer range, and you  realize, that may not just be a  move into the upper end of the  range, that could be a blowoff. and you realize the risks around the views and set your stops  accordingly. >> okay. so what about the breadth of the advance right now? finally, something that turned  into a positive or still  something that makes you  skeptical? >> yeah, so i think that's where you see the russell breaking  out, small cap having led large  cap through the latter part of  the summer. you're getting a broader breadth of things that's participating  in the s&p rally. that's generally a positive. that's an early cycle-type  story. let's call that a bet that the  manufacturing cycle globally is  going to start to repair itself. and you can see with dm central  banks easing, some policy news  out of china, that all makes  sense right now. but again, you also had  defensive leadership at the same time. so those two pieces don't  exactly square well together. >> people are just covering  their bases? >> i think that's right. and you treat, in that world,  you just treat each chart  separately and i'll put my  charts in stop after a breakout, i'll chase that, and act a bit  more reactive than trying to  predict where the next pivot's  going to be, and hopefully  things will start to clear up a  bit more and we'll get some  foresight. but right now, being reactive  and keeping tight risk  tolerances the right way --  >> what other markets around the world are important to us right  now? >> i think the rates market is a big one. in fact, when the two-year note  got to 350 recently, going into  and after the fmoc, both the  technicals, you know, just  looking at the chart pattern,  suggests the rally looked  exhausted. but when you look at how the  forward curve was priced, how  many easings they had priced  into the forwards, we actually  went short two-year note. that has backed up with the help of this friday's payroll report, to a level where i don't think  it goes much higher from here. we think 412 is a limit for 2s,  so whatever concerning, let's  say, input that would have into  equities, that, oh, the fed's  not goin<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt on the relationship between sports and gaming<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> it's been an incredible year for sports betting and ey gaming so far this year the through the first seven months sports betting has grown 30% in terms of gross gaming revenue i gaming up about 27% with me now is the ceo of v mgm adam greenblat adam it's great to see you it's great to see you contesta the incredible growth that we're seeing in online play is it mostly coming from states that are ramping up that they're newly legalized or are you seeing incredible growth even in more mature states so it's actually both the the great news for both the uh the more mature states and the new states because it gives you a picture of what's ahead is um appetite and depth is is tremendous and more so than we anticipated at the outset of this of this journey we talked to you at super bowl and you were telling me about your high hopes for new technology at b mgm for regaining some market share that you've lost to competitors the tech is called angstrom how's it working out so we've been delighted with the performance of an you might remember that the first product that we brought to market was focused on mlb and uh what we we became bmgm became the home of the home run uh during the season and the number angstrom powered um uh home run bet increased your reno by 245 and this is all enabled by having different types of markets having more availability having better pricing and that's all powered by angstroms unique approach to pricing when i went to investor day for fanduel a couple weeks ago the company was very clearly happy having taken the number one ey gaming slot happy to have increased their moat around the number one position in sports betting can you catch up well i think in i gaming our strength is is demonstrable we've just won another reward for the third year in a row the i gaming operator of the year and um i think you'll see from some of the early trends that the work that we're doing in in uh product in jackpots in unique and special content only available at at bmgm is bearing fruit um bmgm gave away the largest jackpot ever uh in the history of i gaming uh in new jersey in august $65 million to one lucky player somebody who is playing online somebody who's playing online walked away $6.2 million richer on the day which is wonderful which is exciting but we've also been a pioneer in in our relationship between sports and gaming uh we have got um nba blitz uh we've got nhl gold blitz um these are sport properties and partnerships that that we've built games against and so this bridges our activity in sports with our activity in in i gaming and our sports players love it cross sell year on year is now increasing dramatically we're north of 50% cross sell on a week uh on a weekly basis so really pleased about the potential for both parts of the business i've heard a lot of chatter here at the global gaming expo about the competitive threat of unlicensed gaming whether it's sk bbased games or online sweep stakes models which the operators will say it's perfectly legal to offer these sweep stakes style games is that an existential threat to licensed eye gaming in the united states i don't think so look we as a as a legal operator will always operate within the bounds of of the rules and the law and so i think there there needs to be a a a process of definition scope definition i think um the opportunity for the sweeps uh operators i think the legality of of or the boundaries of of what they're uh uh engaged in still needs to be tested but we'll defend our turf naturally um but we don't we don't see it as existential in any manner at all uh i feel like i ask you this every time we sit together but usually there's a reason for me to ask it that mgm has just um partnered with groupo globo in brazil to launch bet mgm in brazil it will be a direct competitor to main and it doesn't have anything to do with the bet mgm that you're running here in the united states they've launched bet mgm on leo vegas in the uk again a direct competitor to one of your co-owners and tain is this sustainable is it putting you in a difficult position to dance between these two companies yes well just for clarity the uh the the joint venture of which i'm chief executive uh has exclusive rights to operate in the us so there's no there's no debate about who's doing what in in the united states and frankly we're operating harmoniously in north of the border in canada where both leo vegas and tin and the joint venture my b mgm are are all active in the market and you know it's it's not without a degree of of uh uh pleasure that we've come from nothing bm jim my joint venture has come from nothing to be the largest uh operator by market share um in in uh ontario so can we coexist yes are we coexisting yes relationship in the and uh board dynamic and conversation has never been better so i don't it doesn't put me in a difficult position at all what can you learn from ontario for the the rest of the united states south of the canadian border well what we see is uh a market where direct promotional activity is not allowed and that not withstanding a a business can flourish we're demonstrating that what i'm also excited about is the strength of the mgm brand north of the border and that's particularly relevant given that we have alberta coming which is going to be both a sports and i gaming state so it's the first i gaming state we've had in a couple of years and this is obviously b mgm's uh heartland it strength it's uh mgm resorts as a as a brand resonates particularly well uh with uh with gamers and so we're looking forward to capitalizing that uh on that when when alberta regulates how's football oh my goodness so the genesis to what to my excitement is the progress we've made in product and you you you did check angstrom but the whole product experience the bed mgm sports product experience is by some margin better than it's ever been our same game parlay experience our parlay experience our pre-build parlays our linear bet slip which allows us which allows players to see all their bet in a single pain uh a quick bet experience this is one titbit building a quick bet a little uh bar at the bottom of of the screen we've increased by the work we've done we've increased the number of legs on our quick bet by more than 100% and as we know more legs equals more margin and this is weeks in so really excited about the progress we're making our players are enjoying it our players are coming back from week to week in a way uh in a more engaged way than in prior periods and we've been helped by margin the first few weeks of the the season were really favorable to to to the industry and so september closed out what would be a record quarter for bam jy so really excited about that adam thank you for spending some time with me course thank you for having me<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> teased and the release of robo  taxis. but our knicks guest says a lot  of questions remain, including  regulatory issues around  self-driving cars, how tesla  will scale the service, and  ultimately, how much more  competition will be in the  space. joining us right now is  bernstein senior research  analyst, toni sacconaghi. good morning to you. what do you expect we're going  to hear? we've been waiting for this news for a long time. i think it's exciting to me, but also for many, there's some  skepticism about when it will  actually arrive. >> good morning, andrew. yes, i think the consensus is  that tesla will announce a  dedicated robo taxi model,  likely to be available at some  point in the future. let's say '27 or '28, that tesla will demonstrate a application,  whereby a ride-hailing app, that it will provide some sort of  update on where they are on full self-driving, and maybe also  potentially announce that it's  doing some robo taxi trials. i expect if they did that, those would have to be with an  accompanying driver. but nevertheless, starting  trials in one or my cities in  the u.s. i think that's generally what's  expected amongst investors. there are big questions about  whether tesla will provide  updates on optimus robot or  whether it will provide an  update on new models,  particularly the revamped models expected next year, or a  lower-cost model expected in  '27. but i think the focus will  ultimately be on a robo taxi,  you know, unveiling itself and  an accompanying ride-hailing  app. >> so, toni, we're looking at  the stock at $242.92. if, in fact, they make this  announcement, how does this  change the game? how does it change how you would value this company? >> you know, i think investors  are applying different  probabilities and discount rates to a robo taxi service going  forward. so i think it's widely  anticipated, but as you noted at the outset, there are lots of  questions. there are technical questions  about whether tesla can get to  the reliability level with a  more limited censor sweep. they only have cameras. other competing autonomous  vehicles have lidar and radar,  so there's technical question. i think there's a regulatory  question. there's a timing question. and you know, how competitive is this space going to be? are prices going to be driven  down and how much value will  there be to be captured? so investors are ascribing  differently possibilities and -- >> what possibilities are you  ascribing and how are you doing  the valuation then? >> this is what i think about  it, andrew. i think it will be difficult for tesla to leapfrog other players. uber and waymo are doing testing in other cities. even if tesla is able to  leapfrog, it i think it will be  a limited -- you know, limited  to a year advantage. let's say in a year, tesla has  level five robo taxis that can  go anywhere, they have a  ride-hailing service. my guess is, competitors will  catch up reasonably quickly. so this notion of having  sustained outside profits, even  if tesla were to leapfrog given  the technical hurdles and the  regulatory hurdles, i think are  difficult. and the valuation of uber is  $150 billion. the valuation of uber, you know, probably in the u.s. is half of  that, $75 billion. tesla's stock today embeds, we  think, $600 billion beyond the  core auto business. much of that ascribed to robo  taxis. we struggle with that  differential, given the  probabilities that i --  >> let me ask you this in terms  of the competition piece of it. which is to say, you made the  argument that you think that an  uber and a waymo will have an  advantage, maybe given lidar and other things over tesla. there's an argument to be made,  and maybe you'll disagree with  it, which is that they have a  number of the -- a number? thousands, tens of thousands of  these cars on the street today  that have cameras on them,  they're taking in data that  can't really be matched. if you look at some of their  self-driving features right now, they clearly seem to be the  leader or the most advanced in  terms of where that would be, if you were to sort of set aside  what waymo is doing. is there an argument to be made  that they will leapfrog  everybody? and that they in some ways  already have? >> well, i think the bulk case  is that they will leapfrog. i think it's very difficult to  say that they already have. because, you kno<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Aristocrat Gaming CEO: Competition is good for the industry<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> it's been an incredible year for casino game makers and designers and the stocks are on fire aristocrat gaming ceo hector fernandez joins me now it's good to see you it's great to see you to what do you attribute so much remarkable growth look i think we've really honed down and invested on the things that really mattered the number one thing that matters is all around dnd or r&d and creating game content that the players want to play and more importantly creating strong partnerships with our customers to ensure that anytime they put our games on the floor they know they're going to work i went to uh flutters investor day a couple weeks ago and fanduel ceo amy how was talking about their success with i gaming and she said what they found is that they have more success with games online if they are brands that gamblers know and love from casino floors so how much of your design comes from what works on the floor and how much of it comes from testing out the designs in the digital space and then bringing that to the casino floor sure we do a little bit of both but really when you think about the strength of aristocrat it's really around its legacy brands and the content we've created and if you think about the north american consumer particularly you're seeing that the north americ consumer has a strong affinity for the brands that they've played on the floor than we've brought to real life on a digital setting but another really important thing about that is one of the things that we focused and you and i have talked about this is how do we do it in a responsible way so we've invested very heavily also around a responsible gaming uh strategy and pillars uh we you mentioned the r&d i know a lot goes into it there was a lot of headlines over a lawsuit by aristocrat against competitor light and wonder over their game dragon train can you talk a little bit about creating uh a moat around the games that you're designing well you know we don't comment on ongoing litigation one of the things is pivotal for us is to aggressively defend our ip that we create okay and and you've talked to me in the past about the competitive disadvantage of non-licensed games so skills-based games if uh if you see those sort of slot machines pl proliferate proliferate easy for me to say if you see them proliferate how difficult is it for you to keep growing your business well how much of a competitive disadvantage is that we keep a very strong lens on what's happening around competitively and we actually really like competition competition is actually really good for the industry and one of the things that we do is look at industry trends and making sure that we stay ahead of those industry trends but we want it to be in a regulated environment it is really important when you look at the world out there that everything from a landbased uh st standpoint is a is in a regulated setting where does the growth come from does it come from more states legalizing online gambling does it come from more growth in bricks and mortar casinos it comes from both and that's the beauty of the aristocrat business is when you look at how successful we've been over the last 5 six years we've grown in north america we've grown in asia we've grown in europe and latin america and now with the acquisition of neo games we have the opportunity to grow online as states regulate eye gaming hector thank you for being with us<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Caesars CEO Tom Reeg on capturing market share in the digital business<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> getting back a little bit of  what they gave back yesterday,  35 points now on the dow. nasdaq a little bit stronger, up 82. s&p up 52. >> going to get over to contessa brewer, because she's got a  story on this. gambling's biggest luminaries  coming together this week in las vegas. contessa brewer is live at the  center of it all and she joins  us now with a special guest. good morning, contessa! >> good morning, andrew! and welcome to las vegas! look, caesars has a lot of news. they just announced new  buybacks, a new $1 billion in  debt offering, and tom reeg  joins me bright and early here  in las vegas. it's nice to see you. i'm just curious how much your  share price had to do with the  stock buyback and why does it  take that kind of news to juice  the stock of a company that has  been performing on all  cylinders. >> yeah, contessa, to go back,  we closed the merger with  caesars in july of 2020. we all remember, it was a  different world then. we had a significant capital  spending program that we stepped into when we bought caesars. we had $400 million we needed to spend in new jersey. we were building an expansion in new orleans that opens two weeks from now that was $435  million --  >> in time for super bowl next  year. >> that's right. >> and a new property in  virginia that's over $800  million that will open before  the end of the year. as we were reaching the end of  that cycle and looking at what  was happening with free cash  flow and where our stock was, it was an easy decision to start to buy some stock. in terms of where the share  price was, we were on the wrong  side of the macro trade while  the fed was raising rates. we were a levered company coming out of a merger. and now that the fed has moved  into a cutting cycle, we've seen a turn in our stock. >> you also just made a deal  with the union late last year  that gives the biggest pay hike  that your employees have ever  seen. you've got casinos all over the  country, the biggest operator in terms of number of properties in the united states. what are you seeing about the  american economy and where  customers are, that  discretionary income might be a  concern. >> yeah, i would say we're about the purest measure of consumer  discretiona ary given the busins that we're in. and it's been remarkably  resilient. we had the kind of a bubble when stimulus checks went out, and  that faded a little bit as that  money was spent, but the  consumer remains quite strong. you see here in vegas, i'm sure  this week, the market is packed. we're running at 99% occupancy  year round. the regional business is holding in well, and the digital  business is growing incredibly  strongly, so we've got a  business that did $2.9 billion  of ebitda combined coming out of the merger that's doing about $4 billion now. >> okay. first on las vegas, wells fargo  said its las vegas f1 room rate  tracker took a turn to the  downside with average daily  rates down 40% year over year. is that an indication that  there's not enthusiasm over f1? is that what you're seeing? >> i -- i would look at it more  as an indication of garbage  numbers. they're measuring really what's  8% of our room base in terms of  where rates were last year. it was well known that we held  rates very high coming into the  race and they dropped, as it  came. what we learned last year was  that we needed to fill sooner. so we're not holding rates as  high. if i look at, you know, f1 for  us, you know, it was a lift last year of almost $20 million --  >> wow. >> -- versus the weekend the  prior year. this year i would say, you know, flat to up or down a few million bucks versus last year, but up  the 20 versus two years ago. >> you mentioned the digital  business. you know, the powerhouse in this space is fanduel and draftkings  coming in a strong number two. and then there's this fight over the third and fourth positions. how important is it to you --  you just launched a new online  casino app, horseshoe,  yesterday. how much is this important to  the growth of caesars' business? and can you make an impact? can you grab market share away  from the two big players? >> yeah, contessa, i'm  old-fashioned, i like to make  money. i measure it based on how much  money we're making, not how much market share we have. so our promo spend is a third to a half of what draftkings and  fanduel have. so those subsidies don't run  through our ggr market share  numbers. but we've got a business that's  approaching, soon will exceed  20% ebitda margins, in a  business where most are still  losing money. >> before i let you go, you  know, we're keeping an eye on  florida and hurricane milton. i know you have -- your home is  in florida. i'm just -- how are things  looking for you? how is the situation for you,  being here and watching that  storm approaching? >> it's deja vu from two years  ago. i was in vegas watching ian hit  our home two years ago. this storm seems to be tracking  north of us. but we'll still have to deal  with surge and you should pray  for anybody that's in the middle of this. it's -- it's awful to go through these. and after the news cameras  leave, you know, a week or two  from now and go to where the  next storm is going to land, the people where it hits will have  to deal with this for the next  five or ten years. >> it is a monst<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Hurricane Helene's devastating impact on North Carolina: What you need to know<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> they're also scrambling to clear remaining debris leftover from  helene just two weeks ago, which could turn into projectiles with high winds and that makes all of this that much more dangerous  and complicated. >> meantime, recovery efforts  from hurricane helene, which has now claimed at least 230 lives,  continue across the southeastern united states. officials are tackling storm  damage and misinformation  related to the storm. let's bring in julia coin. she's a reporter with the  charlotte observer. she's been out in the field  covering the storm's devastate  impact on north carolina. her newspaper, in fact, has a  reality check page to fact check misinformation related to the  hurricane and the recovery  efforts. and julia, we want to thank you  for being with us. i know you've been out on the  ground there. tell us, first of all, what  you've seen in terms of the  devastation. and by the way, you're someone  who comes from sanibel island in florida. you have seen hurricanes before, but what did you think of what  you saw this time? >> yeah, so i've been on the  ground and also up in the air  and embedding with pilots who  are using helicopters to air  drop supplies and also pilots  who are in small bush planes  surveying the damage, trying to  see if roads are accessible, if  anyone's sending smoke signals,  that sort of thing. i've been both on the ground and in the air, seeing the damage  and it's just -- it's extensive. it's eerie how common the sights become, both when you're walking around and flying above, just  seeing all of the devastation in the area. >> i mean, i've been reading  about how they're still trying  to recover bodies at this point, going out with cadaver dogs,  taking them on the rivers,  trying to sort through the  debris that's piled up all over  the place. this is a horrible situation. there have been lots of concerns about the abilities of the  rescue efforts. what would you say with what  you've seen? >> yeah, so i have been mostly  involved with volunteers on the  ground. i've met a few organizations  leading relief efforts and  rescue efforts that have brought those dogs out. i haven't heard numbers above  one or two bodies recovered per  town, but of course those  numbers continue to develop  every day. >> what do you think about  fema's response to this? there have been a lot of  accusations that have been made  that fema is not doing enough,  that they weren't prepared for  this, that they are turning away some of the local volunteers who have been right to bring things  in. is that the case? >> i have not seen that. again, i have been involved with those volunteers and talking to  people on the ground. so i can only speak to what i've run into, in those situations  and i can say that a lot of  people who are in these very  isolated communities haven't  seen government efforts, but  that's just what they're seeing  in these very small towns that  only locals really know how to  navigate. >> right. how -- what is most needed at  this point? what do people there say that  they would need from the  outside, whether that be  volunteers or the government? >> these people are  self-described stubborn people,  so when we show up with  supplies, at this point, most of them are pretty set. they are still asking for  diapers above the size of 5 and  efforts are now shifting to keep people warm, as cold weather  rolls in. that could mean blankets, socks, coats, that sort of thing. >> i know one of the places that you went was to rescue a  70-year-old woman and her dog. they were running short on  medical supplies, that's really  another layer of things that  they haven't talked about. even if you were there and were  supplied for things, you may not have anticipated you would need  two, three, four weeks of  medication or other items. how big is the need for that? >> right. so that area, specifically, they received a few days of rain  before the storm came. so this woman's doctor's  appointment was canceled. and she did not have her heart  medicine, even before helene  came. so i was with the helicopter who was able to lift her out, but  that's just one story of many. that's why access to roads and  areas to land have becom<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> GM investor day: Key insights to expect from the automaker<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> box." gm ceo mary barr expected to  tell the automakers how to talk  about to investors. >> pop quiz time. do you know what this is? take a guess. this is one battery cell. one battery cell. i want to give you some  perspective on the ramp-up in  production of battery cells here at the ultium cells production  plant. ultium else out of south korea. there are 36 of these cells in  each of these carriers as they  go through final production  here. some perspective on how many  they're manufacturing here. look over here. it's a little hard to see, but  all the way down there, you see  those blue krcrates, there's abt 2 million cells that have gone  through production down there,  and as we come over here, i'll  show you how big this facility  is. by the way, they're only at 40%  capacity. they're just scratching the  surface in terms of what they  plan to do in manufacturing  here. another 3 to 4 million cells in  these crates over here. all of these cells, by the way,  will be manufactured and out the door in 15 to 20 days. and again, they're at 40%  capacity. why are we in here? by the way, the first cameras  that have ever been here for a  live report in the battery  production area. the reason we're here is because this is critical to what mary  barra will be talking about  today at the gm investor day. ev variable profitability. that is the target that they  have set all year, to get there  by the end of this year. where are they on that path? do they still believe they can  get to variable profitability. they are clearly ramping up ev  production. we saw it yesterday. you clearly see it here in this  battery cell production  facility. also, peak profits. evs are a big part of the future for general motors, but peak  profits right now in terms of  internal combustion engine  vehicles, more than a few people are questioning if they can  continue to be as profitable or  growing profit in that area. and finally, what's happening  with china? is there a restructuring in the  future there. general motors, as you take a  look at shares of gm, they have  lost $210 million in china in  the first half of the years. there was a time, just a few  years ago, where general motors  was making a couple billion  dollars a year in china. but as that market has dlachang  dramatically, general motors is  facing tough questions there. all of those questions will be  front and center when we talk  with mary barra exclusively  later today, ahead of the gm  investor day here in spring  hill, tennessee. we'll discuss not only china, ev production, the ramp-up in evs,  getting to variable  profitability, and where general motors is right now, in terms of its plans for continuing to grow profits. so lots to discuss with mary  barra. and this is a very cool place <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy: Harris is running against someone rather than for something<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> is making the media rounds now,  starting with the week off with  cbs' "60 minutes." the vice president discussing  her plan for the economy, still  fell short of providing answers  on how she's going to pay for  some of the agenda. joining us to talk about this  and much more former house  speaker kevin mccarthy. we are seeing her venture forth  now, after what some would say  was quite a while and i don't  know whether you'd say she was  sort of forced to do it. why do you think it's happening  now? >> well, she's being forced. her whole plan was to stay away  from the media all the time and  it started playing against her. but, okay. she's gone on "60 minutes." but anyone tell me her three  points of what she's going to do if she wins? no. and so, it's not breaking  through. you've got -- if you ask --  >> i can tell you what she said. >> yeah, i can tell you what she said. >> yeah. what are the three things she'll do if she wins.  >> try to deal with housing,  right? >> with $25,000, yeah. >> no, $25,000, going to build  more houses so there's a greater supply. she says she's going to give a  $50,000 credit to small  businesses, right? what else is on your list? >> i'm sorry, you can't run for  president -- you can't say, i'm  going to stop immigration, build a wall, make the economy  stronger. >> the idea that you're eye  sasa  i saying that nobody knows --  >> she's going to raise taxes on corporations. going to raise taxes on  individuals. she's going to do that to  maintain and increase programs  for what she says is the middle  class. she says she's going to support  roe v. wade, those are the  things she's going to do. on the other side --  >> you can't have it clear. running for president every  single time --  >> running for president by not  being donald trump. >> yeah, she's running against  something instead of for  something. so if she was to win, to govern  would be very difficult. and, look, i think everybody is  missing the wrong polls. this is a very close race. there's no undecided voter  anymore. it's whatever candidate is able  to get out the low-propensity  voters. only interesting bowl is gallup. they don't know who you're  voting for, they ask who do you  identify, republican or  democrat. for the very first time,  republicans beat democrats. by three points. you see the disparity between  republican and democrat, usually three or five points, you can  tell who wins the presidency. the second question they asked,  who was best to solve the  problem in the future,  republicans. it's a better climate,  republicans should be performing better. and it all inches down to  pennsylvania. and pennsylvania is tied right  now. if you look back four years ago, biden was winning in  pennsylvania right now by a high number. if you look at wisconsin, biden  was winning wisconsin by six  points but only won it by 20,000 votes. so you can't play into the polls that are in the margin of error. what do they mean? and is trump still getting the  underpoint that he's made  before. >> there's a possibility that  there's a massive undercount  going on we saw it in 2016 and  2020. >> could you even ask for more  fairness -- i'll make one point, the outrage machine for elon  musk for now endorsing trump is  out of control. now, twitter is still a free  exchange of ideas from both  sides. on the other hand, "the new york times" just endorsed kamala  harris. that's the 17th straight  democrat "the new york times"  has endorsed since dwight d.  eisenhower. that was the last time, that was 1956. take your pick of any democrat  you want to go along the way. they've endorsed every single  one. >> mondale over reagan. >> the arbiter of all truth and  all fair, journalistic  integrity, in the world, does  that every year. not a word is spoken about --  >> can i just say something? there's --  >> okay, but what about the 17  times --  >> an editorial page of the  newspaper --  >> okay. >> i understand that. there's a news page. if you want to the conflate  them, you can go ahead and --  >> i am conflating them. >> i understand that. >> i see the choice of -- look,  there's an overriding viewpoint  from the "times" and everywhere, andrew. not just the op-ed page. 17 straight. >> theres what an editorial --  but it was an editorial page. i just don't understand --  >> you don't think the rest of  the paper --  >> no, and i'm not going to  engage in that with you. >> do you ever feel like a  divorced child? >> no, you cannot deny it, i  think the arbiter of "the new  york times" -- your overall  point which you bring into the  news conversation every day --  >> right. >> the overall point that you  bring into the news conversation every day is one of a  conservative republican who is  explicitly supporting this  president. that's a distinction. >> i'm talking about at this  point, elon musk has suddenly  totally left -- keith goldman  said he needs to leave the  country. and x shut down. >> i think the point that joe is making, you get treated  differently if you come out and  endorse trump. people loved elon before. i think overall, as americans,  we've got to get to a point  where we can respect somebody's  differences of opinion, right? you may have a difference of  opinion. i was just texting with somebody today that's mad at me about my  party. right? i still like the individual. i just texted back, you made me  smile. you made me laugh, right? i respect that you have a  difference of opinion, but i  want to have those discussions  and not dislike you over it. elon, we can't bring our  astronauts back from space  unless it was for elon. we just had a hurricane where  these people can't have internet unless it was for elon. if somebody from the left and  cared about the environment, the only person that developed an  electric car that everybody  loved was tesla. because it hinges on the first  amendment -- that's what got  him. >> the deal with elon and trump, his businesses will benefit  instead of --  >> no --  >> -- obviously, the preferred  candidate for elon musk is --  >> elon's preferred candidate is the constitution, more than a  person. overwhelmingly -- look, i've  known elon for more than --  before he was very wealthy. and he's always hinged<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> un unwinding of the yen carry  trade. joining me now is victoria  greene. vicky, great to see you.  >> good morning, frank.  >> vicky, give us your word of  the day. >> it's a tempest. a violent, windy storm that  could disrupt economic data  going forward. finally, we get to earnings on  f  friday. we have to weather the tempest. we are watching yields  carefully. a lot of that move's done. that should hold. the fed is pricing in 22 bps of  cuts in november. another maybe 25 bps in  december. you repriced expectations a bit. man, we had a lot thrown at us  in october. the markets have been resilient  given the data that has come out from macro to geopolitical and  two massive hurricanes in two  weeks. all resilient in the bull  market.  >> vicky, you are mentioning the ten-year yield above 4%. i talked about this on the show  yesterday. people texted me it didn't  matter and others saying it is  meaningful. is the two-year above 4%  meaningful? >> sure. if you hit the 4.5, it becomes  meaningful. i think it is priced in and able to be absorbed. if we seethe change in fed  policy, the trickle down effects are difficult with the equity  with growth stocks and  technology. i'm watching this. it doesn't scare me. 4.5 or moving to 5 is not priced in and that an unpriced move. >> you are bullish on earnings  in q3. 5% for the year for the s&p. energy down 22% year over year. possibly, back to the theme of  tempest, a lot of things  geopolitically and a storm. are we ipricing this in? >> it has been a tough uarter. q3 was ugly for oil prices. a lot will be going forward. what does that look like on the  go forward basis? q3 is priced in. it will be a decline because oil prices fell. i think energy is discounted a  lot. if you look at the buy ratings,  you get the dividends. it is a good total place. you have push-pull politics with china coming online which is  bullish for oil. then you have barrels coming in  from opec which have been  sidelined. you could see those move in the  middle east. >> i want to get to your pick. pepsi. i know it is ahead of earnings. out performing. why are you defensive in the  rate cutting cycle? >> it is a great dividend. they are well known <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Waters: The damage from Hurricane Helene is $11 billion...most from wind.<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> joining me now with the expected economic impact on milton and  the tally of hurricane helene is moody's director of hurricane  models jeff waters. jeff, good to see you.  >> thanks, frank. >> a serious situation here. milton. this is the first time tampa bay area has taken a direct hit in  almost a century since back in  1921. in your mind, what does that  mean about the potential impact  to residents and also property? >> yes, it's very clear here  that the entire coastline of  florida, especially tampa to  fort myers should be on alert  and take the precautions to  evacuate or mitigate their homes as much as they possibly can  against the damaging potential  of wind, but especially storm  surge in this event sglfrmt what i was trying to get to is wore  seeing storms in areas that are  more severe. this is an area that hasn't seen a big storm in almost a century. generally, with construction  built with the idea a hurricane  would come through, whether  residential or commercial or  even government? >> in some cases, yes, in some  cases, you see coastal  properties built at grade. maybe not on stilts or at  elevation. all of these coastal problems,  especially the tampa-st. pete  area. this is will one of the events  that everyone will watch  closely. as you mentioned, tampa bay and  st. petersburg has not seen this in some time. there are a few that are built  at grade and will be subject to  quite storm surge. >> wishing the best to all of  the people there. i want to turn back to hurricane helene. our best estimate from the  damage of hurricane helene is  $11 billion. most of that is from wind and  not water or anything else. with milton, winds increased and a lot of the areas are  recovering from helene, milton  is coming in with strong winds. what are you expecting? how damaging could this be to  property or how life threatening could this be? >> first, the building codes in  the state of florida are the  strong of thein the country. there is a lot of overlap with  milton compared to helene. you will have a lot of damage  that could be exacerbated with  the structures prone to damage a few days back and that could be  tricky in trying to understand  how much worse things get and  trying to figure out which event caused the damage. the building codes are very  strong in florida and especially along coast at areas. we hole fully will see some of  the build back better techniques and codes take action. it will be challenging,  especially with all that debris  that is still on the roads and  in places like tampa that will  make matters a heck of a lot  worse when it comes to seeing  the oncoming impact of milton in a couple days.  >> i've covered a hurricane. i was in new orleans with  hurricane ida. i have seen the damages. when we are talking about  uninsuredd losses, how bad coul  this be? >> it is too reearly to tell. you see the gap with the water  losses with the insured and  water. not as many people have flood  insurance coverage. with helene, and whatever water  impacts are to come, the  economic toll could be bigger  and is a lot impacts. given the coastline from tampa  down to fort myers is in the  cone of uncertainty. that represents the biggest area along <br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> now it's tiffany mcghee's turn. the cio of pivotal advisors. good morning, tiffany. how are you? >> good morning, frank. how are you? >> let's start with your first  pick. lvmh. we heard about the luxury makers under pressure with what's going on in china. what are the opportunities you  see with chinese stimulus? >> so, listen, when we think  about what the aspects of the  chinese stimulus are, there are  three of them, the monetary  stimulus, the mortgage rate cut, and also have new monetary  policy to support the stock  market. we see when that announcement  was made, the areas that kind of reacted positively. we see consumer staples and  financial services and semis  were the main ones. when we think of the chinese  consumer and what benefits  overall, luxury and consumer  st staples. estee lauder is a must have. we put that in the luxury  consumer staple category. china has been such a huge part  of estee lauder growth over, you know, the long term. they really cut estimates in the past a few quarters based on  pressure from the asian travel  are retail. >> tiffany, quickly, while we're talking about chinese stimulus  today, i know you gave us your  picks yesterday. an update. it is disappointing investors  about the stimulus. in your mind, your thesis with  lvmh and estee lauder, does the  stimulus continue or is that  enough to give a big boost in  sales? >> no, listen, i don't think  we're seeing the entire  implications of the stimulus  play out. this will take time. think about in the u.s. when we  got stimulus checks out of the  pandemic. it wasn't just a couple of  months. you know, this is going to take  some time. we like both lvmh and estee  lauder not in the short-term,  but midterm. look at where they're priced  right now at a discount to their prices all year. they've got really, you know, we really see this china stimulus  affecting them positively over  more than just the short-term. >> okay. you mentioned moisturizer is a  must have. there are other things that lvmh sales that is not beauty. they have soft luxury. this your mind, outside of  china, what reaccelerates the  sales there? in europe, i was there earlier  this year. consumers are under a bit of  pressure. >> yeah, listen, you know, lvmh, i call it the stock or the brand that has everything you need to  have a well lux life. to your point, they have so many different areas of luxury. we like that diversified revenue stream. the consumer is cyclical, but we were talking about china  earlier. to put this in perspective, the  chinese consumer is 20% to 2<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Amazon Prime Day is expected to gain more global members, benefiting the company: Evercore's Mahaney<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> kicks off today, hoping to lure  shoppers with exclusive sales  and deals. joining us mark mahaney,  evercorp. a.i. research. it's your favorite stock above  all of them, mark. not necessarily for prime days  but for some other moves that  the economy is making, really,  through like prime tv. >> that's right. it's our number one pick in  large cap and in mega cap. we think we're going to have  ongoing margin expansion both in the retail business and in the  aws business, as per the company as a hole. and free cash flow is continuing to improve. we think we'll see accelerating  growth. and stable growth, double-digit  growth in retail business. you put that all together and  there's a lot of valuation. so, yeah, we like amazon. and prime days just another  feature of it. it's not a needle-mover for the  quarter per se, but it certainly helps and probably will bring in more prime members worldwide  which is always a win for  amazon. >> in terms of operating income, how much does advertising  represent right now? >> oh, that's a good question. they're doing about 50 billion  now, run rate and ad revenue. and they don't disclose what the margins are, gut, geez, it's got to be pretty high, joe. i'm guessing they're doing  almost 50% margins on that if  you look at what google and met  tar doing on that sort of scale, 50 billion in ad revenue, 25 to  25 billion in ad revenue. a substantial profit. the two biggest profit-drivers  here or aws and advertising. by the way, the good thing for  arm zahn and amazon  shareholders, the fastest part  of the business are the highest  margin. it's called the wonderful fix  shift. >> you made a good point. you can only estimate margins  for the advertising side of it. there's a lot more ads now and  there's a lot more content that  sort of -- sounds like nbc, but  there's must-see tv, and number  of options are increasing  especially sports for amazon. >> yeah, joe, strategic pivots  at the company. they've really leaned into being a medial entertainment power is  a strong word. license content, theatrical  content. and over the last few years  we've seen them lean into sports where you get massive audiences. major reach, major frequencies  and you get high cpms. and beginning this year, they  started layering in ads into  amazon prime video. it was one of the biggest  monetized potential ad platforms out there. we think that will help with  profitability. in fact, it's probably the  single biggest driver of ramping margins with profitability. the other one, on the retail  side, they went through a major  capex cycle in 2022 and 2021,  and going into 2022. now they're sort of leveling  that out. and you've got rising  capitalization ute las vegas,  using in centers that they may  have overbuilt. but rising capital utilization,  there's another word for that. it's margin expansion. you get two really nice  tailwinds here. there's headwinds here, they've  got a system called kiper, as  long as they break that out and  give us a sense of what those  costs are and revenue  opportunity, i think the market  will give them a little bit  benefit of the doubt for that. >> do they have any businesses  that would be recession  resistant if the day ever comes  where there's a slowdown? it seems like a lot of these  things will be economically  sensitive? >> no, there's no recession  resistance here, other than, you know, there's a fair amount of  spend which is house hold  essentials. aws, as a business, is kind of  core to most companies. you know, you need to keep the  lights on. you need to keep your data  served up and saved up in the  clouds and the vast -- i don't  know what percentage of amazon's retail business is consumer  discretionary, north of 60%,  maybe 70%. no, if there's a real slowdown,  discretionary spend, given the  size, 10% retail sales, about  the size of walmart, they would  absolutely see an impact to  their growth if there was a  recession. >> okay. we got it there. what's your price target, you  raised it, didn't you? >> yeah, we did. we did. we're up to 250 now, 2026, 30  times three times cash flow gets yo<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Kamala Harris sounds like a 'moderate Republican,' says Pollster Frank Luntz<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> box." the harris-walz campaign onn th  media blitz this week. here is vice president kamala  harris on "60 minutes." >> my plan is saying when you  invest in small businesses, you  invest in the middle class and  strengthen the economy. small businesses are the  backbone of the american  economy. >> pardon me, madame vice  president. my question is how do you pay  for it? >> the richest among us who can  afford it pay their fair share  in taxes. it is not right that teachers  and nurses and firefighters are  paying a higher tax rate than  billionaires and the biggest  corporations. >> joining us now is pollster  and strategist frank luntz who  watched that interview. what was your reaction for  somebody who focuses on words. >> first off, she is now, but  took a while, but she is now  taking the tough interviews and  asked the tough questions and  being challenged. "60 minutes" did an outstanding  job trying to get answers. secondly, it is donald trump who is ducking debates and the  interview on "60 minutes" and he backed away from. she gets credit for that. third, this is important. she asked the question about pay your fair share. this is language from the  democrats that has gone back 25  years now to al gore in 2000 and no one has yet defined and  harris does not do it here what  exactly is fair share. what is the rate? how much? how do you pay it? it's a legitimate question. i want to give her credit for  one important use of language. in the convention, the democrats talked about freedom. that's normally a republican  issue. here, she calls and asserts i'm  a capitalist. that's something you hear from a republican candidate, not the  democratic candidate. now she is focused on small  business, which has always been  a republican issue. andrew, she is taking pages out  of the republican playbook. she sounds, if you just listen  to the general statements, she  actually sounds like a moderate  republican. so the challenge for the trump  campaign is to stop withcessant  issues and her claims. i'll tell you something, going  to the new york times poll, she  is beginning to cut through. >> that's where i wanted to go  with this next. you're in the polling business  and in the business of reading  polls, if not your own. what do you see happening in the polls in the swing states in  particular? not the national polls,  necessarily, but in the swing  states where both of the  candidates are spending  virtually all of their time. >> it makes sense because  every one of the swing states is within the margin of error. every swing state could end up  in the harris camp or the trump  e camp. with this election with one  month to go is so darn close. i can't find the time or  historical precedent for this  when the two candidates 30 days  out we<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Ramirez: Actual holiday discounts are closer to 30%, not 50%.<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> joining me now with more is  jessica ramirez at jane holley  and associates.  >> good morning. thank you for having me.  >> we said steep discounts. your research shows it varies. a lot of the language is up to  50%. you say the discounts are a  little closer to half that. >> yeah, i think earlier this  year, we talked about this. up to 50%. when you dive in, it's 30% off  actually. then beauty is funny. some retailers are using it as  beauty on sale, but dive in and  it's 15% off. the whole year, we haven't seen  promotions to be high. from our proprietary data, year  over year, the promotions are  down. >> about 30%.  >> 30% is the sweet spot.  >> we had a short port strike. i spoke to analysts about this. the port strike could impact  retailers that do just in time  inventory, but impact the  avail availability. if a tv is a good seller, they  will put it out and buy more  when it comes in. what is the strike -- does that  have an impact on what we will  see on the shelves this holiday  season? >> i've been impressed with  retail with the way they have  been running. we knew the strikes could  happen. because the consumer is spacing  out spending, retailers have  known that. they had product come in and  they well planned it. we feel they are well positioned and we should be fine with  inventory. >> all right. some analysts named abercrombie  & fitch and the gap and others  with inventory. any impact on the margin and  paying higher shipping costs. should that be negatively  impacted by the strike in.  >> abercrombie does have a  vertical. they do the easy, quick buy. gap is better prepared. dollar store is what i worry  about. walmart has the effect on them.  >> let's get back to the holiday deals. according to the research, we  look at electronics and home  goods. we will see 30% discount. when it comes to beauty  products, 15%. what does that say about the  holiday consumer and retailers? >> in terms of electronics, we  had those categories really not  where the consumer has wanted to spend and rightfully so. we have seen promotions come  down in june and july. we are seeing the cycle for  consumers to replenish those  categories. the positive part has been  they've been close to the  consumers, so they have been  adding promotions and playing  with them in terms of what makes more sense so they don't lose  out on margins. in our notes, we noted sales  might have been troubled in  growth there year. they've been 1% or 2%. margins have been high. strategic moves retailers are  doing. >> later today, i'm sure you are aware, a busy day for you. the holiday seales forecast. do we see more sales in the  early deals than last year and  overall, we talked about the  consumer being stretched and  people switching spending  behavior. what are you expecting? >> like i said, these promotions this week, i don't think they  will be crazy. i think it is luring that  customer in and trying to get  some of that. i think the customer has been  shopping early. i think they started. i saw target and walmart start  their sales in september. even earlier than before. i think that's very spaced out. in terms of the holiday season,  we think sales will come in flat or year over year, the growth  from earnings every quarter has  been quite low. the customer is very strapped. so, again, we just feel that's  going to be flat.  >> last question and we have to  go. why do they care about getting  us on the loyalty program? >> you want to continue to bring the customer back in. target's was interesting. the promotions were not  necessarily what they were  luring in. home essentials and <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Ethridge: More cuts are expected—it's baked in.<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> ethridge. malcolm, good morning. congratulations are due right  now. same company, new name and new  role for you. congratulations.  >> i appreciate it. good to see you, man.  >> good to see you. let's get into this. bull market. kind of going better than most  of us expected. ahead of the fed minutes today,  kugler would like to see more  cuts. dh  does that keep the rally going? >> it is. i don't know the market  necessarily is expecting 50  basis points and 50 basis points again to be a good thing, but we are definitely expecting more  cuts through the end of the  year. i think that is baked in to most traders expectations at this  point. >> it is baked in. i want to talk about earnings  when the big banks report. i'm looking at the earnings  esti estimates. lseg sends them every week. they keep on ticking down. if you say the market is  expecting the cuts and the  earnings estimates are going  down, what keeps the rally  going? >> to your point of the big  banks, it is a mistake to think  of them in the terms of the  shareholder. i know that is the metric we  care about with it specifically. in this case, we should pay more attention to the fact that m&a  activity is likely to pick up  after the election regardless of which administration. it will be more friendly to the  business community than the  biden administration has been  the if you are an investor in  banks, you want to hold those  shares and not worry about the  interest spread going forward.  >> malcolm, you mentioned the  financials. one area you are looking at for  opportunities is the bank etf. since the announcement that the  capital requirements, basel end  game, the proposal is half what  it was before. the banks under performed. wasn't that supposed to be a  catalyst for the banks? it already priced in with the  cuts. the benefit of the cuts should  be priced in to financials. lower capital requirements are  not puerterforming. what opportunities are you  seeing? >> i think investors in banks  have traditionally focused on  one metric. the spread between what the bank actually earnings and what they  payout to you, the customers. i think focusing on it based on  that traditional metric is the  reason investors and financials  may be getting this completely  wrong. if you think about the goldmans  or morgan stanleys of the world, where they make their money is  where m&a goes well. those are likely going to come. i think it is a mistake to just  focus on the interest spread and play those rates.  >> that's why it is under  performing. over emphasizing the net  interest income and overlooking  other parts of the financial  story. i want to get to your business. getting people to invest. you are one of many people who  has come on the show and say  money is about to come out of  the money market funds and back  into the market. when you look at the trends, the money markets are growing. latest data from ici, money  market funds have grown 5% since the start of q3. they are almost $6.5 trillion. why do you think the money is  going into money market funds as opposed to going out although a  lot of people think it is coming out? >> i'm concerned that the money  has been staying in the money  markets as long as it has. it is great for an investor who  took gains and said i'll hide  out here and earn 5% risk free  and see what happens. i know some of that money is the investors moving from b of a or  wells fargo seeking higher  yields. the majority is folks who have  taken profits along the way. the mistake is thinking the  party is going to keep on  rolling even though folks like  you and i have been saying for  some time now, okay, rates are  on  going to come down and it is  time to shusift away from the  strategy. jut l just looking at the numbers  ticking up instead of down.  >> malcolm, why did you add that on september 26th to the  portfolio? >> to me, that is the more  likely winner of any tradeoff  out <br>
