Secretary Yellen: We're on a path to a soft landing,2024-09-26 15:27:19+00:00,10,W3rcJ6p3stY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3rcJ6p3stY,"in lower manhattan. steve liesman is live. he's got a very special guest. steve? >> david, thanks very much. i am here a couple blocks away  from you with treasury secretary janet yellen. thank you for joining us.  >> my pleasure. thank for the invitation.  >> they're going to be stability and you will give a speech about stability in the market. some things have seemed to work  out right. are we past the period of time  where you have concerns about  the balance sheets of banks and  their exposure to high interest  rates and what are the risks  you're concerned about. you mentioned in your speech  stable coins, the nonbank  financial sector? >> yes. so we want to make sure through  our work with the financial  stability oversight council and  more broadly that we have a  well-functioning financial  system that can contribute to  growth with respect to the  banking system, i believe it's  well capitalized and we did see  risk materialize a year ago. i think we've dealt with those  successfully. it did show, though, that a  vulnerability is a high level of uninsured deposits in parts of  the banking system and  inadequate access to the  liquidity that's needed to be  able to address deposit runs,  deposit runs large and very  rapid, and so a good deal of  thought is going in to how to  shore up the liquidity, the  access to the fed's discount  window, for banks that do have  insured deposit.  >> [ inaudible ] over $250,000,  congress' mandate not something  you can do broadly under  treasury federal reserve  mandate.  >> i really think this is up to  congress, the fdic issued a  report discussing possibilities. this is for congress. but in terms of access to  liquidity, better functioning of the discount window, making sure that banks are prepared to  borrow from the discount window  quickly, this is something that  the banking regulators can --  are working on in discussing.  >> let's shift andtalk about  the economy, some revisions to  gdp this morning. told us we didn't have two  negative quarters in 2022. generally upward. gross domestic income came  towards gdp which is a kind of  thing only for the wonks in all  of us here. bradley do you see us heading  towards a soft landing and do  you feel like inflation is  sufficiently under control? >> well, i do. i think that all of the  indications we're seeing both in the labor market with respect to inflation and with respect to  growth suggests we're on a path  to a soft landing. of course, there are always  risks. we are seeing a less tight labor market and some growing -- a  little bit more slack in the  labor market that we had  previously. the unemployment rate has  drifted up, low by historical  standards, but hopefully this is going to turn out to be a staple situation with the fed  supporting continued strength in the labor market and inflation  has come down considerably the  last mile on inflation involves  housing costs and i believe  there's good reason to think  that they will fall market rents have declined considerably and  with a lag i think we'll see  housing costs fall further and  take the fed to its 2% target. i've said for a long time i  always believed that there was a path to a soft landing, that it  was possible to bring inflation  down while maintaining a strong  labor market, and to me that's  what the data suggests has  happened.  >> so i know you think a lot  about the fed. but i also know you don't talk a lot about the fed. i've written a crafted question  here to see if you might respond to it. when you think about the level  of rates now relative to the  progress on inflation, do you  think that rates at the fed are  too high? >> well, you do see in the  material in the comments of the  chairman and in the projections  of the members an expectation  that rates will come down more  and that short rates are  currently above neutral, and  when you have an economy that's  growing at potential that's  operating at full employment  with inflation in the vicinity  of the fed's target, that  suggests that a more neutral  stancive policy is apropopropri. the fed has run a policy to  bring inflation down. we've seen considerable progress on that front and yes, i believe over time, if we stay on that  path, that rate ws will decline  against neutral.  >> do you have a path rates get  there.  >> that's getting into details. >> you talked about potential  growth and something that has  been troubling to many market  observers which is that we're at or above potential. we're at or near many estimates  of full employment. yet we're running these very  large deficits. can you explain why that is and  how the administration justifies these large deficits with the  economy doing as well as it  seems to be doing? >> well, i think the metric we  should be looking at is to  decide on the sustainability of  fiscal policy is real net  interest costs as a share of  gdp. and historically that's been  under 2%. it is under 2%. over time, if we don't do  further deficit reduction, it  would be likely to drift up. so i think looking forward, it  will be necessary to get  deficits down and to do some  deficit reduction in order to  keep the interest costs  manageable. the president, president biden,  and vice president harris,  presented fiscal 2025 budget  that has considerable deficit  reduction. something like $3 trillion over  the next ten years.  >> i've seen that, but if you  can't get the revenue, isn't it  prudent not to do the spending? >> well, i think it's important  to be on a fiscally sustainable  course. the approach that our  administration is taking is that we want to be able to invest in  ways that will boost growth and  do so in an equitable way  whether it's investing in  industries of the future, in  places that haven't had  opportunity, addressing housing, child care, things that are  boosted the cost of living and  made life very difficult for  middle-class families. so we want to invest in the  country and be able to do that  afford that, by raising enough  revenue to be able to pay for  those things. and we've made some progress. we do have now a corporate  alternative minimum tax that  went into effect. we have started to bring down  the cost of pharmaceuticals,  which both loewers the cost of  living for families and also  saves the government  considerable amounts of money. importantly, we've basted the  resources of the internal  revenue service so they can both improve customer service and i  think anybody who's dealt with  the irs over the last year or  year or two, can see that. but also, begin to close the tax gap which is the enormous gap  between the revenues that are  being collected and what was  estimated to be due.  >> all that said, do you regret  over the course of the pandemic, and its aftermath given to what  happened to inflation, not  having reduced spending so that  you weren't adding to that  inflation? >> look, i think at the outset  of the administration we felt  that the largest single risk  facing our economy was that  people would not get back to  work in a timely way, and we  could be faced with a real  crisis of high unemployment with substantial scarring. and we put in place with  congress a program that was  meant to address that risk. every developed country saw a  surge in inflation. ours was no worse than other  countries experienced. inflation has come down more  quickly and we've had a more  robust recovery than other  countries, so there's no  question that inflation has been a problem, it remains the top  priority of our administration,  to address the high cost of  living that burdens households. but inflation now is d","Category: Macro

>> because the country, she  believes and knows the country  needs to come together.  >> what do you think about  neither of these candidates talk about the debt or deficit ever? >> that's --  >> a great giveaway and the  question is who's giving away  more? >> yeah. yes and no. >> a competition going on.  >> she was straightforward  raising tax. corporate 28%. still cheaper than a tariff plus 20%.  >> wouldn't you personally  rather stay at 21%? >> doesn't affect me one way or  the other.  >> not you. for everybody else.  >> the country.  >> no. you have to look at the deficit. revenue --  >> not where the, i don't think  that's where we should go.  >> where would you go for it  then? >> taxing his loans he takes on  billions.  >> and i don't do that. right? >> you know the people that  are --  >> when interest rates were near zero everybody did that. can't make more than 1% on your  return, it was easy to, right? with interest rates at 4, 5%  makes no sense. do that and she's not opposed to it but not generating as much  money. a lot more revenue available  from taxes on stock buybacks. taxes on these, think where the  cash structure is in a company. you have something to invest in  r & d whatever you do it. a company to buy or people to  hire, do it. can't find a better way to  invest capital, you buy back  shares. so it's really saying, okay. tax the buybacks creating a ton  of revenue to reduce the  deficit, and create a ton of  revenue or change business  behavior. yesterday a guest on saying we  saw the good stock buybacks then with prices at high levels saw  bad ones, too. pointed that out.  >> always bad ones.  >> high levels. if it does that, changes  corporate behavior you won't  have revenue, assumed from it? >> fine. invested in it or paying  dividends. pushes them towards dividends. suggested, i don't know if  they'll do it. family of four, if you have  income under $89,000 div dead  are tax-free. bump up that amount to 250 or  $400,000. a higher tax rate on stock  buybacks pushes dividends,  tax-free money goes into the  economy. microsoft did a special dividend millions of dollars 20 years can impacted gdp. having big companies put money  back in the dividends and now  investors truly buying because  they get a return instead of  hoping the market goes up,  that's not a bad thing either.  >> industrial policy? one of the things she talked  about investing in a number of  different industries in a big  way.  >> a big way.  >> the next ten years? some say shouldn't have steel  policy like this and tried it  before, a mistake. others say we need to.  >> different world. our military dominance, our  place in the world depends on  our ain'bility to invest in a.i. whoever wins in a.i. has the  best military. no question about it. period, end of story. private companies invest a lot,  the department of defense  obviously invest lots. we need to do more. we cannot lose that battle or we lose everything. that defines our currency, how  we competed in the world,  defines our military. interesting in that is critical. >> a piece out recently there  has not been a manufacturing  boom. there was, postpandemic for a  year, but it's been bad. been bad the past few years. ism, index, contracting since  2022 right when the i the i.r.a  passed. my theory.  >> winners and losers.  >> intel. we decide intel can't get out.  >> tsmc making 5 millimeter  nano, whatever chips already. that's needed. critical, right?

a good tariff, a bad tear of? >> part is you don't just throw  around the idea of just tariffs  across the board and that's part of the problem with donald  trump. frankly, i'm, i say this in all  sincerity. he's just not very serious how  he thinks about some of these  issues. and one must be serious and have a plan and a real plan that's  not just about a talking point  ending in an exclamation at a  political rally, but actually  putting the thought into what  will be the return on the  invest? what will be the economic impact on everyday people? >> a lot of ground to cover with our next guest. bringing in mark cuban for  takeaways. a billionaire and entrepreneur. curious where you stand. listening to her, you called in  a couple weeks what you thought  she would would be telling the  public and we quizzed you. went back and forth about just  how much you knew versus what  the public knew. how much more do you think the  public knows now and how much  more do you think the public  should know?

to here we are. 50 days later from where she  started. she's at worse tied. right? people on her economic policy,  she was behind trump 25%. now she's behind 11%. so she's making progress. if she just continues along that trend. the trend is her friend. it means she's doing the right  things. she'll keep on communicating new in ideas, new elements. a lot more specific or tariffs  where she stands. the difference between her and  donald trump to her point. donald trumpwill say what fits  to the audience. when you talk -- when i talk to  her team about differ things. whether health care, tariffs  whatever it may be she goes back her team does a full analysis. doesn't just say yes or no. they dig into what she says. impacts.  >> a critique she will say  whatever the audience wants. look at the tipping it thing  that took place in nevada. given some of the details we  don't have on certain things, is that because some of those  details would be less favorable  in terncertain audiences?

number one shows are all fox. number one podcasts --  >> even in spite of that able  to --  >> no spite of that -- yeah. main stream media is not who you think it is. the mainstream media truly leans right.  >> why it's only tied then?

okay? are they going to do the easing  measures that you want them to  do? so, yeah. came the other day and, what's  his name? pan -- pan gongching. apologize. i can't even speak english well. he came out and was, like,  jovial. like, whoa! jovial saying we're going to cut and we're going, give you more. he said, we'll dough more, and  more. as needed. now, the chinese, to say we'll  do more and more if needed, they don't say that, because it's not been healthy to say those sort  of things in china, but they  said that the other night and i  have listened carefully what  government officials say. so i took it that they did a  lot. they exceeded expectations and  he promised to do more and more  and more. okay? that's very strange language  especially for any central  banker especially over there. that was the first thing that  happened. and last night, you know, we  heard they were going to have a  meeting but kind of blew away  expectations on the fiscal  stimulus. you know? that they were going to do. fiscal stimulus look at your  charts, used to be a broker, a  good way to do things fast. what can happen around the world when they do that jl now you  have the fed -- backdrop. fed easing a few more easings  coming. japanese don't know what they  want to the do now. doesn't matter. they'll be forced into things. i can talk about that later. european lowering rates. chinese lowering rates. aggressive how they're doing it  and believe it or not, swap  facilities to buy stocks. encouraging buyback of stocks. encouraging buybacks of stocks. okay? this is china. buybacks, encouraging it,  lending you money to do it and  given money, you can put money  out and have no losses. if you want to do it. you have, you know how that  works? money you put up and don't lose  money. that's a great deal for me. i want to be over there for some of this stuff.  >> what about this relationship  between the united states and  china? how the chinese government may  or may not feel about american  investors. more importantly how the  american government feels about  u.s. investors investing in  china, too? what's the risk? >> limits on how much you would  invest. >> say you don't have limits? >> the other thing i thought  you'd ask about tariffs, stuff  like that. i do not care. this is internal stimulus. in the fiscal stimulus they did  last night encouraging  consumptions directly saying it. so really doing all the things  that people have asked them to  do over these years. so what will happen in world  markets? talk with the united states,  most viewers here in the united  states.  >> and japan. started on japan.  >> go around the world. obviously this is incredibly  good for very undervalued  chinese equities. okay? especially when the government's encouraging buybacks. buybacks and take risk to buy  stock. take out a loan buy stock can't  lose money on your loan. great deal for me, if you want  to be chinese. is sorkin a chinese name? no. anyway -- sorry. the united states, that's -- you have a world. trying to figure the united  states, it's not really your  first plug to go to invest right now, because you would say china first, asia second. right? asia at large second. japan -- then japan. korea. those markets. also actually asia and europe. and europe. before japan. tell you -- tell you why. the problem with, you know, you  have to be careful. a little bit about japan,  although i think still you want  to be in the equities markets. if you look what happens. if china runs -- get the economy going and get the animal spirits going, what happens? chinese throw a lot of money in  their economy. who's one of the biggest  beneficiaries in their own  economy? it's japan. japan, if they start running  faster, i don't care what this  election is and they have their  worried about this candidate,  that candidate. ship candidates might want to  the go to abenomics. i don't care. they don't understand it yet. this happened last night. the market doesn't understand it yet. what's going to happen? japan will run too fast if they  stimulate that. they run too fast they have to  raise rates. when they raise rates the yen  will appreciate. if the yen appreciates, then you have to be careful about the  stock market. not the -- depending how it  goes. the stock market in yen terms,  you should still make money. how much does it move or not  because of how it historically  does. right? go around the world. the u.s., listen, the problem  with the u.s. --  then i could go european. european -- the european index  at 14 times multiple versus the  22. historically incredibly wide. >> 22 here.  >> 21, 22. whatever you want to say for  next year.  >> europe --  >> interest.  >> like last --  >> japan has the same sort of  multiple now. we have much better stocks, big  other tech stocks. the question, you don't have the a cheap market necessarily. it's not a cheap market. it probably -- i didn't listen  to him. listened a little. cooperman said yesterday. look historically a little  overvalued. i would say that. however, i get concerned about  one thing. because fortunately or  unfortunately, i was around in  the '90s, in the '80s, too, but  around the '90s, and that  market, where the fed -- cut  rates into y2k, a good economy. a relative, not a bad comeconom. relative okay economy. you had rich and -- before  long-term credit. rich in '97. richer after long-term credit  and bubble mania in the '99  early 2000. so i don't love -- i'm a value  guy. i don't love the u.s. markets on a value standpoint but sure as  heck won't be short. nervous as heck about the setup  with easy money everywhere. relatively good economy. you know, and massive stimulus  coming in. it would make me nervous not to ","Category: Macro

SEC Chair Gary Gensler on crypto: This field will not long persist without investor protection,2024-09-26 12:41:51+00:00,10,Rl628OFEGWA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl628OFEGWA,"lower cost, lower risk.  >> one could make the case --  both sides don't like you you're probably a good regulator,  right? >> there you go, joe.  >> i'm throwing you bones.  >> what is your take on the  argument -- especially around  crypto but other things as  well -- that rather than create  new rules or even new laws that  might have to be put into effect you have effectively regulated  through legislation? that is a huge --  >> we don't legislate.  >> i understand that you don't  legislate. but that rather than have  legislation or push for  legislation or even implement  rules that could be -- with real sort of bright lines if you  will, that what's happened here, especially in the crypto world,  is that it's been done through  the form of legislation -- not  legislation, through lawsuits  effectively.  >> so what we are, we are a law  enforcement agency and congress  set us up to be. we oversee the markets and  approve all those registrations  when people go public and so  forth. but we also -- that's 700 plus  times a year bring actions -- we have to go in front of a judge  and sometimes juries, so now it  brings it back to this new  innovation and what satoshi  knack ka moto did, we're almost  at october, 16th anniversary,  16th birthday of bitcoin and  it's an innovation. but innovations don't long  thrive if they don't also build  trust. i mean the automobile wouldn't  have survived if you didn't have traffic lights, if you didn't  have stop signs and even cops on the road to make sure there  weren't accidents. so that's part of our role is  being the cops on the beat and  the rules are about the traffic  lights to make sure. so in crypto, you want to raise  money from the public, there's a basic idea that you put out  fundamental disclosures, so that the investing public gets to  choose.  >> is your argument that you're  doing this to make crypto  stronger? >> we're -- we're merit neutral. crypto is only a small part of  our capital markets. i mean it's a little less than  1% to the world capital markets. but it's basically to instill  trust and protect investors. look at the leading lights in  this field in the crypto field  two years ago. a number of them are in jail  right now. i'm not just talking about sbf. a number of others. tens of billions of dollars of  losses and bankruptcies and so  forth. what field in america innovative field in america, survives  without having building trust in that field? and protecting investors who are consumers if you're selling  cribs or something, you don't  want people to have a problem  with the cribs.  >> what we've heard from both  candidates running in this  election, first from candidate  trump and then from candidate  harris, is that they're going to be opening the doors probably  and being more open to what  crypto -- crypto enthusiasts  would like to see. does that pose a problem, or are the rules kind of laid out at  this point, the ground rules? >> i'm not going to comment on  elections. i'm in a role --  >> not elections. on the policies. >> i love that too --  >> i'm not asking for a comment  on the election. just the policies both  candidates seem to be embracing. >> on the policies it's quite  clear that investor protection  helps build innovation. innovation is compatible with  investor or consumer protection  if it's about automobiles or  cribs or anything else. i think they complement each  other. i said this when i was teaching  back at m.i.t., i said, this  field will not long survive if  you can't build that investor  trust in the markets.  >> does the idea of a looser  policy concern you? >> i think we have a time tested set of laws and rules in our  securities markets. basic things. investors get to decide, but  they get disclosure. roosevelt called it the truth in securities act. the basic idea we're in this  building the nasdaq exists. nasdaq doesn't have the conflict of also running a hedge fund,  trading on the market and those  conflicts inside of those. and so it's sort of like  ensuring you get the disclosures and you're protected against,  you know, kind of the insiders  rigging the game.  >> some argument to be made that actually it would be better if  all this business happening in  the u.s., sbf, taking place in  the bahamass, a lot of people  were trying to do things in  other places. if there was a real regime here  that everybody could trust and  we had established rules and  there weren't these questions  about whether you were going to  over -- go over the line or  behind the line, where the line  was, would that be better? >> i think that we do have those rules.  >> you think those lines exist. why then do people in the  industry say that they don't  know what the rules are? >> look, not liking the rules is not the same as that there  aren't rules. i think there's a lot that have  profited off of the public's  interest in this field but  profited without the proper  disclosures and inherently  there's business models that  are -- have a lot of conflicts. we've seen the results of that  time in and time again, outside  of crypto and inside much  crypto. we see what happens when there's inherent conflict. wecht 90 years of experience  with this, andrew. it works reasonably well. we have the deepest, most liquid capital markets we're trying to  make them more efficient what  we're doing in the equity  markets. >> i think you're warming up to  top tier crypto. that's my take.  >> what's that? >> i think you're warming up to  top tier crypto. i don't think you think it's a  monolith. i think you think there might be some actual usage or benefit to  top tier crypto? would you say -- recently you're evolving to where -- go ahead.  >> joe, where why you on what's  called altcoins. there's 15 or 20 --  >> where are you j.  >> when you came in, you said  own bitcoin, you don't own all  the garbage you were thinking. >> garbage was your word.  >> are you worried --  >> it was not that kind of a  word that you --  >> actually that's right.  >> joe, for the public used a  stronger word than garbage.  >> if did.  >> are you warming up -- do you  see it's here to stay and  something that could be useful? >> this is something i said to  students four and five years  ago.  >> i know. you didn't say it once you were  the sec chairman.  >> that this field will not long persist without investor and  consumer protection. many of these projects without  prejudging any one are tapping  into the public's interest to  raise money. that's the classic securities  sort of --  >> right.  >> protections you put in place. you can -- you can decide to go  long or short these projects,  but you need the disclosures. as it relates to bitcoin, my  predecessor and i have said  that's not a security. you now have a way that you can  actually express that view, buy  into that through exchange  traded products, trade it on  nasdaq, trade it on new york  stock exchange and the like.  >> okay. that's a yes then. if we -- where do you think  bitcoin is going to be in our  society 20 years from now? if you were to sort of --  >> i don't, i don't know. i mean there's 7 billion people  around the globe. i'm not going to make a  prediction as to any one  project. but what i would say is the  field is going to have a  challenge building trust.  >> right.  >> and it already has a  challenge building trust when  there's so many fraudsters,  scammers, grifters in the field  and there are.  >> what happens if, for example, former president trump is  talking about whether we should  have effectively a bitcoin  reserve fund, a sovereign  bitcoin fund? would you be in favor of  something like that.  >> again i'm --  >> take the politics out of it. i'm asking, you know, if -- if  someone in congress came to you  and said, hey, gary, we're  thinking of creating a sovereign wealth fund in bitcoin, would  you say that's a good idea, bad  idea? >> i would say i'm going to  stick to the role i'm in. it's a great role overseeing --  >> but it can't --  >> chair of an agency --  >> you're a smart guy who knows  a lot about this space, taught  about this space. you should -- i imagine you have a view. you don't feel like you can  share the view. i don't believe you have a view. >> i have a view. i have a view.  >> the role, given your role  you're not supposed to say?

30, maybe 40? what exactly is fair share? >> we debate that all the time.  >> the issue is it is a sound  bite and slogan. i know i'm a messaging person. that's my job. however, the public requires a  detailed action and they are not getting it from her. she is addressing housing and  she is addressing health care  and food and fuel, she is doing  the policy. in terms of the communication,  i'll give you an example,  pragmatic versus common sense. pragmatic shows she will do what is smart polling wise and  politically. the public says if you raise  taxes, tell us where it's going  to come and tell us the impact  which is what they're looking  for and in the end, let us keep  a little bit more of what we  make and let us be just a little bit more affordable in how we  live. i'll give you a second example. we're positive toward her. there's too much donald trump  focus ed on the past and trying  to get even. she is focused on the future. she uses the language that  businesses will and i quote  define the next century. that's what the public wants. looking forward, not backward. this is where trump is weak. however, she only talks about  good union jobs. we're all hard working  taxpayers. we're all part of this economy. for her at this close to the  election, the focus on the  specific group, is not helpful  of when the economy affects  everyone. >> i saw that speech yesterday  and then the interview and her  comments about being a  capitalist --  >> this is a negative, by the  way.  >> wanting free and fair markets and competitive markets, i  thought this was -- we talked  about whether she has turned to  the center. again, we're lacking specific  details of what the tax plan is. i think you are getting  directionally a lot more sense  of what the way she is thinking  about it is. yes, it may be different than  some of her comments three and  four years ago.  >> it was trying to go to the  center and businesses where she  has been criticized heavily.  >> i'm a moderator of focused  groups. this was driven by focused  groups. it doesn't feel like it was her, herself. it felt like someone went  through the speech like me and  added a few phrases.  >> i interviewed her last year  and i talked to her before and i actually thought this was very  similar if you go back and watch that interview we did a year  ago, this was closely. this was one of the first  interviews or comments where she was speaking to business people  in a way she hadn't thus far.  >> if you repeat yourself three  times, which is what she did,  you know it's a line. you know it's not something they really feels. there's so much she wants to put out. i'm looking at that language to  be able to tell whether it's  authentic or whether somebody  like me gave it to her.  >> focus groups. democrats love the group that  corporations are price gouging. there's a piece -- to me when it came out and it seemed like the  most ridiculous assertion with  elizabeth warren and they don't  use actual data. they skew it for their own  design. all of her ads i see now,  they're doubling and tripping  down on i'm going to stop the  price gouging. it's all a smoke screen to get  around what caused the  inflation. people, the democratic  rank-and-file eat that up. that's what we hear between now  and then. she finally talks and it's to  someone the week before who said she shouldn't do interviews on  bill maher? >> you are explaining what is  correct and what the american  people are most hostile to  companies and ceos and people  that do this show. here's the issue, does it affect you the moment you wake up in  the morning to the moment you go to sleep at night? is this the impact on how you  live your life? it is not standard of living,  but it is about quality of life. the public right now is  suffering. they literally can't --  >> i'm suffering from all the  political ads from the moment i  get up in the morning until i do to bed. >> you are? >> on tv. >> not here.  >> in new jersey.  >> you are in the swing state of new jersey? >> i'm not a swing state. i like what i hear. i see the guy like ken langone. >> the key is is it meaningful,  significant and measurable so  you can prove it? the key with her is she is not  giving us a detailed plan of  action. the issue with trump, because we have to be fair on this show,  the issue can trump is he is  talking too much about the past  and not the future. here's the amazing thing because i want to come clean this show. i thought trump was out of it  after the debate. i thought he was given so many  opportunities to talk about  affordability and he blew it. >> people are locked in, frank. no one changed from that debate. you are not seeing ads. i watch fox. you don't know where that is.  >> trump is still in this even  with that performance. he still could pull this out.  >> pull it out? in gallop.  >> i know you believe he is  going to win. i believe she has the advantage  t.advantage. it is all about affordability. two words. am i safe and secure over  immigration and can i afford the things i want, need and deserve  and those are the only issues  that matter.  >> a question about that. trump is obviously very clear on the immigration piece. clearer, arguably, than she is,  i think is fair to say. on the affordability piece, who  do you think is clearer? she talks about housing, she  talks about giving money to  small businesses. is that the piece of it that you think is going --  >> this is where he's done a  good job. if she couldn't do it over the  last three and a half years,  what makes you think she will do it the next four?

Kevin Brady",2024-09-26 11:59:58+00:00,8,NWRJBk3Edxs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWRJBk3Edxs,"spectators. >> the trump tax cuts are set to expire next year and have become a campaign issue for both  candidates. our next guests have worked on  the tax cuts and jobs acts and  plans for what comes next. kevin brady former republican  congressman of texas who served  as chair of the house ways and  means and he and spokesman  forget alliance of competitive  taxation and congressman brad  schneider a democrat from  illinois a member of the ways  and means tax subcommittee. i know you are both very  focuseden what happens for next  year. i think that is the biggest  question. will these cuts be exended? will they be changed in some  significant way? i honestly don't know the  relationship between the two of  you. i'll ask. former congressman brady,  congressman snyder, do you two  work together? did you work together on the  ways and means committee to get  some of these things done? >> we work very well together. i was on the committee for two  terms with chairman and before  that ranking member brady. i think one of the things about  ways and means historically,  it's a committee that has taken  its job very seriously. people on both sides of the  aisle find ways to work  together. we don't always agree, but we  try to find compromise and it  was an honor to work with kevin  for the two terms we shared the  committee together.  >> kevin, let me ask you, where  is the common ground on this? i know this is going to be a  battle? if you two have worked together  and seen common ground where is  the common greened for what we  might see next year.  >> first want to echo brad's  comments. it's a serious committee and  serious topics we work on too  important to be dysfunctional. brad and i have worked together  and you'll see a lot of that on  the committee. a lot is at stake in 2025 and  neither party gains by letting  the tax cuts expire. $4 trillion, lots on families,  small businesses, so finding a  way will be really important. i think the common ground is  certainly the middle-class tax  cuts which are strongly  supportive. i think the new small business  deduction had a big impact on  this, on the economy, main  street businesses as well. i think there's common ground on some issues like the child tax  credit, for example. innovation. how we drive more research, more intellectual property in the  u.s. how do we compete and win  against china, you know, and our foreign competitors. i think is common ground. there are big differences. i think the corporate is -- my  sense is people are shooting at  corporations that are going to  hit workers because the corporate rate, we've lowered  it, drove the three highest  years of real wage growth, 9%,  highest since we've ever  recorded that data, so my worry  is, raising those taxes on  corporations good for china and  foreign competitors trying to  win, but really i think hammers  both those small and mid sized  suppliers and certainly the  workers.  >> congressman snyder let's talk about that point in particular. you were in favor of bringing  the rate down from 35% back in  2017. >> i was. but i think in 2017 the congress overshot. what happened with tax bill 2017 is we saw an increase in our  deficits and an explosion in our debt, not the only reason but a  significant contributor. we have to have a corporate tax  rate that ensures that our  companies, u.s. companies, are  competing globally, that we're  able to make the investments in  innovation in r&d as kevin said, make sure these companies are  continuing to invest in their  workforce and that as a nation  we're able to invest in our  children with child tax credit  helping families pay for child  care so they can get into the  workforce. there's things we can do. i think the corporate tax rate  is something that will be  discussed but whatever we do  needs to make sure american  companies are competitive in a  global economy.  >> i mean, congressman,  corporate tax receipts are way  ahead of where they were now in  2000. way ahead. whenever the biden  administration touts the  economic successes that they've  enjoyed in certain respects, not wage growth, obviously, how do  you know some of that didn't  have to do with going to 21% on  the corporate rate or some of  the other preventions of 2017? >> you can make arguments that  it had to do with a lot of  different things. i think corporate tax rate at  35% clearly too high. at that time we were talking  about bringing the rate down  between 25 and 28%. as people are looking at  corporate rates today, i don't  think anyone is talking about  going back to 35. there are folks talking about  raising it to different levels.  >> you think we should do 15? >> corporate rate is incredibly  pro growth.  >> 15.  >> 28% takes us to the back of  the pack again.  >> how do you --  >> look, my focus would be on  extending the tax cuts, you  know, at the current level,  mainly because -- but don't do  15 then --  >> everything you can do to  improve the economy great. my point do not take us  backwards on growth and the  research and innovation that  brad talked about we all agree  on, the tax cuts delivered that. >> you don't agree with 15%  either.  >> look, i think all that is  helpful, but the thing i would  start with --  >> how do you pay for it? >> yeah. let's grow what we got --  >> specifically you're sticking  to 15%. >> look i think --  >> you think it's a mistake to  go to 15.  >> no, it's not.  >> not a mistake.  >> can you afford to extend  what's very pro growth and pro  worker now.  >> so what would you cut to pay  for that.  >> that's the key for congress  here is how are you -- there's a $4 trillion gap in extending all of them and i think that's going to be the big question on do  they extend it all at once or do they do it in steps? you know what i mean. beyond next year. i think that's going to be a big issue.  >> congressman snyder put you in the hot seat as well, you want  to keep -- you would like to  bring back the s.a.l.t.  deductions, get rid of the limit on that, and that's another  budget buster. how would you pay for that? >> first let's talk about  principle. the tax on state and local taxes is a double tax aigs and i don't think anyone should be paying  taxes twice and where i agree  with kevin we need to make sure  we're competitive. our revenues this year are going to be about through the current  year at $4.4 trillion but we're  spending almost $6.3 trillion. that's a $1.9 trillion deficit. we can't sustain that. we have a $35 trillion deficit  growing to $50 trillion  according to c.b.o. we need a responsible approach  to taxes. i think it needs to be  bipartisan. i think it needs to stand the  test of time. the 2017 bill is back on the  table because it didn't have  that long-term perspective. so whatever we do has to be  something that does drive  growth, create opportunities for american families, make it  easier for families to pain  their expensings, invest in  their future and secure their  retirement and responsible that  it funds our government. we should be talking about how  much do we want to","Category: Politics

Mukherjee: The projected energy demand is huge... it's going to double in the next few years,2024-09-26 11:42:05+00:00,6,gsSfS6YI084,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsSfS6YI084,"operate that tech also requires  massive amounts of energy. i'm joined by the global head of sustainability at nokia. good to have you. >> thanks for having me, frank.  >> nokia. you are working on a.i. and  stability. a big issue going forward. i'm looking at your data. the mission footprint of the  landscape doubled over the last  15 years. obviously, a.i. data centers use a lot of power. tell me where you see the trend  going and how can we make it  sustainable? >> look, the project of energy  demand is huge depending on the  study you believe in. it's going to go double the next few years. let me break down the issue in  two areas. one is the energy consumption in the data centers itself. this is where the discussion at  the new york climate week has  happened and much of the  concerns from the environmental  specialists and technology has  been. nokia has been working with data providers on this issue. we announced a deal last week  which is put be hyper scaler  cloud in the data centers. we are working with them to  build a huge wide area  infrastructure in the u.s. as  well as europe to get to 30%  more traffic in the data centers with the same energy. that is the same part. the second part is to be able to get the data traffic carrying  the a.i. workload from the  device to the data center. this is where networks come in. i like to say this is where a  lot of the innovation and  networking has happened in the  last few years. we have come up with chip sets  which have been reducing the  energy consumption between 60%  to 75% over the generations. on top of that, our renowned  research labs has been working  on six technologies which is  trying to address the traffic  growth 10x and reducing the  energy consumption in half. >> we are getting a bit into the weeds. it sounds like you are saying  there are specific points to  reduce energy consumption and  chips is this area.  >> it is.  >> what can we do to reduce  energy consumption because we  need more power to run the data  centers? >> that's right. of course, there is a lot of  innovation that goes into the  silicon which reduces the power  consumption beat at the level or i.p. level. the chips that are manufactured  are working on that. i would also draw the attention  to not just the chip set level,  but how you use a.i. in the  infrastructure. today, a lot of the energy  consumption in the network ises  in devices and not using the  data consumption. we are working to make sure when a network is not used, the power consumption goes down. a.i. has been useful. >> let's talk about this more  broadly. according to your data, by 2030, the amount of power you use is  9% of capacity. how can you make that amount of  power sustainable? is that going to come from solar power or wind farms? what is the method to power this much when it comes to data  centers? >> yeah, it is a huge challenge  for every economy and there's  lots of public policy  interventions that are needed to get there. i would like to point out the  sector with power and other  sectors which are the higher  greenhouse gas emissions are  consuming a lot of power as well as greenhouse gas emission. this is where nokia has been  working also with many of the  industrial customers. we are trying to bring the power of digitalization to physical  industries like the industries i mentioned. nokia has been working with 760  enterprises around the world to  put this networking in their  networks. including many in the energy  sector. that energy sector  transformation using the d digitalization is enabling them  to make that happen. we launched the sustainability  calculator. it helps companies, including  ener","Category: Technology

"The increased market volatility is still here, says Fairlead Strategies' Katie Stockton",2024-09-26 11:40:34+00:00,8,HKUReq8rbT0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKUReq8rbT0,"stock futures. sharply higher thanks this time  to chip stocks in a rally with  the big gain this china. third straight gain for china  stocks. joining us now is katie stockton from fairlead. we got the 50 basis points,  katie. this move today is already in  the rear-view mirror. i guess that's why it's called  news. you don't care about  fundamentals. this has to do with what micron  said about demand. this does, for whatever reason,  it gives maybe some underlining  strength to where the averages  are. the spx specifically. >> that's right. the s&p 500 did ultimately  confirm a breakout to new highs. the former resistance was 5,670. the breakout can allow for a  measured move projection of  about 5,935. it does act as a positive  technical catalyst. our recommendation has been not  to chase a rally and we stand by that today even with strength  carrying over from micron to  broader technology stocks. we feel that the risk/reward  isn't great when you look at the risk and support levels. the support is just shy of 5,400 at it time. that feels uncomfortable to us. if you look at the chinese stock market, the indices have a base  long-term development for china. we do also at the same time on a short-term basis have new  counter trend signals. the hang seng index today has a  new counter trend signal to the  market indicators suggest we can wait to add exposure for pull  back to take advantage of it. >> the -- in terms of how we  view the market and whether  we're complacent or not, katie,  we're in such a different plac , than where we were in 2022 and  2023, katie, where everyone was  looking for the retest of the  lows. 3,500. mike wilson was down to 3,000  with the worst-case scenario. we almost doubled. a guy named canterwitz who said  i just know earnings will be --  they're just obvious. he's at 3,000. now every day it goes up, no one says boo. we're up again and headed to  6,000. how did that happen? you didn't turn bullish for a  long time either, katie. you stuck way too long with the  retest. >> we did. we don't like to stay wrong for  too long. you know, the up trend is  obviously very, very strong. it has momentum and breadth. the participation has been very  good. so, as a technical analyst, it  has been difficult to feel  bearish at all. we have the yield curve having  uninverted. when you look over history,  that's not a great thing for the stock market nor the economy. we feel there are risks here and the risks in the charts that we  haven't seen since about 2021  ahead of the bear market cycle. from the longer-term  perspective, we're somewhat  cautious. we're not looking for a bear  cycle, but more of a range bound environment based on the  longer-term signals that we do  see. sideways markets are among the  toughest to take advantage of. the rotations become very  important if you are trying to  generate any alpha in that  environment because you can't  just buy and hold and benefit  from the trend in the way we  have done recently.  >> i can give you so many  reasons to sort of feel  uncomfortable fund thamentally  whether it is the consumer. i know the fed says don't read  anything into the 50-basis point cut. it still makes me think the  labor market could deteriorate  more than people are thinking. i don't know how you feel about  that. i would not anannualize this  return and say we're up 5% 35%. >> this is the time people think about returns for the next year. i would say mid single digits in terms of what i'm seeing. not all a year like this year. i think a lot of that comes from the increased volatility with  those things you highlight  there. the  increased volatility is style  here. the vix is above the 200-moving  day average which shifted u
e upside. that does tend to be market  positive long term. we'll see more volatility from  more of an intermediate term  perspective two months up or two months down. that type of thing. i think it will be difficult to  take and in that environment, be more short-term in our position  to succeed. >> if you had to look at one  canary in the coal mine, if  crude got below $64, you talk  about that support. i don't know, is the bond  market -- what if long rates  continue to stay high even after we get the cuts? what would be something that  would signal trouble to you for  equities? the russell looks good. >> i think we already have that, hon honestly, if you go back and  look at the rate cuts. i feel we have that more from  the macro perspective. from the macro technical  perspective, it is all about  rates and secondarily, nvidia. nvidia has a triangle formation  on its chart to test the upper  boundary of it with the micron  news. we have a real proof point for  nvidia. they give way to increased  volatility, but they don't give  you the direction it's going to  come in. if we get the breakout from the  triangle formation, that would  be market positive and  conversely, that breakdown would be market negative.  >> okay, katie stockton, you  don't sound ve","Category: Macro
