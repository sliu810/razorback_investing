<div><strong>Title:</strong> Warehouses could be a big winner from port strikes, in the short-term<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> as we continue to monitor the  port strike, diana olick has a  fascinating look at a sector  that could see above from the  fallout.  >> a brief bump. we're talking warehouse. this is a short-term play. if it all changes if the strike  goes long term, but warehouses  will see more demand and more  pricing power, as tenants needs  workarounds, according to a new  report from piper sandler. lineage manages food inventory. you may remember cold storage  demand rise during the first  years of pandemic. >> and then terreno raised  prices during the first years of covid for container storage, and then pulled back a bit, but now  they could go back up again. i spoke with prolodgis. they said they are providing  some parking areas. they will continue adjusting  operations, depending on how the situation evolves. this, again, is all if the  strike is short term. if there's a complete port  shutdown, then really everyone  loses, because there's no goods  coming in and out of warehouses  anymore, and that will hit hard. >> you said it's going to be  brief or short term. it may not be.  >> that's what i'm saying. this is a short-term play. >> no ships in port in newark  the day i drove by. all those goods gotta go  somewhere.  >> and they're moving them  around, trying to keep things  where are in the short term. but, again, if this goes long  term, you longer have no  movement in and out of the  ports. then everyone will lose. for now.  >> the only benefit, i wonder if this the fact that in thistory  levels are at high, that many  people front loaded, knowing  this could happen, you wonder if that smooths out the effect.  >> it could in part, but  remember, there's <br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> today bitcoin tests support at the $60,000 level as middle east tensions rise bitwise files to launch an xrp back to etf and georgetown professor jim angel breaks down the crypto policy positions of both presidential [music] candidates welcome to cnbc's crypto world i'm taa mckel cryptocurrencies under pressure this morning a day after a sharp escalation of tensions in the middle east by noon eastern bitcoin slipped 1 % trading at $61,800 ether fell 2.5% to $2,460 and xrp dropped nearly 5% trading at 58 let's stick with xrp as we tackle the top stories bitwise just took a step toward launching what would be the first etf tracking xrp the asset manager submitted a registration filing also known as an s1 to the sec this morning the s1 comes just 2 days after bit wi's registered n xrp trust product in del ware the company's ceo hunter horley announced the development on x this morning saying xrp has been an enduring crypto asset for more than a decade with investor interest since the approval of spot bitcoin etfs in january asset managers have continued to push for crypt backed exchange traded products including the ether etfs now trading on us markets as of july plus applications among some for a salon of backed etf next a federal appeals court ruled that americans can bet on 2024 congressional elections that decision was made in response to the cftc's appeal in a legal battle with production market ki political betting is gaining traction as the us presidential election approaches with more than $1.1 billion doar at stake on poly market a platform that uses crypto tokens for its bet placing system that platform was fined by the cftc in 2022 now poly market doesn't allow americans to bet on its platform now this comes a week after cftc chair russ benham joined cnbc where he said these markets are legal under current law and didn't rule out the possibility of enforcement actions against them before the election the cftc declined to comment on the ruling but noted that it was for the agency's request for an emergency stay not the appeal itself all right sticking with politics for our main story crypto world's mckenzie sigalos spoke with georgetown professor jim angel about both presidential candidates crypto policies and what regulatory changes he expects in the coming months so crypto has become a big part of the conversation in the 2024 election you've got crypto companies outraising big oil and the banks all in the hope of electing candidates up and down the ballot who are pro crypto or at least not anti- crypto and part of that has been about putting someone in the white house who wants to switch things up over at the sec you've got chair gary gendler who's largely viewed by the industry as this major roadblock to growing in the us donald trump has said that he would fire him which he can't exactly do but he could swap in a new chairman how are you thinking about the fate of sec chair gendler under trump versus a harris administration well a lot of people are very upset about sh gensler's activities not just in crypto but in other areas so there are a lot of people would be very happy to see him go however his position as an sec commissioner has a very specific appointment from congress so it is not a political spoils job yes in new chair could be swapped in but there would still be you three democratic commissioners and two republicans on day one so it will take time for a new president to install new people at the sec so that being said if a new chair is swapped in a president trump would likely put in uh one of the republican commissioners who would have a very different agenda and one thing to remember about the sec the chair controls the agenda you know each minority commissioner has five staffers the chair has about 5,000 so in order to get anything done it has to be done with a chair's approval so the only thing the other commissioners do is they get to vote on things but that's about it so if a new chair comes in we might see a very different direction and and that is one question i have so you know let's say we did see this play out where a new chair was swapped in under a new administration what does that mean for ongoing litigation coinbase for example has been uh in the midst of fighting the sec for over a year now well the sec is like a super tanker and it doesn't change course very quickly that uh even when they've made some horrific mistakes they don't like to admit it and you know they just sort of keep on going on their old path so i would be hopeful that a uh uh new regime at the sec would have a more appropriate response to so-called digital assets i'm encouraged that vice president harris has announced her support for digital assets but u the sec has shown even long before chair gendler an inability to come to grips with this new technology and one thing the sec does not understand is a different technology requires a different technology of regulation so for example you know taxi cabs in new york have bulletproof screens to protect the drivers from robbery ubers don't need bulletproof screens because they don't carry cash so when you have a new technology you have to rethink regulation and that's something the sec has been unable to do so it isn't just the chair it's the entire organization that needs an overhaul i want to talk a little bit more about the election i think that crypto focus voters are trying to figure out where the two candidates stand on the issue from your perspective can you lay out how donald trump and kamla harris stack up on the issue of crypto all right the uh donald trump says a lot of crypto people are very angry at the government and uh his uh core is people who are angry at the government and so he sees a natural affinity between his campaign and the crypto crowd so obviously he wants to do things that will please his constituency and also he'd love them to give him money because he loves it when people give him money um on the heris side i think that the vice president understands that the you know prior administration has uh done a very poor job in addressing this new technology and that a reset is necessary um she hasn't come out with any specific details but there's a lot that can be done you know we've seen other jurisdictions come up with approp regulations for digital assets and it can be done in the us you know this is a an amazing new technology it has a lot of promise but there's been a lot of fraud there's been a lot of manipulation we need good regulation the just say no attitude of the sec is not the right way to do it now donald trump and his family have been heavily promoting a def5 project uh that they're a part of called world liberty financial trump's potential conflicts of interest where businesses is concerned has come up in the past do you think that his private businesses in the crypto space specifically create a risky incentive for him to be soft on the industry yes that uh now trump is in it for trump you know trump will do anything to uh scrape up a buck and if he can sell dodgy tokens in something that nobody understands what it does and run away with the money he'll do it on the haris side we finally heard from the vice president with a sort of vague comment encouraging innovation in the space while protecting consumers and investors we know that her team has been meeting behind closed doors with some of crypto's biggest leaders any reaction to kamla harris's approach on crypto and what it might signal from a policy perspective or is it just too little from her at this point to tell either way well it shows a return to common sense because you we have these two extreme views we have the just say no approach of the sec which doesn't work and then we have the anything goes from the traditional crypto people who don't want any government oversight basically what we need is a way to encourage innovation to allow people to innovate and also at the same time make sure that people are selling tokens tell people what's in them that the people who are trading them aren't manipulating the prices that the intermediaries who are uh handling these transactions aren't stealing your money this is why we regulate financial services because of a long long history of of theft and fraud and manipulation and in the past 10 years in the crypto world we have seen all of this which is why a lot of people are very skeptical of the world but the skeptics ignore the fact that this technology is very promising you know we have the ability to overhaul the plumbing and the mechanics of our financial markets in ways that actually improve things for everyone so we want to make sure that we bring in the good innovation well at the same time we stomp out the fraud the manipulation the theft that we've seen and that's why we need good smart regulators who understand the technology who come in with the appropriate technology and who don't just have this well well we'll seee you in court five years from now when we figure out what we want to do attitude which is what the sec has been doing if even a place as slow as the european union can come up with something like their markets in crypto assets directive it we should be able to do it too now you're a market structure guy bitwise just submitted an application for an xrp etf trust in delaware people have been talking about a salana etf in the us meanwhile you've got black rock and others who are pushing for a more robust set of products by pushing for options talk to me about the future of institutional adoption of these crypto products what's the next priority and and where do we go from here right well wall street will sell anything they can make a buck on and uh that's that's what they're good at and they understand as intermediaries that a lot of people really don't want to be messing with private keys and wallets and all that and so they're providing a service they're providing a service of convenience anybody who wants to can basically download wallet software and buy their own bitcoin or ethereum or salana or any of those other cryptos but uh it's a lot simpler just to go tap tap tap on your pre-existing brokerage account now the key thing though is we need to make sure that consumers are being informed as to what those tokens are you know there are thousands of tokens out there some of them quite useful some of them complete frauds and so what we need is good cops on the beat who can allow the law- bing citizens through and put the criminals in jail and right now we have an sec chair who basically views everyone as a criminal okay that's all for crypto world today we'll be back again tomorrow and we'll see you then<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> We're seeing an economy that's slowing, but not stopping, says Annex's Brian Jacobsen<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> this morning we had the better  than expected adp report. for more on what this means for  the markets, brian jacobson is  here. welcome to you. a lot of the economists are  saying when you add it all up,  the port strike, and so forth,  the hurricane effect, that we  could see a big the a  stagflationary q4. what are your thoughts? >> thanks for having me. when we see everything that's on the horizon. chair powell has almost thrown  his arms up in the air. a lot of the data we'll be  getting for the fourth quarter  is filled with all sorts of  distortions. you have the port strike, as you mentioned. we have to see how long the port strike lasts, because they are  going to have to worry, does it  extend past the survey date, so  maybe it will be revolved before then, but higher oil prices, the port strikes could lead to  inflation. you can't see a weakening labor  market, the fed is going to ask  themselves, will they look  through this hand stick to their plan. my guess is powell is probably  convinced they do need to really guess at least two more 25  base-point cuts in, so perhaps  they're a bit on autopilot. >> but autopilot meaning they  continued to cut rates, the  economy continues to expand? i'm interested in how you're  playing with this markets,  financials, by the way, one of  best names in the third quarter. why so? >> yeah everybody i think the  reason is we are seeing an  economy that's slowing, but not  necessarily stops. there are, of course, risksout  there that could lead to a  recession or more dramatic  slowdown. we think the likelihood of those events are fairly low. if we go from really good growth to moderate growth, and are able to stay around here, we think  that sets up a pretty good  environment for, like,  industrials from a valuation  perspective, looks pretty  attractive. we know manufacturing has  effectively been in a recession  for, like, 24 months now  already. if they get more traction. health care also looks  attractive, and as financials,  as the fed continues to cut  rates, that could get good for  funding costs, and take pressure off of the loan books. those are three of the areas  here on our committee we're  optimistic about for the balance of this years.  >> brian, you don't have to give a one side or the other  question, but we have an  election coming up. does it matter to the market how the election turns out? i say that, because watching the v spot debate -- which was  incredibly civil, and kind of  gave you hope, whatever -- it  doesn't seem like the two  economic policies are that much  different. maybe a little adjusting over  h here. we also have congress, probably  nothing will get down no matter  who wins, does the matter care? >> i think the market does care  about the outcome, because there is a scenario, if it's a  democrat sweep, where you could  see a situation where they try  to get rid of the filibuster and are able to get this almost wish list of policies that include an increase in corporate tax rates, the top marginal tax rate really for the markets. the bigger companies, they don't effectively pay that highe tax  rate anyway, so it's more the  smaller caps, so i think it  matters maybe under the hood. regulatory policy use obviously  matter as well. that's a low likelihood you  would get that democrat sweep. if you get divided government,  or some form of rep, if there's  a rep sweep, that's likely to be somewhat business as usual. we'll have to reckon with the  massive fiscal cliff. that is going to be here on  steroids at the end of 2025,  unless they work out whether or  not the tax cuts and jobs act,  those provisions really get  extended. oncewe get through the  election, the market will then  price in the likelihood of that  type of fiscal cliff event  happens. i haven't heard "fiscal clif<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Market Navigator: Playing Conagra to the downside<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> tech is your big leader. when i say big, up 0.2%. still, it is higher. we're in the green, and i get -- i've never done this before. we're doing what's called a  market navigator with dom chu. take it easy on me, it's my  first time.  >> this will be great. we'll take you through the  mapping and the navigation of  the market here.  >> hence the name.  >> conagra is sinks after  reporting disappointing results  earlier today. one of our traders thinking this name could have a continued slow burn even lower. here to splay why and how to  take advantage is mike khouw,  chief strategist over an open  interesting pro. it's down on the heels of  earnings, you think it has more  down side, what's the trade? >> we saw some market expanding  for a number of them, but a lot  of those margins are coming in  again. one of the trades we saw an  institutional trader do today  was the january 30 puts, which  will capture the next earnings  that the company will likely  report in the first week of  january, selling the decembers  to help finance that purchase. one of the things you'll  sometimes see is a follow  through with real money  accounts. those are investors who tend to  be slower moving. endocuments, things like that,  that it takes time for them to  move out of their position. and they had already sold more  than 6 million shares just in  the second quarter of this year  alone. one of the ways i would tweak  the institutional trail, i would reduce those strikes a bit, and  give some play, selling the  december 29s against t. the distinction there is, by  doing that trade, you take in a  small credit. you can't lose any money to the  up side. you would actually make money if it drifts lower, and it would  have to go well below that lower strike for the losses, but that  would represent another 8%  decline. this decline we saw -- the  average earnings moving is only  4%, and we with see it's down  significantly.  >> mike, a follow-up question. why use the calendar spread type of event. what does it do to take those  particular put options and  stagger them. what's the thinking there the  biggest thing that moves stocks, has to report earnings four  times a year. that's when you start seeing big moves. if you're going to sell premium  to advance, it's better to do it when you have expirations that  don't capture earnings. earnings have come and gone, the news was bad, obviously. those december options you would be selling, the only big  catalyst between now and t<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Oil and gas assets will have a multi-year boon cycle, says Rapidan's Bob McNally<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> of the state of hormuz, that all of the liquefied gas flows out  of. we'll get to opec in a minute. i thought we had a scoop, but  they put out a press release. bob, let's start with why oil is not lier. is it lack of retaliation? is it because the saudis had a  spare capacity? or d, all of the above? >> good to be with you, brian. the market is complacent about  geopolitical risks. if you don't see barrels go  off-line, like with libya  recently, they're tired of the  boy that cried wolf. they're hoping we won't see a  material disruption. 20% of world gas comes off rasa  fan, and then 30%, and 17% of  product loadings come out of  that region. they're say, no, boy who cried  wolf, i'm not going to worry  until i see actual physical  damage.  >> let's hope it deescalates for everybody's sake, but the other  day we watched israel light up a yemeni port and oil import  facility. yemen dropped one bomb on israel and tel aviv, and israel just  lit up the entire port. if israel were to do something  similar with iran, or some kind  of oil infrastructure, which i'm sure the white house is strongly deterring them from doing. if they were to do that, bob,  then what? >> if israel hits cry cat  infrastructure from iran, like  oil facilities, the nuclear  complex, i believe that would  trigger a regional war, put all  of the flowing there at risk. we'll measure the increments in  $10 a barrel crew. however, however, we expect not  just the biden administration  pleading and so forth, they make take it easier on the first  retaliatory package. i think it's going to be  suppressing air defenses,  hitting munitions, command and  control, kind of working over  iran, preparing the ground if  they have to go back in future  strikes. i'll be surprised if they throw  that big of a round punch. it will be april, but i don't  think it will be that big.  >> as investors think through  this, there's a lot of value to  find in the energy stocks. maybe you can tell me that's  predicated on higher oil, but  not all of it. it seems like some of these  names should be attractive. where would you be looking to  position in the oil and the  natural gas space for the next  couple months? >> i think we're in a once in a  generation buy unloved oil and  gas assets. the real inflection point will  come when the world realizes  we're not on a track for peak  demand for oil and gas by the  end of the decade. between now and then we could  have an air pocket. macro is awful. china is awful. if there's discipline required,  we could see lower levels, but i think we should position to buy  with both hands for a multi-year boom cyc<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> How Israel would retaliate against Iran's missile attacks<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> israel and the united states  have warned of severe  consequences to iran's missile  attack yesterday. one of our next guests says a  wider war is here, but the  question is how wide? for more on what a response  could look like and the  potential impact to the energy  markets, i'm joined by a senior  fellow at the council on foreign relations, and the director at  energy aspects. charles, i'll begin with you. what are you hearing is the  latest in terms of a possible  israeli response? >> well, as you put it, a wider  war is here. we just don't know how wide. i'm guessing what's going on now in israel is that the leadership is talking to the military  commanders about a menu of  options for retaliation. i think retaliation is a sure  thing. israel does not let these kinds  of attacks go without hitting  back hard. i can imagine a latter of  options, the low end being  asymmetrical responses, a  cyberattack hitting iranian  targets that resparen't in iran  then move into energy and  infrastructure. the third level might be strikes on military targets, command and control in particular, because  the israelis have done a great  job of pulling down hezbollah's  ability to retaliate by hitting  their command and control. the upper range would be strikes on iran's nuclear sites and  strikes on the regime aimed at  toppling the iranian government. at this point, it's difficult to tell --  >> right. >> i think the u.s. is going to  be counseling restraint, don't  go for the full monte, because  we don't want a huge war in the  middle east. >> of course, just to press on  that for a moment, what is the  timeline that we could be  talking about here? sit today, is it hours, or could this retaliation come within  weeks? and why shouldn't israel take  this opportunity to strike at  the heart of iranian oil or  nuclear production? >> i'm guessing days. i think in general, you see  israel hit back pretty quickly  when it gets struck. and there's no question that in  the mind of bebe netanyahu, he's degraded iran's most threatening proxies, hamas in gaza,  hezbollah in lebanon. he may say this is an  opportunity for me to try to  finish the job, to go to the  puppet master, to take the war  to iran itself. >> right. >> you know, i think that the  calculation here is, you take a  huge risk. i mean, we have seen the united  states topple regimes in iraq,  in afghanistan, in libya. those didn't go so well. so i think some tough judgments  are being made here about  whether trying to go after the  nuclear sites and toppling the  iranian regime are worth the  risk. and i'm guessing washington is  engaging israelis in that  conversation. >> and rita, as this all plays  out, perhaps the most  significant headline, and tell  me what you think in the past 24 hours, is from the saudis  talking about $50 oil. if we were already -- if we had  oil anywhere over $100 a barrel  or dealing with supply shortages and what not, this conflict  would be resulting in dramatic  spikes. instead, the opposite seems to  be the case here. >> yeah. i mean, look, there's a couple  of things in terms -- with  regards to iran or israel for  that matter. if there were to be strikes on  iran's oil facilities, iran has  said that it is going to be  targeting potential oil  infrastructure across the gcc  and other countries, as well. which remains a big risk. we have seen that with 2019  attacks, and i think if that  were to happen, prices will go  up. but coming back to the question  of the $50 oil, i do really  firmly believe, given we have  spoken to our sources directly,  that that headline, and the  story, was quite misinformed. there wasn't necessarily a call  that took place last week. look, it doesn't mean that the  thrust of the story is incorrect in the sense that the focus of  saudi arabia and the other  countries that are going ahead  with the voluntary cut is in  compliance. they don't want to be in a  situation where they are cutting production, and there are a few  countries that are not  complying. absolutely that remains the  focus. but i think there's a little  bit -- you know, there's more to that story in terms oh of the  timing<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Why China stocks are not suitable for long-term investment<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> continues. but my next guest says this is  just a short term trade, not a  long-term position, and there  are better places to invest. jared woodard is here. jared, welcome. you won't to go up against  tepper like that? >> i think there's always  opportunities in the market and  our view today is whether it's  monetary easing in the united  states or easier policy in  china, these can be incredibly  powerful in the very short term. but probably aren't the number  one place to commit capital  today. for anyone looking for big  returns on a six or 12-month  time frame or longer. >> i took note, and i'm sure you did, as well, that stanley  drukenmiller remains not excited about thepossibility in chinese stocks. he said until there's a  leadership change with xi  jinping. i'm sure many people share that  view. >> i think it's also the broader economy in china. this stimulus package is, of  course, a positive. but our economist in china, our  strategist at bank of america  and other colleagues, we seem to all have the same view, the  fundamental economic challenges  faced by chinese economy are not resolved by these stimulus  measures. you don't have a robust consumer base, and you're exporting,  that's not been the kind of  recipe for incredible dynamism  for chinese equities. chinese bonds hit an all-time  record low. the government was --  policymakers were stressed out  about this. you can interpret some of this  stimuluses a an effort to divert slows of capital from deflation  toward the stock market, and we  don't have the view that this is the kind of fiscal bazooka that  would give you multiquarter  sustained economic growth beyond the trend level. >> are you in it anywhere for a  trade or are you really on the  sidelines here? >> i appreciate the comments  from dominic earlier. when you have markets that are  liquid or you don't have the  transparency and data,  accounting data, et cetera, that investors in the united states  might be used to, i think it  makes those trades riskier than  they are. there's a lot of ways to benefit if you see sustained economic  growth in china or earnings from their companies in terms of  orders around the world. i think the second derivative  investments whether it's in  australia or latin america,  might be a better way to play  any upside that does happen  without requiring the kind of  challenges that sometimes happen when investors overseas try to  get active in mainland chinese  equities. >> you're looking elsewhere as  well for areas of the markets  that have outpaced the qqqst  this year. they range everything from  national defense stocks to u.s.  renewal plays, nuclear power  fitting in with that. and you're still bullish on  japan. >> that's right. everyone has artificial  intelligence on the brain. but i think it might be  interesting news that all of  those trades you just mentioned, those have been bullish  positions of ours for a while,  have outperformed the growth  stocks this year. post portfolios are weighted  something like 70% toward growth equities. in japan, you've had massive  corporate reform. i was in japan last month, it  was interesting how many  investors think we're only in  the 3rd or 4th inning of the big reforms. you're seeing record buybacks  from japanese companies, and  there's something like 33% of  gdp still locked up in cash in  japan. as those reforms work through, i think you can expect most of the structural upside in those  equities and earnings potential  in that market. >> again, japan was kind of --  preceded china in many of the  measures china is taking to  boost its stock market<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Hurricane Helene hits chip mining town<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> >> including their own systems,  as well. deidre, thank you. we look forward to hearing more  from those executives later on. >>> sticking with the  chipmakers, the whole group  could face a new under the radar risk that could undermine the  industry in six months. megan has the details. >> that's right. so the semiconductor supply  chain is dependent on quarts,  that comes from spruce pine,  north carolina. spruce pine saw two feet of  rainfall from hurricane helene,  and now nearly a week later,  city officials tell me that  there's still no water, power,  or cell service. the infrastructure is completely disrupted to the point that  roads and railways are so torn  up that in some areas in the  western part of the state, mules are being used to transport  materials in and out. so the two companies that  operate the quartz mines there,  they tell us their work has been shut down since thursday, and  quartz corps adds they have no  visibility as to when operations can restart. so the question is not just  whether the mines have been  damaged but also if it's  possible to get the quartz out. it would impact the  semiconductor market that  depends on it. that quartz is used in solar  panels, fiberoptic cables and  ligh lightbulbs, as well. i just spoke with the head of  tech set. their best guess right now is  four to six weeks until things  are back up and running in s<br>s spruce pine, if the roads are  cleared. every day that timeline is e ex extends, that impact multiplies. >> remind me who in the chip  world that uses this quartz, is  it everybody? >> every chainmaker. if you have a cell phone or a  computer, you have a piece of  spruce pine with you. it's the only place in the world that supplies this highly pure  quart that is's used in every  semiconductor that's out there. so it was a vulnerability that  was known before hand, but now  the question is really here. before it was a hypothetical,  now it's a real question of what happen it is they can't get this quartz out. >> sorry, you said it would be  days or weeks at this point? >> they think four to six weeks, but that is depending oh ing on  roads being rebuilt. some places the roads are torn  out of the ground. if they can get those rebuilt  quickly, that should be okay. they do think because the  semiconductor market has seen a  little bit of a slowdown  recently in demand, that there  should be some level of  inventory that's okay. but if it's anything more than  four weeks, i've been told by  experts those ripple effec<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> that to us. >>> that's not the only news out of the tech space. we could say the artificial  intelligence world, nvidia  announced a partnership with  accenture to help clients adopt  their technology. we turn to deidre bosa for more  details in today's "tech check." this is a big deal as well,  deidre. >> yeah, and you know what? these stories are very much  related, because you're seeing  lots of spending to build the  tools and develop ever-more  advanced models. that's what this openai round  was about. but it's taking longer than  expected to materialize into  margin improvement at the  companies buying these tools. that's what this partnership  aims to fix here, partnering  with accenture for the adoption  of ai tools. they're making sure the billions of dollars mega caps are  spending will translate into  hard revenue, while keeping  nvidia relevant every step of  the way. nvidia has cornered the hardware ai market with gpus and moved  into software. now it's making a bigger play  for distribution and enablement. accenturery's army of confull  tanlts will go to customers  across manufacturing, financial  services, et cetera, and help to implement those tools into  everyday operations. in some cases that could mean  that they subscribe to a  co-pilot or agent force and  other cases that could mean  building a custom model with an  openai internally. still unclear, though, how soon  enterprises are going to see  results. there was a very similar  partnership that nvidia  announced one year ago, that was 50,000 employees to be trained  on ai solutions. even the wording nearly  identical. it aimed to "help enterprises  worldwide drive productivity  gains with generative ai." one year on, investors are still looking for those gains. now, nvidia's and julie sweet  will be on later today. that continues to beg the  question, when are we going to  see killer use cases that move  the needle on productivity or  sales of new ai enabled products like the iphone? it's all connected, and raising  the stakes here. but certainly the vc community,  they want to make sure they have a bet on what they think might  be the winner. >> sure, that's their job. in accenture's case, so many  people pointed out the  consultants could be one of the  booming areas that benefits from generative ai is companies try  to figure out what to do with  it, and what competitors are  doing with it. accenture shares, assuming they  might be at an all-time high, to my surprise they peaked in 2022. they were higher in february of  '24 than they are now, and on  the year only up 1%. >> a lot of this is still an  open question, is this army of  consultants going to drive real  productivity gains? a year ago, we haven't seen a  lot of follow through at the  bottom lines. it also raises an interesting  question. i mean, these consulting  companies, the net impact of  generative ai has been flat or  decreasing their workforce. this is making use of 30,000  existing employees, and kind of  using them in a different way,  getting them trained with these  ai tools and consulting. but kelly, look at ibm. they've been largely  consultants. that stock hasn't gone anywhere  fo<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Trade Tracker: Steve Weiss buys Humana<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> let's pull up shares of human a  because this is the worst day i  think in a couple of decades. a drop in the quality ratings  and that was a big threat to  revenues. the stock is down 16%. it was down more than 22%. you bought it, weiss. i bought it on the news. >> a ten-minute trade? >> it's been longer. >> here is my problem. give as much context how long  you think you'll be there. if we're mentioning it on the  program and you say it's for a  trade, which is, respectfully,  you can do whatever you want to  do, i don't want to give people  the impression that this is  something that will be around  for a while. what does that mean? >> if it continues to move up -- so i have a lot lower cost here, the stock goes down over $60  when the news first came out. the news is significant. the ratings are what drives  consumers to the plan. if you have a four-star rating,  consumers will be attracted to. if you have a three star,  they're not as attracted to it. there's also the quality of care measurement, this in particular, they're talking about the star  rating coming down significantly which could affect 50% or more  of earnings in 2027. so right now 2025 is set, 2026  is set. but, here is what to do. they're appealing medicare's  findings. they knew there was something  going on here. here is what would happen, by  october 10th, medicare will come out with their star rating  conclusion. you have some runway to that. right now the stock would be  expensive if these star ratings  hold. they would lose one large  contract. i think you can move up. if it's down $40, i'm gone. >> it's like --  >> conversely. so a trade for 2%, weiss? >> it's dollars. you use the benchmark of the  s&p, inuse the benchmark how  much money am i making. >> here is what we're going to  do, next time we're not even  going to mention it. how about that? >> i didn't lobby anybody --  >> next time we're not even  going to mention it. it's too confusing for the  viewers to figure out when is he in? when is he out? this is the nature.  >> i didn't say i wanted to come and talk about it. i give our viewers credit. i think they can say i gained  the facts, they may think  there's more. i'll worry about 27 when it  happens and they can take  between now and then, i  guarantee a lot of comments will come out for that. >> that's fair. that's fair.<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> OpenAI raises $6.6 billion in latest funding round<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> "the exchange" is right now. welcome to "the exchange." i'm kelly evans. we start this hour with breaking news. it's details on openai's latest  funding round. let's turn to kate rooney in san francisco with the story today. >> reporter: so openai has  officially closed its  multibillion dollar funding  round. it marks one of the largest  private deals we have seen in  silicon valley ever, in history. it's bigger than what we have  seen with a lot of the largest  ipos. the total round of $6.6 billion, this was a $157 million post  money valuation, well above the  $1 $150 billion we had been hearing about. it was led by thrive capital,  also had participation from  khosla ventures, microsoft, as  well. softbank, nvidia, uae backed  fund mgx. you had some others, as well. in the press release today, just now, openai says that this new  cash will help them double down  on leadership and frontier ai  research, increase compute  capacity, and continue building  tools that help people solve  hard problems. the ceo saying in part, ai is  already personalizing learning,  accelerating health care  breakthroughs, and driving  productivity. she says this is just the start. you probably know this name,  openai is the maker of chatgbt. they are also disclosing some  new growth stats in this  release. 250 million weekly user, that  has doubled from a year ago, and grown by 50 million in the past  two months. they've also got a million  chatgbt plus subscribers and a  million chatgbt paying business  users. despite the growth, this company not yet profitable. openai is still on track to lose about $5 billion this year. that would be on $3.7 billion of revenue. no updates on the company  converting to a for-profit yet,  but i'm told that is very much  in the works. this is now one of the most  valuable companies in the  valley, and in the world really, just behind spacex, which has  been around for two decades. at this point, the openai round  highlights some of the endless  demand to get part of this ai  company. tomorrow, we'll sit down with  the fco at the 10:00 a.m. hour. >> this is massive, considering  the company is going to lose $5  billion this year, on $3.7  billion of revenue. so normally we see, okay,  there's a path to profitability. but in this case, if they can't  figure out a way of running more efficiently, and these chips are so costly, i'm curious what  investors are so excited about? >> reporter: they are whistling  past the losses. you hear from sources, those  losses are sort of controllable, that they are allowing  themselves to lose that amount  of money because they need to  spend and compete in the  long-term strategic bet here is  that this is going to be a  short-term loss, and in the long run, they have to sprint to  spend. that's going to mean losses, but they're hoping that this is  really the winner in ai. so a lot of competition this  round, we talked to investors  who did not get into this round. it's one of the most competitive private funding rounds we have  seen here. i would note softbank getting in here, so that marks one of their<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Calls of the Day: MercadoLibre, Rio Tinto, Apollo, Berkshire, Carrier and Trade Desk<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> welcome back calls of the day marcado bbre downgraded today to neutral from overweight jp morgan time to take a breather they suggest limited room for consensus upside they do keep the price target $2400 joe all right so let's set the expectation for the viewers on this position first of all in the jot etf it's been a holding since april of 23 i cite that because we have a 54% gain so we have time on our side we could be patient going through what a period looks like where margins are going to compress they're going to compress because they're spending building out distribution centers spending on logistics the credit card business is seeing some challenges as well so you're going to have a period where this might be a pause that will ultimately refresh i like the e-commerce theme this is a104 billion market cap company it joins amazon and coupang in our ownership of ecommerce be patient write out what potentially is a margin contraction period rio tinto jenny got upgraded to buy at barenburg what an economic moat really looks like is the commentary from their thing um price target goes to 79 71 so with rio it's really all about the iron ore and right now they're producing they're selling it at 109 a ton that's down from the 144 in january but when they talk about that moat that's because it costs them $22 a ton to produce so it's extraordinary they have almost no debt which puts them in a great position to make acquisitions and here here are the um valuations which which are pretty insane trading at 10 times earnings five times ebitda has a 6.1% dividend yield has a 7% free cash flow yield so we own this in our international income strategy and we love owning it in there because it's a way to play china without also without actually need to own chinese stocks this is just a quick aside but there was a headline from goldman this morning that said hedge funds made record purchases of china shares and to us when we hear that it's hot money flooding into the china chinese shares not you know not real investment into those companies so for us playing rio is a nice way to actually participate in the growth of china without getting caught up in chinese stock shares apollo price target raised to 142 reiterated by bank of america joe the alternative asset manages right now are seeing very strong tailwinds in the case of apollo you're talking about a company that's raising nearly $150 billion through 2029 in this space we have ownership of four names that are performing very well obviously we own apollo in addition we own kkr arch capital and brown and ground you could also look towards evercore which is up 47% year to date surprisingly blackstone is struggling and i'll throw out another name which is blue owl capital trading at around $19 doing well and congratulations to the co-owners of blue owl who just closed on the tampa bay lightning yesterday $1.8 billion okay uh burkshire price target 512 uh from 488 by cfra you want to take that one listen berk is so good at finding quality and value in the market i would imagine that they were first in identifying opportunities in japan we've seen re recent weakness in japan they'll take advantage of that as well then in the energy space we just learned a utility um that was previously held at 92% by burkshire they just bought the remaining 8% burkshire energy did uh the estate of walter scott that's where they got the other 8% so they're just able to realize value in in all environments where there seems to be weakness price weakness carrier global deutsche says catalyst cell call what do you think jenny so this that's our short-term rating the target is 70 bucks $10 below where it is now yeah so this is a really tough one for us we bought this in 2021 we paid $37 a share for it and it was trading at 17 times fast forward now it's at 27 times and we actually trimmed it about 2 weeks ago now on the um on the 20th we trimmed it when it was about 80 and a half we took it from about a 5% position back down to a 3% position for exactly these reasons that it just moved up too fast management spoke at a conference and there was so much enthusiasm that the stock took another leg up so here we sit and we're like this is a great company there's huge wind at the back in terms of um the world broadly using more air conditioning in the us people wanting more and more efficient air conditioning system so there's huge growth but the valuation a stretch so we're kind of on the fence with our 3% remaining position and don't disagree with the cell rating all right the trade desk uh some optimism here joe from truest and dan ies truest goes to 120 uh ies goes 115 they're both obviously constructive on this name and i think you own this absolutely and they should be constructive on this name this is coming up on now two years that we've had this holding based on the momentum factor more than anything else in the etf so momentum is not just cyclical jenny it's secular as well i'm very surprised that this company has not been added to the s&p 500 that was the expectation it grows its revenue at 25% over the last 3 years on a consistent quarterly basis and has a very strong share of the digital ad market using ai$ 53 billion market cap i wouldn't be surprised if someone buys this company at some point<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Deutsche Bank's Deepak Puri expects a modest 'relief rally' following the election<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> bond market is still sensitive  to any signs that you actually  have some down tturn moves. i think it needs confirmation  all along the way and  reinforcement. >> mike, appreciate it. that's where we'll start this  morning. deepak is here at post nine. great to have you back, key pac. >> thank you, carl. >> what do you make of this  notion that you've got to do a  little work, but the end of the  year will be a gift? >> well, with you know, markets, collectively is also an exercise in expectations. and i think the expectations are so high that "a," the u.s. will  never have a recession. "b," you know, somehow wars are  good for risk. you know, i can gone and on. the u.s. home buyers. but i do feel that short-term,  and i would like to quote fed  chair goolsbee here from  chicago. he said, if you look at both  sides of the fed's mandate, you  would love to freeze them both  right now. because given the last six  months of inflation trajectory,  you know, it's around 2%, the  you were to analyze it, the  unemployment number of 4.2%,  pretty much for stable  employment. so you would love to freeze both sides. the problem is, as we know,  markets are not going to stay  like this for the foreseeable  future. yes, for the time being, i think there's a lot of positives. you know, from a seasonality  perspective, notwithstanding  october could be a little bit  challenging. but you do expect, you know --  we do expect a little bit of  relief rally post the election. what i would say, you know, and  i think mike used the term, a  tactical pause. i think it's really good to be  patient right now. there are just too many moving  parts to the markets, be it the  strike, be it the reconstruction post pos po pos post-helane, what happened in  the middle east. >> deutsche today, i think it  was reed posted a chart looking  at the wave of monetary easing  that's coming all around the  globe, in the coming meetings. and he poses an argument that  maybe september is the month  where we move from a gradual  easing cycle to one that's a  little more aggressive. >> we've seen almost 21 central  banks cut rates. you have to go back to the dark  days of the pandemic to see the  central banks cutting rates. that is a net positive. what is concerning is we are  still assuming that the soft  landing is sort of a done deal. and i think a lot hinges on that particular paradigm. if you want to get much more  severe in the economy, then i  think you start looking at  things a bit differently. maybe the fed would then have to be a bit more aggressive in  terms of how quickly they get to the neutral. and also, the fact that  inflation can fair up to my  earlier comments. global supply chain issues, that could have an impact. >> you mentioned the port as one of the risks. do you think market is trading  off of that? is it a risk? is it the longer it goes on, we  start to see an impact? how do you work with that as an  investor? >> it's difficult to work with  that. it's just, an assessment goes  anywhere from $2 billion to $4  billion per day, off of activity having some sort of not getting  into the market, because of the  port strike. now, if you were to make it a  month-long strike, i think  that's when the market starts to feel a reason to respond. otherwise, i think it might not  be a very important  market-moving event. but when you add that other  things that are happening, i  think collectively, that all can have an impact on the police  station number. and that's something we need to  as investors watch. and it could be that the data,  incoming data for the next  couple of months could be quite  noisy. >> that's what i was wondering. you said we can't freeze the  dual mandate statistics. so is there a bigger risk on the jobs front or the inflation  front at this point? >> i think until last week, i  think it was on the jobs front. what we are seeing today, you  can see that the risk is  starting to shift a bit more on  the inflation front, as well. and i think hence, the fed needs to really have this thin margin  of error to be able to, you  know, do what they're trying to  do, which is get to a soft  landing. >> if the risk is that inflation is higher then they want and we  expect, that they won't be able  to do as much on the jobs side. >> i think it's both to be --  but i do believe that the bigger risk is definitely on the labor  market front. see, if you look at the private  asset purchasing, right,  consumption is not slowing. it's just shifting. and the key here is that can the fed orchestrate the interest  rate-sensitive parts of the  markets to pick up while the  consumption is somewhat slowing  down or shifting. so the home, the housing, the  manufacturing, those things need to pick up the slack from  consumption. and hence, i think it becomes  important from what we are  discussing, whether as of today, that private domestic  consumption is growing at a 2.5% clip, which is nothing to be bad about. >> some argue three. >> somebody yesterday used the  butter knife to do open heart  surgery metaphor when it comes  to the fed. do you think they can get away  an ecb-like pause, where they  cut, then they don't, then maybe they cut again, but they don't? is there -- does the narrative  need to be more thematically  pure, for credibility to be  sustained? >> i think the latter. >> really? >> i think they do need -- they  started this easing cycle with a little bit of an extra  aggressiveness, with a 50 basis  point rate cut. depending what happens on  friday, with a non-farm labor,  and they have another one for  the october month, right before  the fed meeting, i think those  two data appoints woul<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> let's turn to standard arrow today making its market debut here at the nysc the third largest ipo of the year so far the company specializes in aftermarket aircraft engine services raises 1.4 billion by offering 60 million at 24 now indicated above the range between 29 and 31 we'll see how this opens joining us here at post 9 is standard arrow ceo russell ford russell congratulations good to have you in thank you very much really a pleasure to be here uh talk about the journey and sort of the business mix you do commercial military some business aviation is how does that how does the mix work yeah uh thank you we we've been around a long time 113 years so uh we perform a necessary piece of the operating infrastructure for the entire aerospace industry not just commercial we provide highly regulated highly technical maintenance on the most critical part of an aircraft which is the engine and we do that for engines that operate for a large trunk airlines around the world as well as for governments for military operations as well as for uh business aviation for big fractional operators you work with a bunch of oems they sort of spread out i guess you don't rely on one more than the other right no we're very careful to make sure that we don't have any concentration issues but uh there there are five major engine oes in on the planet that can design develop certify jet engine and we work with all five of those so that's the the gea aviation rollsroyce honeywell pratt and whitney now part of ron and saffron i'm curious about the valuation because it looks like you're going to be valued north of $8 billion this is the carile exit we should mention but still adjusted eid of $561 million so how does how does the math work well uh i think because the work that we do as i mentioned is uh is highly regulated there's a lot of intellectual property involved in the operation for maintenance for an aircraft engine and that provides a very significant level of protection around that type of work very few companies in the world have the access to the intellectual property the technical specs have the industry trade secret information for developing custom maintenance solutions and have the engineering capability and authorization to be able to do that so it so is it cost is that why still operating at a net loss well no we're we're actually profitable now okay got it okay i'm looking at 2022 net loss but clearly i mean it's a costly business right the uh it the industry uh has continued to grow uh demand for aircraft travel continues to increase uh and as a result aircraft engines typically live a very long time they'll live 30 or 40 years so there is a very durable very stable revenue stream for maintenance and that gives uh a lot of risk reduction when you think about how we can look forward we have high visibility for the revenue incoming revenue stream and that allows us to optimize the business in terms of how we deploy our capital and our resources i think a lot of viewers probably have a sense of how efficient the engines have become over the last few decades but we keep hearing about new chapters of propulsion right that will that'll bring us into a new age really when it comes to the the basics of an engine how far away is that and what would that do to your business model yeah actually we are uh actively participating in next generation engine programs so we are actively working with for instance boom supersonic who's developing the replacement for the concord it has a entirely new engine design we will be producing the initial engines for them and their development we're working with several other companies that are developing uh propulsion prototypes that are electric propulsion hydrogen fuel propulsion so we're on the leading edge of that helping them design those aircraft engines for maintainability the cost of ownership of an aircraft engine over 40 years you know that revenue stream cost of ownership becomes very important over that lifespan<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Fmr. US Secretary of Defense: A broader Middle East war could tip global economies into recession<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> >> he says there's ip ready. >> what's on the cutting room  floor, basically, take it out. that's going to be one to watch  over the coming weeks, let's  turn to geopolitics, following  iran's assault on israel  yesterday morning, confrontation continues to escalate today. israel vowing iran will pay for  the missile attack. here with us now on the latest  is william cohen, u.s. former  defense secretary under clinton, ceo of the cohen group. what do you think that will look like, mr. secretary, in terms of israel threatening, iran will  pay. >> i think the israelis will  move fairly quickly, delay will  not work in their favor. i would expect if they have the  entire spectrum of capability,  that they can call upon from  cyber technology, kinetic, also  sanctions, but my expectation is they will hit fixed targets,  probably missile silos and  sites, production of weapons  facilities, and quite possibly,  in my opinion, quite probably,  they will go after some of the  nuclear production capability  that iranians are trying to  develop. i think it's across the  spectrum. i think they will hit pretty  hard. the biden administration will  urge some caution. i think that prime minister  netanyahu will say this is our  opportunity, iran has been  hanging over us for 75 years,  and we're going to take action  now to reduce their capability. >> why wouldn't that go after  the nuclear facility. they're in an existential war,  and this represents potentially  the biggest existential threat,  and all we hear is that iran is  going closer and closer, weeks  away. >> well, they can, and i think  probably will go after their  nuclear facilities, but i'm not  sure they have the capability to do it on their own. they don't have the capability  the united states has. the question is, will the united states join them in this effort? and what does that mean for the  united states? what does that mean for  president biden trying to bring  act some kind of a peaceful  solution to the region. i think also, there are  unintended consequences to that. if you have a regional war, what does that do in terms of our  economy, the world economy? we're already seeing a spike of  oil. the price of oil, it's bound to  go up. off strike on the east coast, as far as the shipping is  concerned. and plus, you got the disaster  in helene throughout our eastern coast. there's a lot going on. i think biden will still try to  urge some caution here. we're with you up to a point  where you're with us to start  taking out nuclear sites. we may have a problem with that. that's a discussion that's  probably taking place right now. >> if given to choice, which do  you think they would rather it,  nuclear production or oil  refi refinement? >> i think nuclear production. that's the one thing they fear. the oil production can be hit at any time. going after the nuclear  facilities at this particular  point in time, you have the u.s. in the region with a capable  submarine on site, capable of  launching what they call a sea  launch group missiles. you have also aircraft that we  have in the region that can  level a devastating attack. i think that the israelis are  saying, are you with us, are you not? if you're not, are we willing to take this move on our own. i think they will -- the biden  administration will be careful  here. they don't want to try to appear to put a horse collar around  prime minister netanyahu or  aren't the vice president. so i think the biden  administration will be trying to calibrate working with the  israelis, saying we're with you, here's what we think you should  do. here are the consequences if you go beyond that. and after we all have to be  willing to live with that. >> well, we've heard from the  biden administration, there's  been a lot of cease-fire,  de-escalation, which it doesn't  appear to be working, or what's  panning out or necessarily what  israel needs. >> well, it leaves the region in a constant state of uncertainty. you have many of the gulf states are supporting israel in terms  of going after iran. they worry about iran getting a  nuclear weapon. iran is a theocratic state and a revolutionary state, who want to be the dominant force throughout the region. the gulf state certainly doesn't want that. israel doesn't want that, nor  should the united states want  that. so it's trying to calibrate it  into how to becoming a regional  were, which will have <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Barclays' Tim Long: We anticipate soft demand for iPhone 16<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> apple shares this week. a number of analysts, including  our next guest, warning of  softening demand for the iphone  16. he believes apple has cut about  3 million units for the december quarter, the earliest build cut  in recent history. tim long joins us now, has an  underweight rating. price target $186. the part of your report  yesterday that seemed to concern people, you cited supply chain  channel checks and 3 million  units being cut at a  semiconductor component in  iphones. how confident are you that that  is true, a, and, b, that it will have the impact you think it  means on demand? >> sure. thanks for having me. yeah, look, we do think, we're  pretty confident that there have been some adjustments to the  build plan. if you remember correctly, a few weeks after their june event,  there was a lot of speculation  that apple was telling the  supply chain to build more  iphones for this upcoming cycle, given all of the data that we've seen and others have talked  about with preorders being weak, it's likely that upside that  they were hoping for in these  devices is not there currently. we're still only a few weeks  into the cycle, so certainly  things can change. but we do think this upside case that was built in has probably  gone away, for now, and we'll  just have to track to see how  sell through or true demand is  tracking over the next month or  two. most indications are we're  tracking about 10% down, if not  even a little bit more, compared to the iphone 15 cycle. so it is off to a little bit of  a weak start here. >> yeah, i mean, you say in the  report yesterday, yourself, 15%  declines year-over-year for  iphone 16 in the first week of  sales. doing some reporting here, so to speak. does this mean this thing is  going to be -- i don't know,  would you term it a weaker  expectation overall for the  entry of the new iphone than  we've seen in some time? >> yeah, it certainly feels that way, particularly because the  iphone 14 and iphone 15 cycles  were basically flat. so we're coming into this with  an iphone-installed base that's  very old. on average, people are holding  phones that are five, five and a half years old. so the setup was pretty good  into the cycle. the apple intelligence features  are not out yet, so there is a  possibility that when we start  to see apple intelligence on  these phones, at some point in  october or maybe november when  the betas are completed, there  might be more demand. there could certainly be a lot  more promotion and co-marketing, maybe with some of the u.s.  carriers, maybe some more  discounting. so it's a little bit different  cycle this time around, because  we do have a meaningful software feature, for the last decade or  so, most of the features that  have been added each year are  some kind of a hardware-based  feature and those haven't really resulted in much change. we're shipping this year the  same number of iphone units we  shipped about ten years ago on  the 6 and 6+. so apple has not really had that killer product in almost a  decade. will apple intelligence and  these ai features change that  dynamic? it still remains to be seen. i think consumersreally need to get the services in their hand  to try them out and see if it's  something that's worthy of  considering an upgrade for their current device. >> how much of the stock move  and the conviction on the stock  story has to do with just the  sales of this product, the 16,  and apple intelligence versus  some of the other bigger picture reasons to own the stock  services and everything else  they've got going on? >> sure, there's a lot of  dynamics within apple, of  course. i'm a tech hardware analyst and  i've covered this space for 25  plus years. this stock has morphed into  being looked at in a lot of  different ways, but for us,  yeah, this iphone is important  because there is some ai premium built in, like happens with a  lot of technology stocks. so if they can't prove that ai  will drive the cycle that will  be meaningful, there's still a  lot of regulatory risk, that is  something investors are  watching. we should get the initial ruling on the google doj case, which  impacts a large part of apple's  earnings through the tech  payment they get. that's a meaningful driver as  well. so there are several vectors  here. we think this iphone is very well. so, there are several vectors  here. we think this iphone is very  important coming off two weak  cycles with what is -- some were expecting to be a super cycle. we don't really expect super  cycles, that's pretty rare in  smartphone land. that's why i think it's extra  important. there is still a lot of  regulatory, china exposure. there's other things that are  getting a lot of attention, as  well. >> right, right. finally, if you're right and  this thing is down 15%, let's  call it, year over year, where's the stock go? >> well, we're using a  25-multiple on the stock. it's currently trading at 30  times. so, you know, we're in the  mid-180s for our price target. you know, there's a lot of  different constituents owning  this stock t<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Lean into growth and cyclicals to manage potentially choppy end of year, says Citi's Scott Chronert<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> explainer to a tough story to  comprehend. thank you. bertha coombs watching the story out of humana.  >>> our next guest does prefer  growth and cyclical names to  manage choppiness going into  year end. citi's u.s. equity strategist,  s&p target of 5600. scott, great to have you back. since we last talked, we got  china stimulus, a couple of  strikes in the middle east. does any of that change your  overall playbook? >> the middle east is an ongoing wild card. geopolitics is something we keep an eye on. trying to translate it into  fundamentals has been trickier,  going back to russia, ukraine,  and now the ongoing israeli  situation. so we're keeping an eye on that. what we did do tactically was go overweight energy going into q4, so this was over the weekend. we think the setup allows for  some potential beneficiary of  that continuing to flare up. but i would say it's a  contrarian call right now.  >> does that move in on your  monetary policy forecast? >> well, essentially the way  this goes in terms of the  monetary policy setup is that we still think we're in this less  restrictive mode, we're not to  the point yet where we can say,  hey, the fed is at this point,  being accommodative. so what we're looking to do is  balance here in terms of growth, to be defensive as a play into  the end of the year. we wanted to marry it with  cyclicles and we've gone  overweight financials. so essentially what we're doing  here is avoiding the more  defensive parts of the market,  which in our view are generally  historically expensive. health care, a little bit of an  outlier. we've been underweight for the  better part of the year. we don't see any urgency to go  back to those sectors. we prefer to either go down the  growth path or begin to kind of  set up for the other side of  this hawkish fed narrative.  >> so the fed has to stick the  soft landing for that to work? >> i think the bet is that the  fed trajectory from here  continues lower, the market is  telling you we're prepared for  as much as 200 basis points. >> the market has been wrong on  that before.  >> the market has been wrong on  that. but i do think that the setup  here, in our view, is one where  fundamentally, we think we're  still looking at a pretty good  q3 reporting earnings season. we did go underweight  industrials and the spin is  clear, relative performance has  been pretty good, valuations  have gotten pretty expensive. we think there's going to be  fraying around the edges from  the fundamental perspective as  we go through q3 reporting. >> is it a bigger risk that the  fed doesn't cut as much or that  the economy performs worse than  expected? >> okay, so from our  perspective, the bigger risk is  that the fed needs to stay ahead of the narrative here, and we  don't want to fall too far  behind. if you do begin to see some  further deterioration in the  labor circumstance, which is  essentially a house economics  call, we will see a downward  spiral or deceleration in labor. i don't think that necessarily  means --  >> that just means they're going to be cutting more. isn't it a bigger risk that we  have reflation because commodity prices are rising again on  geopolitics? >> i argue that is more of a '25 risk but a little bit different. we're talking about the election in nearly every conversation,  and our view is that both  candidates are mostly  fundamentally negative for u.s.  equities. but we have that lingering  deficit discussion around  spending in the background. so when i look at the rate  environment, i think the fed is  on a path where they can  continue to ease, andi think  that's net-net constructive  versus the past two-year  narrative. but as you getfurther into 2025 and we continue to go down this  debate around how to finance the deficit, then you begin to risk  things like the bond market, the vigilantes coming back, where  it's less tied to the  traditional economic  circumstances.  >> what's your number for  friday? >> well, i don't have a number  specifically on that. but what i would say is that i  think we're prepared, in  position that it's going<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> multi-million dollar bet to keep up with the growing demand for  its weight loss drugs. our angelica peebles is live in  indianapolis with more. good morning, angelica. >> good morning, carl. that's right, we are here in  indy at one of lilly's research  lapse. this is the place where zeptide  was made. this is a really important area  for the company, of course. they have a lot more in  development. we sat down with ceo dave ricks  yesterday about what's next,  here's what he had to say. >> currently, lilly has 11  pipeline projects in obesity. all with sort of different modes of action or different modes of  delivery. oral is a big need, of course. multi-modal, so it's different  than other glp-1s. we have dual acting and  triple-acting drugs with  multiple mechanisms to have more potent effects. >> now, a big piece of this  investment in going forward for  lilly is figure out how to make  these medicines. they're really complex, and  that's why the company today is  saying that it will spend $4.5  billion to open gnaw center  about 40 miles northwest of  here, that will focus on r&d  manufacturing. that new facility will do some of what's happening here at a  bigger scale, particularly to  supply the clinical trials. back you guys. >> because, angelica, there's  still a big supply demand  mismatch on these medications,  isn't there? >> there's still a supply  mismatch. we'll see that going forward. about what's happening here, the scientists knew that creating  peptides the traditional way,  which takes too long, they went  ahead and developed a faster way that was more efficient to do  it. that's why the company said,  this is something that we want  to do with other medicines, and  that's what you're seeing with  this investment today. >> and you don't know what that  is next, exactly what it is,  angelica? >> reporter: we tried to ask a  few times. we asked about specific drugs  and they wouldn't te<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Oil slightly higher on Middle East tensions<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> rates. now it feels like a 25 basis  point cut. but let's see what happens  friday.  >> the price was the low of the  year. meantime, energy to watch. oil prices are higher, once  again, after israel did strike  back at hezbollah in lebanon. the real story may be why oil is not even higher, given some of  these rising tensions. let's check in with brian  sullivan. and this morning's headlines  regarding opec and the saudis.  >> or maybe why oil is not  actually lower, you know, that  "wall street journal" article  we'll get to in a second. i have a fax coming in. unbelievable. yes, they still exist. here is the thing. let's talk first about why oil  prices are not higher. i think it's pretty obvious,  they're up 3% to $72. that's pretty obvious. why aren't they at 80 bucks  given all the tensions we are  seeing in the middle east? let's talk about it. number one, you've got a couple  million spare barrels of  capacity that the saudis are  sitting on, basically opec could release if we see a description  to iran. u.s. oil production, as you've  noted many times, is at record  high, 13.2 million barrels a day as well. and the most important thing is  we have not seen a major  reaction from israel. yes, they attacked hezbollah  sites in beruit, lebanon,  overnight, but we have not seen  a big response by israel  directly at iran, either at  their oil ports or the nuclear  facilities. those would be the things, guys, that we all know that wouldsend oil much, much higher. now, to the little palace  intrigue story, carl, that you  sort of referenced. big article in the "wall street  journal" today, opec just ended  their virtual meeting today, no  change in output, none was  expected. they said russia and iraq are  now conforming. here is the story. is opec sort of on the inside  fracturing? the "wall street journal" story  noted that there was a  conference call recently, like  last week or whenever it might  have been, and that there was  some concerns about the saudi  price target, which there is no  price target, by the way. but will they defend the price  or did it devolve into a market  share war and send oil down to  maybe 50 bucks a barrel? saudi has reached out directly  to me and said -- they didn't  say the story was wrong, but  they said there was no  conference call recently. so it appears saudi is pushing  back on the "wall street  journal" story, but i think your point, carl, is well taken. this $50 thing getting a lot of  attention this morning. i guess i'll go check my fax  machine and see what rolled in.  >> who has a fax machine? >> i know, that's really kind of bizarre. what is it, 1992 in the sullivan household? >> listen, i'm glad that i could make the hit more interesting,  no matter what it was.  >> you always make them  interesting. come back to us. you know the saudis as well as  anyone, brian. so how do you view this in terms of the communication you've  gotten, the fact they're  questioning the journal story? where do you think the truth  really lies here? >> somebody is talking. listen, opec is a big group,  opec+ an even bigger group. i think it seems clear that  there are likely members inside  of opec that are sort of talking to various parts of the media,  maybe myself included, who  knows, and basically saying here is what we think is going to  happen. this is a group, they are  aligned in many ways, but they  are also sovereign nations, as  you know, looking out for their  own sovereign nation best  interest. how do we read this? i think we read this as -- and i want to clear up something that  has been wrong in certain parts  of the media for a couple weeks  now. there is no saudi arabian or  opec price target. there is no official opec or  saudi price target. i want to clear that up. there's been a lot of talk about defending higher prices, but i  think this is a clear sign that  some in the group maybe are not  happy with their quotas, that  they are sort of being allowed,  i'm using air quotes, to pump  out. so says my fax, anyway<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> china is making so many that the demand for gasoline is going to  plummet.  >> we're going to watch. that speaking of energy,  transportation, the number we've been waiting for all week is  tesla deliveries. we might have it. let's get to phil lebeau.  >> we do have it, carl. sometimes the numbers are pretty darn close to the estimates. tesla delivering over 42,000. we're not going to see a whole  lot of reaction to tesla's  shares today. this is the first time since the fourth quarter that tesla posted a gain, a positive  year-over-year gain or an  increase, i should say, in  sales. last year they were roughly in  line with where they were in  terms of total deliveries. this is the number people were  expected. 462,890, producing 870,000  vehicles. and we'll have the date when  tesla will report its q3  numbers, which is on the 23rd  after the bell. just a smidge, just a smidge  more than the street was  expecting. guys, i'll send it back to you.  >> hey, phil, i'm going to bring you into the conversation we  were just having. jim was bringing up the idea, at what point does the increasing  number of evs start to affect  the praise of gasoline? i don't know, we're still at  very low percentages, aren't we? >> we're not there, david.  >> yeah.  >> worldwide, i mean, you  definitely are seeing the growth in china certainly impacting the demand for ice vehicles. but we're not seeing it  definitely in terms of the  united states. in terms of vehicles sold, it's  going to be about 9% relative to the rest of the market. ice is still 79, 80%. you're seeing a slow erosion in  the ice market but definitely  not to the point where you're  telling people, look, you don't  need to buy an ice vehicle and,  therefore, gasoline demand is  dropping.  >> well, phil, this is jim. is this the last thing that  happens before we start talking  about autonomous and the big  day? i've got to tell you, phil, the  expectations, we don't have a  lot of things out there that i  hear people are so excited about other than this day. it's really rather amazing.  >> absolutely. >> it's the thing everyone is  focused on. we've heard we're going to have  these vehicles and drive them  all over the road. what we want to hear next week  from elon musk next week is, a,  first of all, what the vehicles  will look like. we've heard some things being  leaked out about the possibility that it will be more of a  different design, more of a  mi microcar. they're not going to be  widespread. how much clarity does he give us in terms of the growth that he  expected? does he tell us, look, in the  meantime we're going to be  focused delivering a lower  priced vehicle to the market? there is no doubt when you look  at the demand for the model 3 or the model y, the reason those  are so strong, so successful is  because of the pricing that they come in at. that's where the market for evs  is headed, lower priced  vehicles. if he comes out and says, look,  we're going to come out with  something even lower priced and  give us some clarity there, i  wouldn't be surprised to see the shares move higher. but the focus on the robo cars,  that's what people are focused  on.  >> the cyber truck, was that a  big waste of time? >> they're actually rolling out  the numbers.  >> numbers are good. numbers are good. phil's right. numbers are good for the cyber.  >> they're not huge, david. are they as big as the model 3  and the model y? no. but they are growing production  and growing deliveries. look, you see them more and more when you're driving around. i see them where there's heavy e ve adoption. in areas where you don't expect  to see them, you're starting to  see them a little more. i wouldn't call them a failure. did they zig while others  zagged? absolutely. that's why elon musk did a 180  in the first quarter and said,  we've got to come out with a  lower priced vehicle, and that's what they're going to be  expected to announce at the q3  results for next week.  >> to go back on the cyber  truck, they did surpass the  mach-e mustang sales.  >> yeah. it was never going to be as <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Sen. Tim Scott: Economically you were healthier under Donald Trump than you are under Joe Biden<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> generals j.d. vance and tim  walz. the two men got substantive on  issues from taxes to energy. joining us now with his thoughts on the debate, republican  senator tim scott from south  carolina, ranking member on the  senate banking committee, and  was a candidate for president  himself this cycle and also  mentioned as a possible vice  presidential candidate. that whole narrative always  bothers me, because i don't  equate corporations with rich -- those are the -- the elites and  the rich people. i think a corporate tax cut made sense. it helped. a reason factories are built  here but i want to grill you on  something else.  >> yes. i want to answer that question,  too, joe.  >> you can. steve liesman just said, didn't  say it this way. i ap. last night. any free trader here still  around in the united states? >> absolutely. i'm one of them. no question about it. listen, the free traders are a  part of the republican party. more importantly we've seen the  expansion of the republican  tent. we saw last night j.d. vance  had --  >> for texas? >> j.d. vance had a dominant  performance. what he talked about was the  fact that there is an, a  forgotten voter in ohio, and  pennsylvania and michigan, and  he spoke specifically to them. one of the most important parts  of being a good communicator  knowing who your audience is and he struck the right cord for the audience that we as republicans  need to continue top attract to  our party the big tent party so  we have four more years of  donald trump and i thought j.d.  was fantastic and the coach  fumbled the ball early on in the game.  >> how so? some sought j.d. did well others thought walz did well? >> i'm not sure what you  listened to saying walz did  well. coach walz fumbled the ball from the beginning. nervous. focused on notes more than  audience. j.d. was clear,en consistent. coach --  >> ask you about free trade,  please? can i just do that ? a big tent, saying that. what does that mean.  >> people better off four years  ago want to be better off the  next four years. you can look at the granular  aspects of policy. they're very important. an example, walz said last night because of tax cuts we had $8  trillion additional debt. hogwash. more money came into the its landed a ton of debt on our  backs. walz talked about this big  government approach. jd vance said we're going to  believe in the american people. he talked about the jtaj. for the single mom making  $40,000 a year in '17, we cut  her taxes by 70%. that's the kind of performance  you want. if you're focusing on people  working paycheck to paycheck.  >> do you agree with all the  tariffs? do you agree with 200%? do you think people who make  stuff here should be a 15% tax? that's an industrial policy,  isn't it? >> i believe oftentimes donald  trump talks in the abstract,  number one. number two --  >> what are we to believe them? >> believe is performance. believe what we saw between 2017 and 2020. let me finish because you asked  me a question. what should we believe? we should believe that a --  reducing the taxes from 35% to  20% repatriated $2 trillion  around the home. we should believe that 7 million jobs he created and two-thirds  were african americans,  hispanics, and women.  >> obviously that excludes  covid, right? part of what you're saying is we should sort of take this  time-out period around covid and not include that.  >> not at all. i would actually say if you look at covid itself specifically,  they said that you couldn't get  a vaccine in ten years or five  years.  >> the reason i'm raising this  is because when we try to do an  apples to apples between the  trump administration and the  biden administration, invariably what we hear is look at all of  the economic growth during the  trump administration, but, by  the way, please don't look at  the last year, and then look at  how terrible we say the biden  administration did on a relative basis, but, by the way, please  don't even contemplate the idea  that anything happened before  that as it relates to covid.  >> let us ask the american  people are they better off now  than they were four years ago? the answer is emphatically no.  >> because we were writing  checks with donald trump's name  on them.  >> lost spending power? of course you're not better off. when gas is up 50% more --  >> why do you think that was? >> obviously there's two  reasons. the average american family has  less spending power today than  they did beforehand. the first vote the democrats  took in january of 2021 -- let  me finish my comment, thanks so  much. $1.9 trillion of additional  spending from the federal  government that --  >> coming out of it.  >> and accelerated inflation. inflation hits 9% in june/july  of 2021, leading to the crushing effect of high inflation that we haven't seen since the jimmy  carter years on the average  person working paycheck to  paycheck.  >> we saw around the globe as it relates to inflation, if that is -- if you're going to put --  >> so do you disagree -- here's  how you do it. go from $1.9 trillion from an  infrastructure bill that was  $2.2 trillion and an act that  was $800 billion. you add it all together. it always causes a crisis in the u.s. economy.  >> and the u.s. economy  continued to grow and had less  inflation than just about  everyone else in the world. how do you explain that? >> simply we went into covid on  a positive note. this is easy to explain to the  average person. the explanation is a the  healthier one. economically you were healthier  under donald trump. number two, we had, frankly,  respect around the world, and  number three, the greatest  invasion across our southern  border has happened under kamala harris's watch. the border czar barely made it  to the border, and now that  she's blind, she's now rushing <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Lazard CEO Peter Orszag on the economy, impact of port strike and Middle East conflict, state of M&A<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> dealmaking the fed and what he's learned in first year of head of his firm, peter orszag, ceo of  lazar and former officer of  budget under president obama. good morning. i want to talk all you've  learned in last year but start  with maybe what you've learned  or are thinking about in the  last 24 to 48 hours as we think  about potential escalation in  the middle east and maybe some  of the jobs numbers and how all  overlays together on the global  economy and other economy here  at home? >> look, i think what we learned from the pandemic is, you really need to focus on the supply side of the economy. that is the explanation for, the primary explanation for why  inflation went up and why it  went down. the two rinks you've talked  about this morning are  important. the port strike and what's  happening in the middle east. so i think it is worthy of the  attention you're giving it. >> and, therefore, what do you  think the true implication is  over the next several weeks, and should we be focused more on the port strike? would you focus more on  potential escalation in iran? and israel? >> look, a lot of this depends  on, for example, with the port  strike, how long it goes on. so it's difficult to predict its aggregate impact. ruffles on a thumb on the at  least, every $10 on the price of oil is something like 20 basis  po points on inflation and 10 basis points on gdp. a sense what we're talking  about. not catastrophic numbers but <br>g significant.  >> when you think about this,  therefore, and lay the election  on top of this? >> we're living in a world in  which, as i've been saying for a while now, you can't make  business decisions without  taking geopolitical  considerations into account, and i think the last 24 to 48 hours  underscores that. so we do have everything that  we've been talking about  affecting feeding back on to the business environment. now, it's important to note  that's in the context of a  pretty strong economy. inflation coming down. the labor market holding up, and ceos and others seeing through  some of the short-term  uncertainty to the underlying  drivers of activity including  ongoing technology, et cetera.  >> are you of the view? talking about the fed, what they may or may not do, in terms of  lowering rates and do they lower rates even more if we have a  true supply chain shock, and  actually would lower rates,  would it help the problem or the issue, if, in fact, we know what the problem is, which is the  supply chain? >> so, the fundamental problem  for monetary policy is that  almost all of the discussion is  always framed around demand  shocks, and that's where the  classic, you know what do you do when x happens kicks in? the fed, any central bank is  worse off in the face of an  adverse supply shock and there's a raging debate about what you  do when bad things happen on the supply side. there are no good answers, the  short version of that. i just summarized a lot of  academic debate in one easy  answer, which is, you're just  worse off and you face worse  choices.  so it would be better to have -- this is an obvious statement. better to have a shorter strike  rather than a longer one, and i  think the middle east is more  complex because in are  underlying medium-term issues  there. in particular the conflict  between fundamentally suni and  shia states that presumably does need to get resolved. again, i think the fundamental  point is, the federal reserve  just faces a worse set of  trade-offs with these kinds of  shocks in the economy.  >> i want to talk about the  banking business, ma m & a. and lina khan apparently used on the campaign trail on behalf of  vice president harris, if you  saw that. she's going to be going to a  couple different places, i'm  told, with bernie sanders in  some cases. does this seem advisable to you? >> i have not seen that headline and highly unusual for head of  an independent agency to do.  >> so sounds shrike you think  it's not advisable. also curious what you think, as  somebody who, has been a  long-time democrat, whether you  think that is an advisable thing for the vice president? >> again, i haven't seen that  headline. i don't want to be commenting on something i haven't seen. >> we're telling you about it. say it's true. >> headline where? hypothetically, if it were true. as we know, not all headlines  are accurate.  >> okay. telling you right now, you would not say something -- i take your word for it.  >> i believe i was reading it in a couple places.  >> now he's checking. now i'm worried.  >> no, no, no. >> i think the regulatory  environment is going to evolve,  because, again, as i've said  many times before. the laws have not changed. the current occupant of the  seats of the ftc and doj are  interpreting the laws <br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> east program senior fellow at  the carnegie endowment for  international peace. following this very closely, and commenting along the way. what did you think of the strike yesterday? what do you think israel's  reaction will be? >> the strike yesterday, becky,  was much more significant than  iran's attack last april. jake sullivan, the national  security advisers called this a  significant escalation and i  think we're likely to see a much more significant israeli  retaliation ongoing than we did  last april. it's been reported that among  the things that israel is,  israeli security cabinet members are deliberating or attacks on  iran's oil installations or even attacks on iran's nuclear  facility. this is really a dangerous  moment in the middle east. >> did iran not think that was  the case? will they be surprised by  retaliation for the strikes last night? >> they have to be expecting an  israeli retaliation. i think the position that iran  felt it was in was that when  they didn't respond to some of  israel's actions in lebanon, and including israel's assassination of the hamas leader several  weeks backing i don't responding they felt they showed weakness  and vulnerable and felt they  needed to respond. i think they responded too  strongly and now bracing for a  much stronger israeli ret<br>s retal retaliation.  >> if we were in these responses and counterresponses we've seen  before, if that was the case  until yesterday, what do you  think this means more broadly? in terms of a regional  conflagration that draws in  others? if the united states already  said we support israel in this,  what does that mean? >> i think we're already  entering unchartered waters in  the middle east, and that if  israel attacks iran's oil  facilities or iran's nuclear  facilities, you know, that has  major ramifications for the  global economy. oil prices skyrocketing. i think the chinese obviously  are not going to be pleased with that. i think the russians, although  russians are aligned, ironically may privately welcome a spike in oil prices. if israel attacks iran's nuclear facilities there is a danger  that iran announces they're now  moving full-speed ahead forward  for nuclear weapons. a lot of times israel takes  action walt consulting prior  with the united states. something of this mag magnitude  they're probably working very  closely with the biden  administration to coordinate and cap brate the right retaliation  against iran.  >> meaning an attack on nuclear  facilities it would have been  condoned by the united states,  and do you think that's likely? >> i suspect, i haven't spoken  to anyone about this in the last 24 hours, but i suspect the  biden administration is trying  to get the israelis to exercise  restraint over an attack on  iran's nuclear facilities,  because that, indeed, could  trigger iran to try to move  full-speed ahead towards a  weapon, which is something the  united states obviously wants <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Still a supportive environment for continued appreciation of equities: Sand Hill's Brenda Vingiello<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> bring in brenda, chief  investment officer at sand hill  global advisers. a couple of things happening  that have got us concerned,  brenda, but i'm looking at the  notes you gave to our people. you've got, like, ten things  that make you very sanguine. even though the market's up so  much you think the combination  of the fed going back to  neutral, or  >> , i.e., lowering  rates, gdp continue to grow and  weight-loss drugs, street  spending all bodes well for  continued moves higher? >> i do think so. although i think you look at  just a broad s&p 500, for  example. i don't think there's as much  upside. certainly we've had a huge move. we think about 5 to 7% left. look down at the individual  stock level, small and mid-cap  stocks valuation is reasonable. a lot more i will say, yes, in a positive  environment. obviously there are risks. reminded of the geopolitical  risks out there. more recently. but i do think that if we look  at the big picture in the united states, the economy is still  growing nicely. much faster than they thought it would and we have big, huge  thematic growth stories going on and multiple growth stories  which is rare. i think that is in combination  with the fed lowering interest  rates. i do think it's still a very  supportive environment for a  continued appreciation of the  equity market, but the other  pete happening with rates coming down is bonds have finally  started to deliver a positive  return.  during the third quarter. bonds were almost up as much as  the s&p 500. encourag encouraging. that serves as a nice buffer, i  think, for investors during  moments like this, when there is volatile times a flight to  safety. i think bonds have now resumed  their historical role in terms  of being not only a protector  during volatility, also one of  really an asset class that can  add value and return to  portfolios.  >> interesting. it's not a zero come game where  money comes out of the stock  market to go into the bond  market. a lot of times bonds and stocks  moving in tendom can be a  positive. do you think the amount of money on sidelines, that you feel  better about valuations? i mean, 22 times, that's rich. but when i say that to you,  still a lot of money on  sidelines. does it make you uncomfortable? seems to be a place where  further advances are going to be more hard-earned, seems like? >> i agree and i think coming  into earnings, that's going to  be important. we need to really understand,  you know, running next year too  low? an argument for further  appreciation. look at other areas, like small  and mid-cap, both trading around 16 times forward earnings, much  more attractively valued. also look below the surface. x out the magnificent seven,  there are definitely  opportunities within other  sectors, and we've seen a  broadening of market  participation over the last  quarter or so. i think that is likely to  continue.  so i think<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Former NEC Director Gary Cohn: Port strike will have real short-term impact on the U.S. economy<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> night's vice presidential debate between jd vance and tim walz. we are joined this morning by  former s.e.c. chairman jay  clayton. he's now apollo's nonexecutive  chair and cnbc contributor. also gary cohn, who is former  nac director, now ibm vice chair as well. thank you, both, for being here  this morning. why don't we start with what we  learn ed last night. what did you take away from it? >> here is my takeaway, that i  said it before, the american  people are smart. and these candidates responded  to the american people asking  for substance. we had substance last night on  the economy. we had substance on border. and we had substance on conflict in the middle east and ukraine. and that is because the  campaigns responded to the  american people saying, give us  something instead of calling  each other names.  >> by the way, civility, i  think, too, the other thing that came away from this.  >> i was very impressed by the  substance and i was particularly impressed by jd's substance. not just isolated on those  issues, but across those issues. how they all tie together. the american people know that a  strong economy, strong national  defense, and, you know,  immigration, migration, where  we're going forward, they all  tie together. and i thought he did a  particularly good job of being  consistent across those issues.  >> gary, what did you think on  the economy? the issues that came out there? >> i think on the economy,  again, i'm not sure we learned a lot. i don't think any new policy was put out. in fact, the only new policy put out since we were here last is  the harris/walz team did put out their 82-page economic platform, which is quite interesting and  maybe we should spend some time  talking about that. >> let's do it. >> what we learned, and i think  what they continue to do is they continue to reiterate that what  you have seen in the past is  what you're going to get in the  future. so what you saw from the trump  administration during their four years, their policy of lower  taxes, very accommodated from  the regulatory standpoint,  trying to grow the economy, they continue to reiterate that. from the harris/walz team, they  put out 82 pages of new and  bigger entitlements. like, i could go through the  list, i'm not sure we have  enough time, we talk about new  housing credits, small business  credits, forgiveness of student  loans, higher inflation,  enhanced child credits,  preschool credits, long-term  care credits, paid family leave  credits, government control of  healthcare, price controls, i  think you go --  >> you're right. i think you're absolutely right  that there is a big change, but  i would say it is the same from  both campaigns, because i would  say former president trump laid  out a pretty long litany of  things on the campaign trail he  would spend on. and we're not looking at a whole lot of ways to raise it outside  of tariffs. i think both campaigns are  talking about pretty aggressive  shifts from what we have seen in the past.  >> i think this is what  bidenomics is. i think the harris/walz team  laid out in 82 pages bidenomics. now we can call harris and i  think what you've seen from the  trump/vance team is you've seen  a reiteration of what they did  in the past. they continued to talk about  lowering taxes. they do continue to talk about  tariffs. we talked about tariffs, where  they're effective and not  effective. they continue to talk about  growing the economy. growing the economy so we have a higher gdp, so everyone gets  raised up. so we can grow wages, we can  grow therise. the other is redistribution of  the economy. >> the two things that really  strike me now, though, is, we  are faced with massive news  issues talking about all  morning. one would be what's happening in the middle east. second would be the strike with  the longshoremen and maybe start with the easier one first being  the longshoremen.  >> yeah. so we were talking, jay powell,  i think everybody's giving him  high marks for where we are in  trying to land this.  what's not in the textbooks, a  port strike. not in the textbooks, increased  conflict in the middle east. energy price shock if that comes about. these things are not there, and  both of them are inflationary.  >> yeah.  >> so what do you do if you're  at the fed? done very well here. you've kind of brought demand  down. and all of a sudden --  you have two -- fed has a  tougher job than a week ago. >> and what happens? gary, looking at it from the  economic perspective. talking how three-tenths of a  percent cut off gdp this week  and every week thereafter? >> look, jay said. talking about this a lot. this is a much tougher scenario, and we haven't thrown the middle east in there or thrown a major  oil shock. haven't thrown in there closing  the suez canal and making  shipping routes completely  different and we know the  difference in shipping costs  going around africa and through  the mediterranean. these things are highly  inflationary. they will -- this will be the  real definition of transitory  inflation. back to where we thought we were four years ago. transitory inflation, a port  strike. real disruption in the middle  east, and shipping lanes and  oil. this is all, we'll have real,  short-term impact on the u.s.  economy. i think chair powell sort of  started foreshadowing that last  week. where he started talking about a slower, more methodical move. i think he was foreshadowing  exactly what he thought may be  in the cards with the port  strike, but we got the 50 basis  points, which we always thought  was 25 at jackson hole and 25 at the meeting. that was the 50. then thought 25 more in the next two meetings. look, i think there's still  probably 25 more in the next two meetings but it's not as  positive -- i'm not as positive  today as i was last time i sat  there, because of the port  strike and because of what's  going on in the middle east. these things can amplify very,  very quickly.  >> show you video, which you may have seen. this is head of longshoremen  union, and this is what he had  to say. show you this video.  >> who's going to win here in  the long run? you better off sitting down and  let's get a contract and let's  move on with this world and in  today's world, i'll cripple ya. i will cripple you, and you have no idea what that means.  >> and then he goes on to  suggest how he's going to  cripple the country by all of  the different various people who are going to lose their job,  and -- by the way, he's a trump  supporter.  known to be. i'm curious actually what your  reaction is to that and what you think either former president  trump should be taysaying about  this or vice president harris  should bsaying? >> let me jump on this. both sides are hoping to get the sfro vote from labor. right? >> totally.  >> we want people to have good  jobs. what is one of the worst things  that can happen representing a  constituency? you go from having the american  people behind you to losing the  american people. what i saw in that video,  someone who's going to lose the  american people if he's going to tell you, i'm going to jam you  for money. even worse. i'm going to jam you for money  and we want to prohibition on  technology coming to ports in  america. that's -- that's saying, we want a job for life. we're going to hold you up --  >> political implications should be what you think leading  politicians in this election  shou<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Fundstrat's Tom Lee on 6,000 S&P 500 year-end target: Setup into year-end has a lot of tailwinds<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> his latest musings on the  markets. managing partner, head of  research at fund strike global  adviser and cnbc contributor. people forget, i think, but your outlook and views are always  nuanced to some extent, tom. last time you were on, after  being pretty bullish on small  caps through the end of the  year, i wouldn't say you didn't  change that long-term view. but you did express some  near-term caution and the people that follow you, the people that watch "squawk box," they want to know exactly what to do every  minute of every day. look to them like you had  waffled on your long-term view. and you're going to say the same thing today. i think near-term, you  acknowledge that there could be  some bumpiness, choppiness. by the end of the year, you  think 6,000 on the s&p.  >> that's right. i think we're still in the midst of a very tricky period because  we have got the election in less than 35 days. and now we have got two things  that investors don't know how to discount. one is the mounting tensions in  the middle east and a port  strike that is potentially going to cripple the economy. and so, i think that as  investors worry about this, if  we get a dip, a big dip, i think you still want to buy that dip,  because the setup into your end  has a lot of tail ends. >> the worst case scenario for  the port situation is something  that we have seen. and we shut down an economy  already. and that was probably a time to  buy. we know that. so we have seen that movie  before. could it be -- i can't imagine  it could be as bad as the  pandemic. but we have shut down an economy before. >> yeah, that's right. so i think it creates headline  risk, the longer this strike  lasts, there will be companies  that miss. s&p earnings might get  downgraded or some stocks might  miss results. but that's all just temporary. those are just short-term  headwinds because it doesn't  change the long-term outlook. >> very strange that it -- i  don't remember any war that  lasts where the effects -- we  have been through quite a few,  back in the '90s and the 2000s,  it never seemed to have the --  as negative an effect on the  overall market as we thought at  the beginning of each.  >> if we look at the last six  sort of global wars or tensions, almost always buy the invasion. the exception was 2022, with the russia-ukraine war, because we  were in the midst of a fed  tightening cycle. so that was not the buy the  invasion event. the other times you did want to  buy. >> both iraq wars.  >> yes, both iraq and --  >> where was the market before  that happened? had levels come down or were  they trading at near highs or at highs? >> yes. you know, this is different  because we are hovering near  highs and we're in an extended  market.  >> things aren't cheap in terms  of multiples.  >> that's right. but at the same time we also  know there is a lot of cash on  the sidelines because margins,  hasn't risen for four months. that's pretty unusual with the  rising stock market. and now money market cash has  actually been rising at a time  when the fed is cutting. so i do think there is  firepower. >> the other issue, just the  longshoremen strike, if that  goes on for an extended period  of time, is that something -- we were talking before how much  that cuts off the gdp. if it is there for a week,  cuts .3 of the gdp. >> yeah. >> for every week they're out. is that something that the fed  comes in with much more  aggressive cuts and that fixes  things or are there inflationary factors that also come into play and that ties their hands? >> i mean, the fed has to kind  of put that in their calculus  because the labor market  softened. if this is a shock in a way that causes the labor market to  weaken, the fed is going to be  more dovish. but we get the payroll support  friday and i would say maybe it  sort of early hints seems like  it is going to be a better than  expected report. >> bet then you also add in what would happen from inflationary  pressures, not only from the  longshoremen strike, but  potentially from oil prices  going up in the middle east too. >> that's right. i think the fed at this point  will be more concerned if the  consumer expectations got  unanchored on inflation and  those have been improving. so, i think the fed can be less  worried about the inflation  side.  >> did you see tepper talking  about john? would you ever ascribe to that  theory, buy a lot in china? >> i would say that not only di  is working right, because the  stock market is -- has really  broken out. i think china is the best  performing stock market this  year.  >> was the move made -- i think  we had kyle bass on yesterday,  and i think he would argue  long-term no matter how you want to think about china, it is a  bad bet. he was suggesting in the  short-term, it is a good bet. i don't think he was necessarily opining on whether the bet was  over. but the move -- the big move has happened, the question is do you see that doubling? is that in the cards at this  point in the game? >> yeah, i mean, something to  keep in the back of their mind,  china underperformed the u.s. by 7700 basis points. it still underperformed by high  thousand basis points. there is a lot of room for a  rally, even if it looks  corrective. >> i think, you know, his phrase was something like just a bad  bet on communists. >> he's saying long-term it is a bad bet, but short-term --  >> it is not our grandfather<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Iran missile attack gives Israel the grounds it needs to respond big, says Dan Senor<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> box." on tuesday, iran -- to discuss  the latest developments in the  middle east, former foreign  policy adviser to the bush  administration, the co-author of "the genius of israel" and host  of the podcast "call me back." we talked about how this  escalates, where this goes next  and what israel does next to  retaliate and how they do. and i'm curious where you land  on the big question as to how  they retaliate. do they go after nuclear  reactors and the like? we were having a conversation  earlier with the colonel in the  last hour who was suggesting  maybe you go after some of the  refineries or other things, but  that may be one step too far if  you were to go after the nuclear reactors. >> first of all, obviously  israel made it clear they will  react. there is very interesting signs. while the prime minister and his team tend to be sometimes shall  we say quite intense in their  rhetorical responses to these  moments, the idf army spokesman, chief of staff team tends to be  pretty restrained. they sound as hot right now as  any israeli politician. so there is total kind of --  totally synced up, the military  and the political echelon, a. b, the u.s. government. in mid-april, when israel dealt  with that iran attack, the u.s.  obviously participated in the  defense of israel. but then the u.s. caution ed  response. president biden said take the  win, you don't need to respond. look what jake sullivan said  yesterday, he made it clear not  only should israel respond,  israel has a right to respond,  but that the u.s. is going to  participate in the response. and then you just roll back and  look at the following. one, iran has made clear for  years that it has what it calls  its annihilation strategy. meaning it has been developing a strategy to annihilate israel,  to annihilate the jewish people. we saw the beginning of it on  october 7th. we saw the continuation from  hamas in the south. we saw the continuation of it on october 8th from hezbollah in  the north. we have seen the various proxies in the region piling on, all  orchestrated by iran. israel's view is they're doing  it, they're trying to annihilate us, this is the moment to  respond. and i think the supreme leader  of iran made a massive  miscalculation with this attack  yesterday. because it gave israel whatever  grounds it needed to respond, to respond big and i think if the  iranian nuclear program is left  fully in tact, and on path  toward a weapons breakout, which it is, at the end of this, it  will be a huge missed  opportunity for israel and i  think the israeli leadership  recognizes that.  >> the question is, can israel  successfully eliminate that  nuclear program or damage it? what does that look like? and then in the war gaming of  this, what is the retaliation  from there? and i ask because there has been some conjecture that -- i don't  believe this, but that even what we saw yesterday from iran, not  to suggest was performative, if  you will, but there was -- that  israel knew enough of this was  coming, and what would happen  after that.  >> they told them it was coming. >> right, so, first of all, the  iranian program, basically based in two areas, in letans and  fordo. one area is above ground and one is below ground. the israelis believe -- and  others believe too that the  capabilities that are above  ground is very reachable, and  can serious damage can be done  to it. the question is what to do to  the program below ground. it is not binary. the israelis don't view it as  binary. it is not can you take  everything out or not. the question is can you do real  damage to the program, set it  back considerably. a few weeks ago, the director of nat national intelligence in the  u.s. came before congress and  issued a report saying for the  first time we have no confidence that the iranian government has  put their nuclear program on  anything but inactive, meaning  that it -- there are signs it is moving forward. what is the time frame when they move forward? is it one to two weeks to get a  bomb, one to two months to get a bomb? we don't know. we know the window has gotten  shorter and shorter over the  past few years. from israel's perspective, if  they can do real damage to the  nuclear program to the point  that they expand the window, so  instead of being one to two  weeks or one to two months,  suppose they do enough damage  that it is one to two years, is  it worth it? probably. is there a risk that iran will  respond? yes. but how has iran always  responded? the loaded gun iran has had on  the table and facing israel has  been hezbollah. iran has been saying go ahead,  try and strike me. we have hezbollah on your  northern border, 200,000  rockets, the forces we now know  were planning their own version  of october 7th from the north,  we can light that up whenever we want. and that has always deterred  israel. the game changer over the last  couple of weeks is israel has  basically, not permanently, but  temporarily paralyzed that.  >> are you saying they did this  as a pry elude to an attack on   >> i think there were a series  of events that were kicked into  place following the pager attack and opportunities presented to  israel, they knew they had an  opportunity to really paralyze  hezbollah and it worked. combination of air force assets  and intelligence, able to do a  lot of things. it was not inevitable that they  would go into iran. if that's your question. did they do hezbollah knowing  they're doing iran? i don't think that was the case. but i think they now realize  they have been so successful  with hezbollah, and, again,  there could be setbacks, i don't want to sound totally polly  annish, but so successful with  hezbollah, if there is ever a  time to deal with iran, it is  now. the supreme leader of iran gave  israel this opening by  attacking, which i think will be regarded as one of the great  miscalculations. >> what you are saying, though,  this time is different. everything that we have seen  along the way is different. which means the retaliatory  strike may be different too. whatever iran comes back with  next. what do you think happens with  egypt and syria? >> i think with egypt and syria, i think all the sunni states are basically rooting, publicly or  privately, rooting for israel to do what it's doing. after the pager strike --  >> that's what i wanted to get  to, how has this changed the  whole dynamic for bibi  netanyahu? he was by so many people around  israel, i don't want to say  hated, but disliked by a lot of  people and feels like something  has shifted in the past week and a half. >> look, i think netanyahu's  political future will remain to  be seen. i think he's got serious  challenges to his own political  future. that said, there is nothing like momentum in a sense like you're  finally off your back foot and  winning to change your political and your geopolitical  positioning. and i think there is a sense  inside israel, finally, we're  not just in defense mode. keep in mind, israel's war in  gaza has been israel responding  defensively to gaza. and it has been quite effective, but still a muddle. now with the threat in the north and the threat from tehran,  there is a sense that israel is  on the front foot that israel  actually is proactively dealing  with threats that israel has had to deal with for years. >> do you think iran -- i want  to say, geopolitically, the  saudis, the emiratis, the  bahrainis, the egyptians,  jordanians, they fear the threat of iran and iran becoming a  hegemonic power in the region. i'm telling you, many of them  are saying it, you know,  publicly, even more saying it  privately. i heard from a number of  officials who said we want  israel to -- this round, we may  have our frustrations with what  they have done in gouaza, hassa  nasrallah of hezbollah<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu: The impact of last night's VP debate was marginal<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> pro-worker part of the biden  administration, it's the one  issue where kamala harris has  run away from joe biden's  record.  >> that was ohio senator jd  vance facing off with minnesota  governor tim walz last night in  the debate. i want to bring in colorado  democrat governor jared polis. al also, new hampshire governor  chris. maybe we can talk about the  vibes of the campaign, if you  will, in terms of how jd vance  -- we were talking earlier, he  went into this not the most  loved. i don't know if you think he  came out of this in a different  place.  >> look, i think the remarks you just played shows the economic  illiteracy of the republican  party. they have taken a hard turn  against free markets, the free  exchange of goods across  borders. you saw jd vance doubling down  on trump's tariffs, 20%  universal tariff. devastating for the economy. increasing prices on a whole  range of household goods. we just had back-to-school  shopping. everything we buy, backpacks,  socks, shoes, all costing more  and really hitting the economy. that's what that means. kamala harris understands. of course there are geo  complexities with china. let's work with asia, mexico,  canada. let's expand trade relationships rather than drive them toward a  weaker america.  >> traditional republican  values, right? >> look. if you want to get into the  economics of the situation,  there's one thing that every  swing voter cares about,  inflation. the cost of living. that's it. people want to pay their rent,  buy groceries. he hit that home four years ago. today it's stark. you can go back to the  presidential debate where kamala harris absolutely failed to  answer that question.  >> on the economic --  >> how does adding 20% to the  cost of nearly every household  good, how does that decrease  inflation or help anybody? it just decreases everybody's  buying power, not to mention the jobs that would be destroyed  directly as well as the jobs  that would be hit with  retaliatory tariffs. american exports are great. trade is fundamentally good when two people engage --  >> i have a question about  inflation during the last four  years.  >> look, inflation is coming  down, and i think we need to  continue that. the fact is donald trump's  budget would double the size of  the deficit compares to kamala  harris's buchlgt deficit  spending is a big driver of  infla tigges and a big driver of mortgage rates. >> how do you answer the last  four-year question? it's the question most democrats struggle with.  >> when inflation is coming down in the right way. what's the question? >> the question is housing is up 60%. the question is people can't  afford to go to mcdonald's  anymore. that's the litmus test where  everyone goes this is screwed  up. this is not the america we  bought into.  >> under donald trump that gets  worse with 20% tariff on every  household item. let's not restrict supply. let's allow housing to be built. kamala harris talks about 3  million new homes, removing  paperwork, bureau okay rahcy,  making it easier to rebuild. we're doing it at the state  level in colorado. we need to do it nationwide to  allow it --  >> inflation coming down means  that prices are going up less  quickly than before so that the  20%'s already there and now  they're still rising 2.5%, 3%,  so inflation is coming down --  >> you don't want deflation  either. >> a 20% tariff is not there  yet.  >> trump was president for four  years with tariffs and we saw  1.9%. >> this is new, this 20% deal.  >> right. because the tariffs he put on  are still in place with the  biden administration, but we did not -- we had 1.9% inflation  under trump.  >> biden did unwind some of  those tariffs. not the solar ones. i wish he did. >> i think -- let's take a step  back and go what was the impact  of last night, right? i think the impact was two  things. i think they both did well. tim did well. jd did very, very well. in terms of winning the debate,  will it have an impact? marginal. there's only a percentage of  swing state voters. i don't know about this. a lot of folks are reassured,  there's real sanity here, this  isn't just trump and trump-like. i think jd shored that up in a  very, very strong way. i think tim did that for kamala  as well. he did better than she did in  her debate. there's a huge positive where  america takes a big sigh of  relief and goes, way, wait, the  future in america is bright. weoptimistic. regardless of who ease  president, we have real thinkers who know about policy and do it  the right way.  >> let me ask you about two news headline, one that's economic  and one that could be economic,  which is ports. how does this play into the  election, and how do the  democrats respond, meaning do  they support the folks and  workers at the ports or not? everybody is in the -- i would  say both sides are in an  interesting box here.  >> first, it's going to drive  inflation. i mean, it's going to drive  costs, there's no question, if  this goes on. the democrats are in a bit of a  pickle because they're so  pro-union. the union rejected a 50% pay  raise. i don't know of any american who would reject a 50% pay raise. but they have.  >> i don't see trump out there  saying --  >> he doesn't have to because  joe biden and kamala harris run  the white house. they should be the ones to  intervene.  >> these are union workers  trying to get trump elected. you know that too.  >> this is the responsibility of -- i love gina raimondo, but she was on saying, oh, yeah, we're  not paying attention to what's  going on with one of the biggest strikes in american history. that's a big issue in itself. what we saw out of iran is very  destabilizing. i don't see things are get  everything better ore the next  five weeks where kamala harris  can take credit.  >> again, we talk about trade,  which trump could cripple. and both sides should be able to get in a room to hash out a  deal. we'll have less strikes and --  >> did you see what the head of  the union said? he basically wants to cripple  the whole country.  >> he's a trump guy.  >> is that not shocking to you? that it is like donald trump was to cripple border security too  by not giving us the resources  we need. there is this theme among some  in the republican party where  they want to k<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Haines: The worst possibly happening has markedly increased.<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> for more on the potential risk  for investors an wall street,  we're joined by terry haines,  founder and head of political an all sis. terry, good morning. it's good to see you.  >> good morning, frank.  >> you say this for investors,  this tire situation is the big  effort geopolitical risk. explain that thesis. didn't we see something very  similar as far as tensions  between israel and iran back in  umbrella? >> we did, but what we've got in the highest geopolitical risk  here, we've got a combination of two hot wars, one in yurk and  one in the middle east and a  near war in the south china sea  where china is trying to  proveeck against the philippines and others. tensions are very, very high. what you get out of the markets  by and large is a conventional  response, concerns about oil  prices and the like. what's different about this,  though, in the middle east  compared to pretty much every  other middle east war or  conflict going back all the way  to 1947 is that one side doesn't want to compromise. one side plainly isn't  interested. and, in fact, what we've got, as you point out, is a direct  confrontation between two of the major powers in the region, iran and israel, and a situation  where neither side is  particularly interested in  standing down. so this is a moment of, i think, unprecedented peril.  >> so you're saying it's a  combination. it's the ukraine/russia war,  what's going on in the south  china sea. it's all put together. you're saying the oil trade,  that's kind of a conventional  way of looking at it. what are the other ideas that  investors maybe aren't  considering? >> you know, what you need to do is, frankly, you know, kind of  massage your risks appropriately to, you know, get out of -- get  out of things that are  particularly in peril from all  these conflicts, including --  and take a close look at things  like the supply chains and the  like firstly. secondly, you know, generally  speaking, i've said that  investors ought to look at the  defense sector because what is  certain regardless of the u.s.  presidential election, frankly,  is that you're going to have  much greater u.s. defense  spending to respond to this  geopolitical risk. the u.s. among other things has  positioned itself against the  arsenal democracy and feels  strained by the ability to  supply allies, and so that's  going to be -- you know,  frankly, job one for whoever the new president and whatever the  new congress is.  >> defense stocks, that's one of the things you're looking at. we showed this to one of our  guestserle letter. you can see the big jump after  this news. i have to ask you, isn't there  already priced in? we literally saw a very  high-stakes attack. ballistic missiles. it wasn't drones this time  around. we kind of know what's going on. >> we kind of know what's going  on, but it's really one of two  things. one is the possibility of  something snapping and  geopolitical risks jumping still higher, i think, is not  completely priced in. there is, among other things,  the will to believe, and the  will to believe in this case is  that the worst won't happen. you know, i still think that's  the best-case scenario, but the  worst possibly happening has  marketed will increased just in  the last few weeks firstly. secondly, i think investors  aren't focusing on the likely  u.s. response post-election to  replenishing defense stocks and  ramping up defense capabilities. that's not something that gets  talked about during the  presidential election. neither candidate, for example,  last night talked about it at  all with any specificity, but  that's going to be job one  post-election, and markets ought to be ready for it.  >> you say it's to their peril. you say the oil trades are tired at this point. it's kind of a very predictable  way to play this. it sounds like the safe haven  trades are overdone. what are the other ways as an  investor you can play this if  those things are passed on? >> i would look at, frankly, you know, the united states has been transparent in the areas where  it feels that it is deficient. you know, there are a variety of studies released over the past  year. but i would look not just at  defense stocks per se. i would look at kind of the  broader support, what gets  called the defense industrial  base because the defense  industrial base overall is  something that the united states government on a bipartisan basis real<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Higgins: Tesla has been very aggressive in adjusting its prices<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> he's also a cnb contributor and  author of "power play." item, good to see you.  >> good morning. >> why don't we start with  tesla. we mentioned your book right  there. looking at the delivery numbers, the forecast is for 6% increase  year over year, 4 f 3,000  deliveries. can you put that in context for  us? a year over year-increase,  that's always good, escalation  in costs, that's always good. we keep talking about rising  competition. in that context, f% rise in  deliveries, what does that mean  for tesla? >> it's not as good as it's been in the past few years. we've seen explosive growth for  tesla. in the beginning of the year,  not seeing that. the first two quarters were  down. returning to growth, the tesla  story is what they need. investors looking for the idea  that the company's going to be  growing hugely in the next few  years. part of that is this week's  announcement. part of that will be next week's announcement where elon is  supposed to be giving more of  his kind of vision for the  future. if you're an investor, those are the kinds of things you look  for, beating expectations  hopefully today and then next  week's announcement.  >> you know, haver quickly, i  want to hit some of these other  automakers. what are your expectations? is that also going to be a stock mover or is a lot of that priced in, that he's going to come out  with innovation when it comes to all on themy and pricing in all  of those things? >> we've kind of seen that. a lot of investors don't expect  this in the near term. looking at the results this  month, there's going to be a lot of interest in how they're doing in china. the expectation is that today's  results were probably largely  due to china sales. tesla has been very aggressive  in adjusting its prices ore  there as it competes against  foreign rivals or chinese local  rivals in the ev phase. it's kind of a two-punch if you  will. investments want to see the  excitement for the future and  where they're coming in on  profitability with the expected  earnings results.  >> let's talk about stellantis  very quickly. they raised their guidance for  sending less vehicles to the  united states and north america. before it was 100,000. now it's 200,000. one of the things they cited is  increased chinese competition,  but we don't sell a lot of  chinese vehicles in north  america. what's going on with stellantis? >> stellantis is kind of two  stories there. the european automakers are  talking about challenges in  china. stellantis in the u.s. has been  troubled for months now. a lot of observers noticed  things had been swelling,  dealers concerned about their  inventories and pressuring the  company to mark down or put  incentives to move that metal. you have to remember that  chrysler jeep has made a lot of  money from selling expensive  suvs, and we're in a market  where consumers are looking for  cheaper vehicles. remember, the average cost of a  new vehicle sold in the u.s. was about $10,000 more than it was  right before covid really sent  prices skyrocketing at the end  of 2019. so right now there's this kind  of belief that consumers may be  priced out of these vehicles. even with the fed lowering  rates. kind of put pressure to lower  prices in the next few months. not just for stellantis but  general motors and ford. kind of the end of the grave  train we've seen in the last few years.  >>> in the last quarter they  reported they're going to  increase the production of their vehicles, but hybrid vehicles is sparking a lot of sales growth. what are you expecting from  ford? >> the hybrid is an interesting  kind of evolution in the  marketplace. for so long we've seen it. ford and toyota have really  found success in that ki<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Guggenheim’s Bob Drbul on Nike Q1 results: Still a very tough task at hand for new CEO Elliott Hill<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> joe, meta, alphabet, among some  of the names to keep a close eye on. the analyst reports driving some of the market action. i'll send things back over to  you guys.  >> great. thank you, dom. >>> nike shares are sharply  lower this morning. the company reported earnings  that beat the street's  estimates, but revenue fell  short. nike withdrew its full year  guidance and postponed investor  day as it prepares for its new  ceo to take over on october  14th. joining us right now is bob  derbil, guggenheim securities  expert research analyst. if i have to look through this,  the stock indicated down pretty  sharply, back to 84.20. but if you think about it,  that's still above where it was  when you heard that donahue was  out and was stepping down and  elliott hill would be coming  back in. okay, he may be gone, but the  problems at nike still remain.  >> yeah. there is still a tough task at  hand for elliott as he comes in. i think what we got was just a  better place setting for the  table to see, okay, what really  does he have to deal with as we  move forward, and i think, you  know, the quarter was largely in line with expectations. inventories were a little higher than we would have liked. i think sales came in a little  lighter. and the environment isn't great. and competition isn't going  away. so, you know, i think as we look forward, the next few months  aren't critical. i think what we're really  focused on is the next few years for these guys with the new  chapter at hand here. >> and i think maybe some of the stuff that came out in the call  was concerning, just about how  long this is going to take. they made the point on the call  that their deliberate pullback  from top brands, whether that be air force one and air jordan  one, that's going to last. they can't fix that immediately. that's going to last through the end of the fiscal year, which  doesn't end until may of next  year.  >> i think it is supply and  demand. imbalance. they're focused on it. the good news is they do have  their order book being finalized for the spring, so they will be  able to sort of, you know,  better check, you know, what  their inventories are in the  spring versus where they are  right now. and i think that those  businesses are manageable,  they're managed lower. i think some of the newer  initiatives at hand and some of  the new shoes they're bringing  out are encouraging, but a small piece of the puzzle right now.  >> my guess is even though  elliott hill hasn't started yet, that's not until later this  month, my guess is he's already  made all kinds of calls and had  all kinds of meetings with  retailers and others who are so  important to them.  >> no, i think -- i think there  is a lot of discussion about the investor day being postponed. i think it was the right thing  to do. give elliott hill some time to  put his team together. meet with his retail partners,  you know, try to figure out what is working and what's not and  give the guy a little bit of  time and we'll figure it out  from there. but --  >> what about the stock this  morning? now we're looking at it 83 and  change. does that make sense for the  business, what it is going to  deliver over the next six months to a year? >> i think it does. i think when you have a change  in leadership, you know, we're  all trying to figure out what  exactly he's going to do  differently. elliott's experience is very  marketplace oriented and i think that's one of the biggest  challenges that they have at  hand, which was they have given  up a lot of shelf space with  their retail partners, so they  got to win them back, basketball continues to be very strong, but the running area, they said  running was up double digit, it  is smaller than it was, they got a lot of new shoes coming out  over the next several quarters. and i think that's the critical  piece and i think they really  need to focus on innovation with some new products to really jump start --  >> particularly in running? >> definitely.  >> that's where they're facing  the biggest competition.  >> you think this is fairly  priced, you wouldn't necessarily say to buy it here, wait and see what happens? >> our target is 110 now. we took it down slightly.  >> 110 is higher than 83.  >> yeah, no, because i think  ultimately you've got -- i think the brand remains very strong,  very competitive. the balance sheet, you know, $10 billion of cash, they had this  treasury -- war chest they can  really compete with financially. and the retailers really want to partner with nike. when nike is successful, the  industry is successful. i think there is a lot<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Excess OPEC capacity keeping oil prices from spiking after Iran attack, says CIBC's Rebecca Babin<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> yesterday amid iran's ballistic  missile attack on israel, but  this morning saudi's oil  ministers warning fellow opec  members prices could plunge if  countries don't abite by the  production limits. we're talking wti. it's $72. brent is at $75.73. joining us right now is rebecca  babin. rebecca, i have to say, i'm  actually surprised you're not  seeing prices quite a bit higher from here. when you look at iran having  this complete number of, you  know, hundreds of ballistic  missiles falling on israel, the  idf saying they're going to  respond and the u.s. saying  they're going to back up israel. it doesn't get much bigger. why don't you think we haven't  seen a response in the oil  markets? >> yeah, i think the key to that is the responsibility that opec  has on the sidelines. you hinted at it in your  lead-in. mbs kmected crude call could  fall to the 50s if they go after market share as opposed to  supporting price. what that means is they bring  back a million plus barrels to  the sideline and they allow it  to increase production. the spare capacity they have is  over 4 million barrels a day. it would take a significant  supply production for opec not  at to be able to fill that gap. so the market looks at this  event that's happened with iran  and israel and says there is a  bigger chance we have a supply  disruption, but we're not as  afraid of ta tail event because  we know there's a lot of crude  sitting on the sidelines. and secondly we know right now  mbs and saudi arabia are very  frustrated with their other opec plus members for not complying  to the production cuts over the  past essentially years and are  more willing to potentially  release that supply back to the  market if we do get a price  spike than they have in the  past. so we think that's the setup as  to why crude is not seeing these huge kind of $10, $15 moves on  an event like this. ultimately there's plenty of  supply out there that can fill a gap. now, can it fill that gap  indefinitely? no. so there is a longer term big  picture here that i think this  could, if it does escalate and  devolve into something more  significant, you know, cause a  meaningful kind of uptick over  the long term with regard to  prices. in the short term, until we know what happens and the market  supply that we know is  comfortable with a buffer to the upside, we're seeing a mooted  response.  >> do you think they've not  factored in the idea that the  israelis could go after oil  production, oil refinery  facilities in iran? is that a reality in your view,  and is that factored into these  prices? >> i think it's a reality, and i think it is eantirely not  factored into the prices because if you look at the historical  events particular will i over  the last two years, if you look  at russia's invasion of ukraine  and everything that's happened  since october 7th, there's been  these spikes of geopolitical  events, ander s every single ti  it's not entered into it. so i think the market is kind of trained or desensitized to a  certain extent that supply will  come off the market, so i think  there is potentially the market  playing chicken here with these  events. i think there is a potential  that israel goes after iran  energy facilities. keep in mind that's 1.8 million  barrels of crude exports that  could be impacted. again, i said opec has 4  milliion barrels of supply  capacity sitting on the  sidelines, so it is a real  threat, but it might not  potentially be as devastating if we didn't have that buffer of  opec supply on the sideline.  >> we haven't talked about  demand at all because the reason people have given to this point  for oil prices not going higher  is demand for china is so weak. china laid in massive stimulus  plans to lay in stimulus and  economy. where should your prices be as a result? >> that's a great question. if anything, i would be very  surprised. industrials rise on the stimulus and crude does nothing. i think ultimately when you look at the makeup of the chinese  economy and the stimulus,  they're kind of setting forth  on, there's not a lot of  confidence that we're going to  see a massive increase in crude  oil demand as a result. i challenge that. i think the market is absolutely underestimating the fact that  chinese demand will improve with it. but the sentiment is  tremendously sour. they think next year we look at  a massive will i oversupplied  market and nobody is willing to  play upside in crude oil. if they think there's going to  be stimulus, they're looking at  the other industrial metals. the key is the fact we have this big buffer of supplies, sitting  on top of crude. what's the upside, right? if i'm wrong and it doesn't  improve, i've <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Ladner: Defense stocks are probably not a bad place to be right now.<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> 1907, 1929, 1987, and back in  2008. for much more, let's bring in  scott ladner, chief investment  officer for horizon investments. scott, great to have you here. mid east tensions, port strikes, there are a lot of things  investors should certainly  consider, but should they make  moves? is there anything they should do right now? >> in terms of the port strike  stuff, no, probably not. in the middle east stuff, it's  hard to tell. the market tends to look through it very well. we have to watch it pretty  carefully, but right now we're  still optimistic we can find a  path through it.  >> very quickly if we watch,  lockheed martin, raytheon,  l3harris, all of them up as you  look at the chart. is this the idea if you look at  the chart -- i know you mention  the head fake. we saw something like this in  april. we'll talk about it later in the show. either wei, it seems like more  money is going to go into the  defense. we have about 40,000 troops in  the middle east. is this the time to put much in  defense stocks? >> it's not a bad idea. neither one of these two  candidates are going to spend  much less, quite frankly. the world is not getting safer  especially when we have special  threats with china and taiwan. you always have to be careful. yeah, those defense stocks are  probably not a bad place to be  right now.  >> let's talk about something  else. the fed. we heard from jay powell earlier this week. what did you think? 450i7 threaticly it could be 25  and 25 in the last two meetings. a lot of people were thinking we might get 50 in the november  meeting.  >> i think he wants 25 and 25. if we get 25 and 25, that means  the labor market is cooling but  not cool. that means everything is on  plan. we have had a hint on friday. we're hoping for 25 and 25 as  well. we think it's a labor market  that will continue to cool but  not get cold.  >> isn't there a difference  between the labor market and the stockmarket? for example, i know you're kind  of bullish right now on the  biotech. wouldn't that help that sector? if you look at that sector, even since the cut we got, i'm  looking at the ibb, xbi, both  are down more than 2%. for the sector you're interested in, wouldn't another 50-point  basis cut be great? >> in isolation, sure. those are sectors that can be a  little bit levered into the  economy. the reason why we like biotech  and health care has more to do  with ai than the economy. it matters that we get to 50. it means they're getting too  slow and too weak, and that's  probably going to be a problem.  >> overall if we get the  25-point basis cut, what area do we expect to do well? is it cyclicals? what area are you looking at for opportunities if it goes --  looks like you expect? >> i think we can start looking  at small caps again. we can start looking at broader  aspects, value. specifically i'm talking about  homebuilders, financial strikes  would be interesting at that  point. anything that's more tied to  cyclical upturn, possibly also  in china as we're seeing right  now. thos<br>
