        "MONEY.\" McDONALD'S ROMMING  ROLLING OUT  LATEST ACEMENT TO GET CUSTOMERS  BACK INTO ITS RESTAURANTS. THE McVALUE PLATFORM FEATURING A BUY ONE ADD ONE FOR A DOLLAR  OPTION, AS WELL AS APP-SPECIFIC  DEALS. THE $5 MEAL DEAL SET TO STAY ON  THE MENU THROUGH NEXT SUMMER. FOR MORE, LERT'S T'S BRING IN N  SETIYAN.

COLI  SETBACK. IS THIS TO GET PEOPLE BACK THAT  THEY LOST FROM THAT INCIDENT? >> I THINK IT'S MORE THAN THAT. I THINK IT'S REALLY A FIGHT  AGAINST GROCERY, AND, YOU KNOW,  JUST THE FACT THAT THE CATEGORY  OF McDONALD'S IS NO EXCEPTION. TOOK TOO MUCH PRICING OVER THE  PAST FEW YEARS POST COVID, AND  GROCERY HAS TAKEN SHARE. THAT MEAL REPLACEMENT CUSTOMER,  WHICH IS ALMOST 30% OF  TRANSACTIONS IN QSR, INCLUDING  McDONALD'S, REALLY SHIFTED TO  GROCERY, GROCERY TRANSACTIONS  ARE UP 13% VERSUS, YOU KNOW,  2019, THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY  SEEING TRANSACTIONS DECLINE  ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT. SO, IT'S REALLY A FIGHT AGAINST  GROCERY. AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK  IN 2025. >> HOW DO YOU VIEW THESE DEALS? I MEAN, IS IT A SHORT-TERM HIT  TO EARNINGS, A SHORT-TERM HIT TO MARGINS, BUT A LONGER TERM GAIN  OF -- OF MARKET SHARE, OR -- OR, I MEAN, HOW DO YOU SORT OF  ASSESS THE IMPACT TO THE BOTTOM  LINE? >> I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK  IT'S GOING TO BE A NEGATIVE FOR  MARGINS. I THINK THEY'VE STRUCTURED THESE OFFERING IN SUCH A WAY WHERE  IT'S PRETTY NEUTRAL TO FOOD  COSTS, I MEAN, ULTIMATELY, YOU  KNOW, YOU CAN'T LOWER THE MENU  PRICES, BUT YOU CAN DRIVE  NEGATIVE MIX. AND I THINK THEY'RE SHOOTING FOR AN AVERAGE CHECK IN THE MID 1%  RANGE, VERSUS, YOU KNOW, THE  GROCERY OF MAYBE 1% INFLATION,  YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR, THAT GAP  WAS OVER 3%. AND SO, YOU KNOW, HISTORICALLY,  THE MEDIAN'S BEEN 1.6. SO, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GOING TO  DRIVE THAT GAP BELOW THE MEDIAN, I THINK THAT'S GOING TO RESULT  IN SOME -- SOME, YOU KNOW, GAINS AND TRANSACTIONS THAT THEY LOST  TO GROCERY OVER THE LAST COUPLE  OF YEARS. >> HEY, NICK, IT'S TIM. IT'S A FASCINATING DISCUSSION,  BECAUSE THERE'S NO QUESTION HOW  WE ALL FEEL IN THE GROCERY  STORE. BUT WHEN THEY INITIATE OR THEY  BROUGHT BACK OUT THE VALUE MEAL, A FEW MONTHS AGO, IT WAS REALLY  SEEN TO BE AN ATTACK WITHIN THE  INDUSTRY ON SOME COMPETITORS WHO HAVE WATCHED McDONALD'S COME IN  THIS, AND THE VALUE MEAL USUALLY STAYS LONGER THAN IT PLANNED,  AND IT USUALLY WORKS FOR  McDONALD'S. IS THERE A RELATIVE VALUE CALL  HERE ON McDONALD'S VERSUS  SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE SECTOR? >> YOU HAVE TO THINK THIS IS  GOING TO ACT AS A HALO FOR THE  ENTIRE CATEGORY. AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE SECOND HALF OF '24, BY THE WAY. WE'VE SEEN THAT AGGRESSIVE VALUE MESSAGING THROUGHOUT '24. AND THE ENTIRE CATEGORY HAS  BENEFITED. SO, I THINK THIS IS REALLY A  CONSIDERED FIGHT AGAINST GETTING SOME OF THAT -- SOME OF THE  TRANSACTIONS BACK THAT THE  ENTIRE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY LOST  TO -- TO GROCERY, AND IT'S NOT  JUST QSR, AS WELL, RIGHT?

        "Money.\" we have been tracking the  traders' acronyms all year and  it is finally time to reveal the winner of 2024, but before we  tell you who is on top, we have  to run through who almost walked away with the win. In fourth place, it is karen's  helm. She picked health care, energy,  lvmh and meta, which was her big winner this year. She was up 14%. In third place, the chart  master, carter's plug. Peloton, really pedaled higher  in the second half, propelling a 23% gain on the year. Steve grasso, the runner up,  with sage. Most of his picks outperformed  the broader market. He was up 28%. But our winner -- drum roll,  please. Mike khouw, with brave. B for bitcoin gave him the lead, soaring 1 22% last year. Along with his other picks, he  was up 34%. Mike khouw, congratulations, you are the winner of the 2024  acronym challenge, and the  recipient -- hold on. Of this illustrious trophy. >> ah, that's pretty. >> 2024. >> yeah, mike. All right, mike. >> he's got a spot picked out  for it. >> you feel good about this,  huh? this win, mike, huh? >> ah, i do. I actually have to tell you, i  felt better about how the  acronym was doing through the  end of the third quarter and  it's only since that time that,  you know, bitcoin really took  off, but a lot of the other  areas haven't been doing quite  so well. What we've really been seeing is the divergence in u.s./china  rates. That tells the whole story. The emerging markets picture got ugly on the back of that. The value group of stocks has  underperformed on a risk  adjusted basis, relative to the  s&p since then. So, all of that is a pretty  funky backdrop, but obviously  bitcoin helped carry me through  the finish line, even as the  other categories didn't perform  as well in the fourth quarter. >> again, congratulations, mike  khouw, and by the way, we will  unveil the 2025 acronyms  starting on monday, and the 2025 winner will get this trophy -- ",

        "Handicap here. That's not coming down. They've been very sluggish. We'll see.  >>> all right, meantime, katie  says it may be time to rotate  out of last year's high flyers  and into the 2024 laggards. Let's go off the charts. Katie, certainly, we saw some of that rotation that you're  predicting today. >> yeah, i would say that we're  already starting to see this  rotation, and first and  foremost, it's come from  software stocks. Those were among the biggest  outperformers of late, and we've seen a reversal of course in  that relative performance. If you look at software versus  semis, i agree with you, tim,  that semis may resurface as an  outperformer. Now, in a more neutral tape,  maybe that doesn't mean too  much, but that relationship  certainly seems to have shifted, and that would be from one  leading sector into a lagging  sector like semis. Now, also, we're seeing it  elsewhere and it's a bit more  defensive in the rotation, where health care specifically pharma  has caught a very short-term  bid. And i think that's pretty  interesting, also, in relative  terms. It seems to be occurring at the  expense of the mag seven, for  one, and also software. And we're seeing it in defense,  so, defense stocks, which have  really been under pressure, both in absolute and relative terms,  have negative momentum, and yet, they're oversold and they've  largely come into very strong  support levels. So, we're kind of interested. You see merck, you know, inch  above the 50-day moving average. You start to see some of the  stocks find their footing and to us, that seems to be a bit of a  trade. >> and all this within the  prism, for you, that we are due  for a correction in the first  quarter. >> yeah, you would expect to see those defensive sectors start to outperform at least in relative  terms versus the s&p, when  you're getting into more  skittish environment like we  believe we have right now. So, we think that defensive  positioning is correct on the  sector front, but we've been  recommending clients to be  hedged, from a top-town  perspective, when you see the  volatility pick up like it has  done.

        "And then, oh, is it going to be  a problem? i hope we see rates  s flow off. >> it was a big move on the  ten-year yield. Touching 4.7%. The move coming after the latest ism services data came in hotter than expected. The spread between ten and two  years now the highest since may  of 2022. So, fears about inflation  remaining out there, as  something for the market to  grapple with. >> so, we've all talked about  this, and if you have higher  rates because of growth and  you're looking at -- there's a  reason why you have higher  rates, there's a bullish reason, there's a bearish reason, but we have to remember, qt is still  going on, and qt is still  supportive of rates. So, you can't have cutting and  qt on the other side. That's a push pull, or a tug of  war. So, i -- i think the market is  on pace to see qt end in march. That's where you could see rates sort of come back in again. >> i think the -- we should be  talking about rates today. If you think about a ten-year  auction where -- this auction,  by the way, was -- it was fine. It was a nonevent in a world  where it would have been  eventful. Yet, we printed the highest  yield since 2007. The first auction that's printed that high since 2007. We know back in april, $4.70 was the close, and that's the close  to watch today. Ism services, we know that's the biggest part of our economy, was robust. The dynamics around the  technical components, though,  and i think that's the part of  this that i think steve is also  referring to. It's not just about growth. It's not just about inflation  there are technical come  appropriates here. When you think about the  administration, what they've  articulated in terms of  policies, we've walked backer  the tariffs, this and that. Trump out there saying that  rates are far too high. >> too high. >> that's what i heard. Not too high. >> right. But we are in a different place  in terms of -- if we were  worried about inflation  remaining out there, the fed is  on a cutting path. They may be paused for awhile,  but we know that the next move  is most likely a cut by the fed, so, is that different -- it's a  different prism from which to  look at this move in rates, no  karen? >> i don't think. >> are you concerned about this? >> i am concerned. I think the fed, what are we at  now, two cuts, most likely? >> yeah. >> 1 1/2. >> and i was going to say, they  don't seem to be so committed to that, so -- but get to your  point, is it inflation for the  good reasons or not? i think one of the things that  we don't have a good handle on  yet is productivity gains. That can help. That could be the sort of, i  don't want to say magic bullet,  but that could help, although i  am concerned, we talk about it  all the time, about this  potential tail risk of a  terrible auction and getting  into a crisis. >> don't you have a powell put  again? if things get worse, don't you  have the ability to cut rates in a more aggressive fashion? >> if we get unemployment --  >> inflation comes from two  things right now, it's energy  and shelter costs, and the  shelter costs seems like a  cyclical battle, because you  need rates to come down for  shelter costs to come down, but  energy, i think, will come down. So, that would be half of it. >> i think it's services. The ism is what has people  worried. If you think about the prints  that we've been getting, you  listen to companies, it's not  that there's a scarcity of jobs, the wages and those dynamics, we have a big payroll number on  friday. I think wages are going to be  flat, coming in at 0.3% or  something. But i do think that this is the  pa",

        "This comes after michael barr  announced he will step down next month, which could lead to more  gains ahead for the sector. According to several analysts  including our next guest. Joining us now is senior north  america bank analyst of b of a  security ebrahim poonawala. Great to have you on. What does the changing of the  guard at a time when investors  are already eager to see  deregulation in financials take  place mean? >> morgan, thank you for having  me. So i think the announcement that you saw, i think what you're  referring to is fed chair  michael barr stepping down. I think it is essentially the  start of what we have been  expecting over the last few  months that we're getting into  15-year change in the regime for the u.s. Banks, the largest u.s. Banks and what this means is  more predictable regulatory  environment, more balanced  regulatory environment. You saw the announcement  yesterday and i think as we get  into a period where the trump  appointees take office, we start hearing the messaging from the  fed that should indicate things  that i mentioned.  >> ebrahim, the -- the kre  regional bank index got up to  69, now back to around 60,  rebounding loan demand you said  should help smaller and midsized banks. Are those regionals the ones  that investors should be  thinking about there and do you  expect that to have a positive  impact rebounding loan demand on the kre? >> yes, i think two pieces to  it. The first piece is a pickup in  capital markets, goldman sachs,  jpmorgan and others who benefit  from that. And as we move through the year, the bigger sort of bang for your buck from pickup and loan demand if the trump agenda leads to a  pickup in the u.s. Domestic  capex, you see more of that in  the regional banks that are more lending heavy. >> we're already starting to see this uptick in m&a activity. An expectation at some point  we're going to perhaps finally  see this ipo pipeline begin to  burst forth and yield more  activity on that front too. How much does that matter to the banks and if so, who is best  positioned for it? >> so, it matters a lot. I think if you think about the  largest banks, all of them have  big wall street capital market  presence. The pure play name in our view  is goldman sachs. The stock has done extremely  well, but if m&a and ipo  activity show momentum as we  move through the year, we don't  think any institution large or  small better positioned than  goldman sachs to benefit from  that. On top of that, i think goldman  is at the heart of the  regulatory relief that we expect for the sector as well. So you get a dual play between  capital market pickup and  relief. >> how concerned should bank  investors be about the degree to which working class americans  are credit stretched right now? >> so, i think it is a tale of  two cities. Inflation has hurt in an  outsized way the lower income,  lower credit score consumer and  that goes at the heart of  whether or not inflation is  under control. If inflation doesn't -- to me,  the pressure on the consumer  will remain if inflation doesn't come under control or we see  resurgence, it is going to  manifest itself in the higher  treasury yield environment which could be negative if we get a  rate shock",

        "The stock. It fell more than 50% in 2024. The company warned of revenue  declines in 25. Joining us from ces is jennifer  witz with julia boorstin. Julia? >> jon, thanks so much. Thank you for joining us here at ces on the heels of your keynote interview. With so much technology around  us, such a big emphasis on a.i., how are you thinking about  deploying technology, especially as you work to address that  decline in your stock, a decline which only hastened on the heels of your updated guidance for  this year? >> thank you for having me. A.i. Is fundamental as a  technology to support our  overall value propositions. That's based on human creation  of content. So, we're going to lean into  what we're really good at, audio first, focused on our position  in the car, where we have always had a strong foot hold and we'll continue to look for a.i. To  support that human curation with improvements in discovery,  personalization, 360 and  satellite and streaming  delivered and to drive  efficiencies across the  business. So, more efficient and  streamlined personalized  marketing and also better  customer service. And i think there will be real  opportunities for us to address  the cost structure leveraging  a.i.  >> now, 20% of your overall  revenue comes from advertising. We have been talking a lot about advertising today on the heels  of meta announcing that it is  going to be replacing third  party moderation with sort of  the self-policing of its users,  making comments on the content  on the platform. You -- your business is that of  premium content. You're here in ces meeting with  a ton of advertisers. What is your response to meta's  move and how do you think  advertisers will respond? >> we have a great position. As you mentioned, we're all  about premium content, whether  it is the sirius xm service or  pandora or broader podcast  network, we're very curated in  terms of the content we provide  and we offer brands, a lot of  solutions to make sure they're  advertising against the content  that makes sense for them. And that's not just brand  safety, but brand suitability as well. It is about the nature of the  content we have and providing  advertisers with even more  solutions on targeting and  measurement to make sure that  audio is part of their buying  portfolio. And those are the conversations  we're having here, we're meeting with a lot of advertisers over  the next few days and there is  real opportunity in our  business. 20% of revenue and with a great  podcast network we have, whether it is prime junkie or conan  o'brien or smartless or call her daddy, we have a powerful  portfolio to offer advertisers.  >> it is jon fortt. You hinted at some of it. But you're backing away from  streaming, doubling down on in  car where you get a lot of  revenue per user and high  loyalty and you talked about  extending the value of that  customer, that relationship. How do you do it? where does that volume of  revenue come from to actually  move the needle, raise the  percentage? is it more in that podcast  business? is there something even more  tactical and higher value you  can do with data and targeting  the advertising? >> i think there is two things. We're not backing away from  streaming. It is critical to the future of  our business. It shows up in the fact we  leverage our streaming platform  to launch across tesla and  rivians that are on the road  already with an over the year  update. It is important to our customers to listen outside of the car. But where we're doubling down is on the car because 90% of our  subscribers are engaging with us through that embedded radio in  the car and because of that  really strong foot hold we have  in the car, we can leverage the  ad business to create new ad  supported services, with sirius  xm in the car, not only to  attract more price sensitive  customers, but also to offer  advertisers solutions and what  is the last frontier for digital ad supported advertising. So there is not a lot of  targeting opportunities in car  and we have this great  opportunity with our 360  platform to provide that for  advertisers. >> jennifer, it is morgan, great to have you on the show. I want to dig in deeper on the  podcast piece of this. You've been spending a lot of  money on podcasts. A couple of seven figure or nine figure deals like call her daddy and smartless. How are you thinking about  return on investment around that podcasting strategy? how does this landscape continue to evolve as you do counter  spotify? >> we're really excited about  the podcast talent we're working with and we look at it from an  all ad business and we're really well positioned to, you know,  bundle that with our streaming  music properties, pandora, sound cloud and others as well as  sirius xm. So there is a real opportunity  for us in advertising. I think podcasting clearly is a  big piece of that. And it represents, you know,  pandora is 60% of our ad revenue and podcasting is growing  significantly and there is more  tech solutions we can bring  there to continue to grow that. We also have an opportunity to  provide exclusive content to our sirius xm subscribers. For instance, wi",

        ">> AND NVIDIA'S CEO JENSEN HUANG IS HOLDING A Q&A WITH ANALYSTS  RIGHT NOW AT CES. WE'LL BRING YOU THE HEADLINES AS WE GET THEM.  >> FIRST TO THE MARKETS AND THIS PULLBACK. JOINING US IS CHIEF INVESTMENT  OFFICER KARA MURRAY AND ADAM  CRISTOFULLI. LAST YEAR'S WINNERS DID  RELATIVELY POORLY TODAY. LOSERS DID WELL. YOU POINT OUT THE TOP TEN STOCKS IN THE S&P 500, 2%, ARE 36% OF  THE MARKET CAP. THIS BALANCES OUT, AND YOU  EXPECT THAT THE MARKET TO DO  DOMESTIC MARKET TO DO WELL, IT  COULD BE BECAUSE THE OTHER 98%  RISE IN VALUATION OR BECAUSE  THOSE TEN FALL? WHICH DO YOU THINK IS MORE  LIKELY? >> I THINK IT IS MORE LIKELY  THAT WE START TO SEE SOME OF THE OTHERS SHARE THE SPOTLIGHT, AS  WE LOOK FOR -- YOU MENTIONED THE LARGEST NAMES IN THE S&P 500 ARE MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE MARKET  CAP OF THE S&P 500. THAT IS 10 PERCENTAGE POINTS  HIGHER THAN WHERE WE PEAKED IN  2000. YOU CAN ARGUE THAT A LOT OF THAT HAS BEEN DRIVEN ON FORWARD  EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS. FINE. BUT THERE IS A LOT OF  ANTICIPATION THAT IS BUILT INTO  THOSE NUMBERS THAT IS REFLECTED  IN THE HIGH VALUATIONS. IF YOU ROLL FORWARD FOUR  QUARTERS, WHAT YOU START TO SEE  IS EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE S&P  STARTS TO HAVE EARNINGS GROWTH  THAT ACTUALLY COMES CLOSER TO  WHAT THE TOP TENS ARE SEEING. SO I THINK WHAT HAPPENS THAT THE MARKET ATTENTION STARTS TO SHIFT TO THE REST OF THE S&P 500 AND  THEY BEGIN TO GET CREDIT FOR  THOSE CLIMBING EARNINGS. >> INTERESTING. OKAY, SO, ADAM WE SAW HIGHER  TREASURY YIELDS AGAIN TODAY. WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THAT  YOU'RE SEEING IN STOCKS AND  WHICH ONES? >> THAT'S REALLY KIND OF THE  DOMINANT MACRO THEME AND WAS  LAST YEAR, DOMINATING THE  CONVERSATION IN 2025. I THINK A VARIETY OF FACTORS ARE CAUSING IT. ONE IS HEALTHY GROWTH, YOU SAW  THAT IN SOME ECONOMIC DATA. A SLOW DOWN, DISINFLATIONARY  PROCESS AND YOU ALSO SAW THAT IN THE ISM AND BIG JUMP IN THE  PRICES COMPONENT OF THAT, UP TO  MORE THAN A YEAR. YOU HAVE SOME EVIDENCE THAT  INFLATION -- THE DISINFLATIONARY PROCESS WILL BE STALLING. AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THE  FISCAL DIMENSION TO IT AS WELL  WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF TALK  FROM WASHINGTON ABOUT THIS  MASSIVE RECONCILIATION BILL,  WILL INCLUDE A LOT OF TAX CUTS,  ALREADY ON A VERY SUSTAINABLE  FISCAL TRAJECTORY IN WASHINGTON  AND THIS BILL COULD ADD TO THAT. SO, NOT ALL OF THOSE ARE  NEGATIVE. IF IT IS ALL JUST GROWTH THAT IS DRIVING YIELDS HIGHER, STOCKS  CAN WITHSTAND THAT. IF IT IS INFLATION, MORE FISCAL  POLICY, THAT'S WHERE THE ENTIRE  MARKET IS GOING TO START TO  REALLY CRACK. THE PRICE ACTION TODAY WAS UGLY, BUT BENEATH THE SURFACE, THE  EQUAL WEIGHT DIDN'T GET HIT ALL  THAT HARD. AND IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS MORE  OF A ROTATION TRADE THAN  OUTRIGHT EXODUS FROM STOCKS. I THINK INVESTORS ARE TRYING TO  DECIPHER WHAT PRECISELY IS  CAUSING THE MAJORITY OF THE MOVE UP IN YIELDS. GROWTH, INFLATION, FISCAL  POLICY.  >> YEAH, LOTS TO DIGEST THERE. KARA, CERTAINLY SOME OF THE HIGH FLYERS OF 2024 THEY'RE SELLING  OFF THE MOST NOW INTO THE  BEGINNING OF 2025, SIGNALS TO A  CERTAIN EXTENT SOME TAX CALLING  AS WELL, TAX MOVEMENTS BY  INVESTORS I WOULD IMAGINE DOING  PROFIT TAKING IN THE NEW  CALENDAR YEAR. GIVEN THE FACT WE HAD THIS  HAWKISH MACRO DATA, THIS UPWARD  PRESSURE ON BONDS, ON THE  DOLLAR, YOU HAVE A NEW  ADMINISTRATION COMING IN, IN  ABOUT A WEEK, WEEK AND A HALF,  WHERE DO YOU PUT YOUR MONEY TO  WORK LOOKING ACROSS THE STOCK  MARKET? IS IT STILL THE MEGACAP TECH  NAMES THAT HAVE LED THE WAY FOR  THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS OR TO  YOUR POINT WHERE YOU'RE TALKING  ABOUT BROADENING OUT EARLIER, IS IT STILL S&P OR IS IT SMALLER  CAP NAMES AND MIDCAP NAMES AND  SOME OF THE LESS LOVED PARTS OF  THE MARKET? >> THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE IS A  LOT TO CHOOSE FROM IN THE LESS  LOVED AREA OF THE MARKET. THERE IS A LOT THAT HASN'T BEEN  LOVED. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE BIGGEST  OPPORTUNITY GOING FORWARD, WE  SEE MIDCAPS AS AN AREA THAT IS  REALLY RIPE FOR PICKINGS. YOU HAVE THE PERCENTAGE OF  MARKET CAP OF THE MIDCAP INDEX  RELATIVE TO THE RUSSELL 1,000 IS AT THE LOWEST ITS BEEN SINCE THE 1960s. YOU'RE GOING TO START TO SEE  EARNINGS RECOVERY IN THE LATTER  PART OF THE YEAR.

        "Towards free expression for  meta. We'll see whether these  trade-offs are worth it and  whether meta's advertisers  agree. >> yeah. And that's exactly what we're  going to talk about with our  next guest. Meta finished lower by 2%. For more on meta's decision,  let's bring in mark mahaney. Mark, it is great to have you  back on the program. Let's start right there. This decision to end fact  checking, to basically crowd  source and move to a community  notes model, what do you think  the business impact is going to  be on the stock, from an  advertiser standpoint and from  an internal spending one? >> okay, so, i don't think it is going to be material on either  of those points. Advertisers used meta because of its massive reach, the frequency with which people engage on  meta, instagram and facebook,  jon referred to over two hours a day, and then the tools, the  ability to do targeting there,  to monitor your campaign,  ability to track your return on  rollouts, that's been as good or better than anything else there  on the internet. So that's why you've seen  despite its massive scale meta  be able to grow its ad business  faster than competitors. So i don't think this changes  really at all the appeal of meta as a platform for marketers. I nk this company is running  at such a scale, revenue 40%  plus operating margins. I don't think the compliance  costs were that material to the  pnl. I see it as a financial  nonissue.  >> okay. Let me know what your price  target is, $700 a share. Higher than what i stated  before. In light of this, and it is  talked about in the blog post,  you mention it in your notes as  well, the fact that zuckerberg  gave a speech at georgetown five years ago talking about this,  why has it taken so long to  implement it, especially given  the fact he had correspondence  last summer. There has been a dynamic here  for a while. >> yeah. I like the fact that zuckerberg  referred to his georgetown  speech. I remember that speech. I wrote about it in a book i  wrote, i wrote about the speech, it got enormous amount of  pressure prior to covid,  enormous amount of pressure  related to the content and some  of it is terrible that is on  facebook and the question was,  you know, how do you -- what is  the best way to address that. And i think he's always been the school that sunshine is the best elixir or --  >> disinfectant.  >> that's the word, thank you. And i think he's going back to  that. It is very hard to fact check. I think community notes is an  interesting idea. We'll have more bad content on  there because it reflects .1% of users on meta put up  disreputable content, however  you want to define that, that's  a lot of content, given the size of the platform. Seems like he's doing his best  to try to -- what is a difficult situation. You need a lot of adults in the  room and i'll give him credit. I think they have adults in ",

        "Pressure on the market. The ten-year hitting its highest level since late april. Our next guest digging into the  charts to see how much more pain the bond market could inflict on stocks. Renaissance macro research  chairman jeff degraaf joins us  now. That's the main culprit, the  backup in yields in the 10, 30,  almost all along the curve? >> i do. I think it's important and  you're seeing it in those areas  that are most sensitive to  rates. The two exceptions being banks,  but i think that's a  deregulation story. And utilities, which i think is  a little bit of an ai story. But other than those two  one-offs, our sensitivity work  that looks at what gets most  impacted by rates and one  deviation move in rates is  pretty consistent.  >> it's obvious the kinds of  sectors, i suppose, that you  would look at, utilities, reads, and things that are proxies for  yields. But how deep does this end up  going, do you think, if rates  remain either this elevated or  back up even further? >> that's the billion dollar  question right now.  >> why i'm asking you.  >> of course. We have to get through 475,  that's a pretty important  number. We're right there, so that's an  important number for nominal  yields. I think one of the things to  watch right here -- and this is  good news, actually, is we're  not seeing these higher nominal  yields push their way into  credit spreads. So if we look at bb versus bbb  spreads, they're still very  close to the cycle lows. If we look at corporate spreads  versus the treasury, those are  also very close to the cycle  lows. What that says, sooner or later  that's going to -- higher  nominal yields will start to hit aggregate demand and that then  starts to slow things down and  you start to see those spreads  widen. That's not happening yet, but i  do think that the elevated risks of a policy mistakes are  certainly in play. Probably the highest we've seen, if not for the cycle, at least  for the last six or so months  since the fed first cut rates  back in september. So i think we're right there and i think the market is telling us that it's teetering on this  differential, if you will, in  terms of valuation and earnings  yield, and what you're able to  get from the treasury, with  obviously substantially less  risk.  >> tech is getting destroyed  today. Nasdaq is down 440, as i asked  you that question. 2.25%. Many of the biggest names,  obviously we led the show with  nvidia hitting this record high, crossing apple for the largest  market cap company in the world. Now down more than 6%. Where is this trade going from  here, according to the charts? >> well, nvidia is really the  standout for semis, right? when we look at semis -- and  we've been more utious on  semis for at least a quarter  now, nvidia kind of being the  exception to that rule. Lets still enough trend, there's a ton of support down around  $125, so that's good news. When we look at semiconductors,  you know, holistically,  everything from qualcomm to  intel to nvidia, the group is  not that strong. So i think there is a cyclical  component to it. They're as overvalued as they  were in our work back in 2000,  then nvidia barely existed. It was more the qualcomms and  intels of the world. Just a reminder to viewers that  technology is cyclical. There are new winners and new  losers in every cycle. I do think what we're seeing in  technology, i think  semiconductors are one of the  more vulnerable spaces. We're focusing our efforts and  suggesting to our clients to  remain in software and to look  at adding to exposure there. They look better.  >> do you think the market in  any way is onto, if you will,  what's about to happen over the  next handful of months and the  volatility that could happen as  a result of the new  administration coming in, new  policies that he wants to get  done quickly, tariffs that could happen sooner than people may be willing to believe or the size  of which, the scope of which,  the strength of which could be a little more unsettling, what the talk of tax cuts could mean for  rates going up further? do you think the market is on to that? as positive as the outlook still feels like it is, i'm not saying the trend is all of a sudden  going to reverse itself, but the market seems to be on to  something.  >> look, i make my living by  believing that, right? i believe that the market is a  discounting mechanism that it  might not be obvious to us today what the market is pricing in  for next month or even next  year. But the market is omnipotent in  its wisdom. I think there's something there. The good news is, we look at  what we call the policy  uncertainty index, we use it out of stanford, the baker bloom and uncertainty index. What's refreshing, when you look at policy and certainty, when  this is spiking, so uncertainty  is high, when we look at that  out three, six months, it's  actually very bullish for the  markets. In other words, by the time  uncertainty hits us today and we can kind of quantitatively  analyze it, it's too late to do  anything about it and you  actually want to be an investor  in those high uncertain times,  because usually it ends up  ameliorating itself. We did start the year off from  an oversold condition, so that's good. It's not a deep oversold  condition. So i like that. I actually think probably the  biggest impediment to equities  for 2025 is just this wall of  worry that's been extinguished  over the last year. We started 2024 with a lot of  skeptics, a lot of skepticism in the market. We were bullish for 2024. We're starting 2025 not in that  same mental state. I think that expectation game is probably going to keep u",

        "COMPANIES THAT RAISED MEGA  FUNDING ROUNDS LATE LAST YEAR.  >> BIG MONEY. THANK YOU.  >>> LET'S BRING IN RASHAUN  WILLIAMS. WELCOME BACK. NICE TO SEE YOU AND HAPPY NEW  YEAR.  >> HAPPY NEW YEAR. GOOD TO SEE YOU.  >> SO THERE WAS A LOT OF  OPTIMISM, OBVIOUSLY, COMING INTO 2025, ABOUT A REBIRTH OF IPOs,  ANIMAL SPIRITS AND ALL OF THAT,  WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT SEVERAL  TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF '24. DO YOU THINK THAT WAS UNFOUNDED  OPTIMISM? >> YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK SO. THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT HAVE TO GO RIGHT FOR THE TECH IPO  SPACE TO OPEN BACK UP. ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE TO  ALIGN PERFECTLY. AND, UNFORTUNATELY, THEY DIDN'T. SO WE STILL HAVE TO HOLD ONTO IT BECAUSE SO MUCH IS RIDING ON IT. ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THE  SECONDARY MARKET, WHICH WAS A  STEPCHILD TO PRIMARY MARKET  LIQUIDITY EVENTS A FEW YEARS AGO IS CREATING LIQUIDITY FOR  FOUNDERS AND EMPLOYEES AND  THERE'S SO MUCH FUNDING, GUYS  HAVE A WAR CHEST OF CAPITAL TO  LAST THROUGH THE DOWNTURN ON THE TECH IPO SIDE.  >> WHAT'S THE MOST INTERESTING  THING TO YOU RIGHT NOW IN YOUR  WORLD OF -- THE CAPITAL YOU HAVE AND WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO  DEPLOY IT, WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE  MOST INTERESTING THING TO YOU  THESE DAYS? >> I'VE NEVER FELT MORE POPULAR  AT AN ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT  MANAGER THAN THE LAST 12 MONTHS. I WAS LISTENING TO SOME OF THE  OTHER FOLKS ON YOUR SHOW AND  EVERYONE IS ALLOCATING  ALTERNATIVES AS A CORE PART OF  PORTFOLIOS NOW. AND WE'VE BEEN PLAYING THAT DRUM FOR A LONG TIME. THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT  EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT IN MY  WORLD. YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT IT WITH  LATE-STAGE AI COMPANIES. LATE-STAGE TECH, SPECIFICALLY AI AND CYBER, DRIVING ACTIVITY IN  MY PERSONAL PORTFOLIO AND IN OUR FUNDS. AND THEN SPORTS TEAMS. YOU ALREADY KNOW, IT'S A  NON-CORRELATED OR LOW CORRELATED ASSET CLASS, TRADING AT MULTIPLE LEVELS, JUST LIKE SOFTWARE  COMPANIES FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO. THEY'RE GENERATING THE MOST  INTEREST WITH INVESTMENT  ADVISERS AND RETAIL INVESTORS  THAT I'M SEEING IN SEVERAL  YEARS.  >> YOU'RE IN LP WITH THE  FALCONS, LET'S GET THAT OUT  THERE. WE'VE MENTIONED IT MANY TIMES,  BUT JUST SO PEOPLE REMEMBER YOUR PULLOVER, NOTWITHSTANDING, YOUR  QUARTER ZIP THAT I NOTICED, YOU  HAVE THE LOGO ON YET AGAIN. BUT DO YOU SEE AN ENDLESS RUNWAY FOR VALUATIONS IN SPORTS? AND DO YOU THINK AT SOME POINT  IT GETS INTO BUBBLE-LIKE  TERRITORY? HOW DO YOU VIEW IT WHEN NOW  SEEMINGLY, AS YOU JUST  REFERENCED YOURSELF, EVERYBODY  IS TALKING ABOUT IT? >> YEAH, THIS IS THE SAME  CONVERSATION I HAD EIGHT YEARS  AGO ABOUT LATE-STAGE TECH. REMEMBER WHEN THERE WERE ONLY  FOUR COMPANIES THAT WERE VALUED  AT OVER A BILLION DOLLARS AND  THEY WERE PROFITABLE AND  EVERYONE CALLED IT A BUBBLE? NOW WE HAVE TRILLION DOLLAR  COMPANIES AND OVER 100 COMPANIES THAT ARE VALUED AT OVER A  BILLION. WE'RE IN THAT SPACE WITH SPORTS  FRANCHISES. WHAT'S THE KEY TO THIS EQUATION  IS NOT THE VALUATIONS, IT'S  GOING TO SOUND CRAZY. IT'S REVENUE. REVENUE IS DRIVING VALUATIONS. THE MULTIPLES ARE STAYING THE  SAME. ALL THE REVENUE IS COMING FROM  NATIONAL MEDIA RIGHTS. SO THE STREAMERS AND THE MEDIA  COMPANIES ARE ALL PAYING THESE  SPORTS TEAMS, BECAUSE THE TOP 80 TO 90 OF THE TELEVISION  BROADCASTS ARE ALL LIVE SPORTS  EVENTS AND POLITICS. SO IT'S DRIVING ALL OF THE  VIEWERSHIP, WHICH IS DRIVING  THESE BIG MEGA DEALS, LIKE YOU  SAW WITH THE NBA, INCREASING  REVENUE. AND THESE ARE TEN-YEAR DEALS. IF I'M AN INVESTOR LOOKING AT A  STREAM OF CASH FLOW WITH A TIER  1 CREDITOR THAT IS NOT  CORRELATED TO THE STOCK MARKET  AND IS KIND OF EXCITING, I WANT  TO HAVE MY ASSETS IN SOME KIND  OF BASKETBALL OR FOOTBALL CLUB  IF I CAN. IF YOU WANT TO RIDE THE WAVE OF  AI AND GET ACCESS TO THE NEXT  GENERATION OF COMPANIES THAT ARE PRIVATE, GOING PUBLIC, YOU WANT  TO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE PRIVATE AI COMPANIES. BUT THE MULTIPLES ARE STABLE. >> IT'S SUCH A BRAVE NEW WORLD  WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. NOW PRIVATE EQUITY HAS ACCESS TO THE NFL IN A WAY IT NEVER DID. NOW WE'RE HEARING ABOUT, AS WE  WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT WITH ONE OF OUR GUESTS PRIOR, THE  OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN COLLEGE TEAMS AND PROGRAMS, WHICH NEVER  EXISTED BEFORE. AND EXPECTING SOME SORT OF  RETURN FROM THAT. IS THAT ATTRACTIVE TO YOU? >> NOT ME SPECIFICALLY, BUT IT  IS TO CERTAIN INVESTORS. I PREFER BOND-LIKE RISK AND  PRIVATE EQUITY-LIKE RETURNS. I CONSIDER THE COLLEGE FRONTIER  AS MORE EMERGING GROWTH STAGE OR EARLY STAGE. I LIKE THE SOPHISTICATED  LEAGUES, THE DOMINANT MONOPOLIES AND NOT THE AREAS THAT ARE ON  THE FRINGE, RIGHT? BUT IF YOU ARE A SOPHISTICATED  INVESTOR AND YOU CAN LOOK AT A  STREAM OF CASH FLOW AND YOU CAN  LOOK AT THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE CREDITORS OF THAT STREAM OF  CASH FLOW, AND YOU CAN  UNDERWRITE, I THINK IT'S A HUGE  PLAY OR A QUASI CAPITAL  STRUCTURE ON THE MEDIA COMPANIES WHO ARE PAYING THE MEDIA RIGHTS.

        "Downgrade.  >> $188, the new price target. Steve, thank you. Let's bring in liz young thomas  now to talk about this. Interesting price action. Certainly in these stocks. But also in tech, which was such a winner a day ago. Now such a loser today. >> yeah, so if we rewind to the  day after the election and look  at the tech sector broadly, 81%  of the names were trading above  their 200-day moving average. Today that's at 41%. There's been a serious  deterioration in the number of  names trading above that  average. But the sector itself is up 0.6% over that period. What does that tell you? it tells you that concentration  has returned, the average stock  and some of the internals are  weaker, but concentration is  here. That makes the rally more  fragile. So there are a few things that  you can think about. There's also the idea that  overbought territory, so 4% of  tech is in overbought territory. The only other sector is  consumer discretionary. It tells you that you could  actually still get a better  entry point into some of these  tech stocks. Then the question becomes, do we want to buy them? is this the beginning of  something a little more  sinister, or is this somewhat of a buying opportunity? >> what do you think it is? more the former or latter? there's nothing to suggest that  this is the former, something  more sinister. Jensen huang, it's not like he  said anything was wrong. He underscored why things are  great.  >> i think this is a pause in  sentiment and i think it should  be a pause in sentiment. If you look at yields, the  ten-year yield has risen  considerably over the last few  weeks and the yield curve has  steepened. The rational response is that  growth stocks should pull back  as yields go up. That's not what happened  yesterday, but that is what's  happening today. That's not what happened for  certain periods of 2024, but i  think in 2025 that will be the  norm. You have to rationalize the  valuations with where yields  are, especially with the  ten-year above 4.5%.  >> i just think that the trend  is still positive, people think, the narrative is still  overwhelmingly positive because  of the new administration coming tax cuts and everything else  we've talked about a thousand  times already. So that higher rates aren't  necessarily going to be such a  binary impact on tech. While rates go up, tech goes  down, it doesn't necessarily  work that way. And it certainly doesn't appear  to work that way anymore. You are just going to the  benefit of the doubt stocks, if  you will, in any period of  uncertainty. Vix goes up 8%, north of 17, but you just go to the tried and  true stocks in any period of  uncertainty. I don't know that that  relationship between rates and  tech really matters as much  anymore.  >> so what i think -- where i  think it does matter, what we're giving back is some of the  multiple expansion that's  occurred over the last year or  two years, in especially the  bigger names. And that's the part that is the  most fragile, especially in a  yield environment like this. So what we've seen is the yield  curve has steepened for six  straight weeks in a row. Over that same period, the s&p  is actually down 1.5%. So we've given back some of the  froth, some of those really  expanded valuations, and the  performance of the s&p, although broadly down 1.5%, cyclicles  have outperformed defensives,  which is, again, something that  should rationally happen,  especially if our expectation  for 2025 is that we'll have this pro growth, pro cyclical  environment. It's not to say that tech is  suddenly going to fall out of  bed. It's that there's probably  opportunity in a yield  environment like this for other  sectors to do better. So tech --  >> even in a yield environment  like this where yields are  elevated? i would suggest that that's not  going to happen. If yields continue to rise, how  is the broadening of the market  going to happen? >> it depends why they're  rising. If they're rising because we're  engaging in some really  detrimental trade wars that are  limiting supply, that are going  to limit demand, they're going  to limit investment for  businesses, then equities  probably feel the pain. If they're rising because demand is still strong and maybe we've  got sticky inflation but  inflation that's not necessarily out of control, then you've got  pro growth, pro cyclical, growth can stay stable as well and  investors start to look for  valuation opportunities in  places outside of tech that  aren't at all-time highs.  >> what if they're rising on the expectation of a more  inflationary policy stream  coming out of d.c.? even if you're going to have  better than expected growth, but you're still going to have the  potential of more inflationary  policies, like inflating the  deaf fit  deficit even further? >> it keeps the lid on the  return potential, we're not  going to have another 25% year  in that case. But it still allows some of the  other sectors to look more  attractive. For example, what's happening  today, yields did strike in  response to that ism services  prices paid component. >> almost 5% on the 30-year, by  the way.  >> right, which that's a big  move and it was a big move in  the ten-year, too. So yields spiking on that  expectation is an inflationary  response, the expectation for  fed cuts went down quite a bit  afterwards, but still the main  pain in the market is in tech. Because that's where the  discount rate hurts the most. As the discount rate stays  elevated, it hurts growth  stocks. If this is, again, a pro growth, pro cyclical environment, if  you're worried about valua",

regulations will have on the [Music] industry welcome to cnbc's crypto world I'm Katie tasv crypto markets falling this morning shedding yesterday's gains as of noon Eastern Bitcoin fell back below the 100K level to 97 ,000 ether dropped nearly 7% to $ 3457 and salana sank 6% to $27 okay let's talk about the top stories cftc chair Roston Benham announced he's stepping down from the agency his last day as chairman will be January 20th inauguration day and he will leave the agency entirely in early February as the agency's head Benham embraced both Bitcoin and ether as Commodities sometimes clashing with SEC chair Gary Gensler who's standing on eth has been more ambiguous Gensler will also step down from his role on inauguration day the cftc took legal actions against a number of crypto firms under vom's leadership including FTX and binance benom said he would work closely with president-elect Trump's team to ensure a smooth transition next sticking with the cftc crypto exchange Gemini reached a settlement in its legal battle with the regulator The Firm which was founded by the winlos twins will pay the agency $5 million back in May for an related matter the company returned nearly $2.2 billion to users of its defunct crypto lending program the cftc sued Gemini in June of 2022 accusing it of making false or misleading statements to the agency regarding a Futures product certification back in 2017 all right let's turn to M for our main story the European Union's markets in crypto assets regulation went into full effect at the end of 20124 and crypto world's TAA mckel spoke with Sid Powell of maple to find out what impact the rules have on the crypto industry She also asked him what the rules mean for tether after the stablecoin faced delisting for coinbase's European customers MAA the markets and crypto assets regulation went into full effect in December after a staggered roll out so just to set the scene for people who are unaware what do these new rules mean for crypto businesses and users in the region yeah good question T So Meer is the market structure bill for Europe so what this aims to do is set out rules for the is issuance of tokens as well as uh the provision of crypto Services I think trading savings accounts um uh margin Services derivatives for any institutions or any startups who wish to operate in Europe so it's quite a big piece of legislation one of the big uh questions for this regulation was or is about how it's going to affect assets already trading in the the region so on the stable coin side we saw you know coinbase take the step of removing tether for its European customers due to M concerns so how big of an impact is that for tether um and is that a benefit for some of the other stable coins operating in the region that haven't faced similar questions it's a very good question uh stable coins are a big Focus uh in the world of crypto at the moment coinbase of course has a vested interest given that they have uh share of the economics of usdc but I think overall when you take a step back and look at tether they have over 140 billion in outstanding um market cap and so this was less than 3% of issuance so I think um this is a short-term setback for tether but around the world they still have a very strong um position as the leader in stable coins and they have very strong Network effects particularly in Asia where most of the trading volume occurs but I think no doubt this was a win for Circle and for coinbase with respect to usdc um what how would you characterize the significance of stable coins around the world right now and this year um you know given that we did see so many stable coin launches or announcements toward the end of the year in 2024 and historically stable coins you know they're a trading story they're a measure of Market liquidity and they hisor been used most trading and and we know well that there are other use cases beyond the trading so what is sort of the story of stable coins that you see happening in 2025 I think a really good question so we saw a Flur of launches of new stable coins so Ripple entered the market there was talk of revolute entering the market PayPal of course entered the market last year but what we've seen is the evolution of stable coins moving from just a trading currency to a store value particularly in Emerging Markets which I think tether um has done a good job of penetrating so people in Emerging Markets want to preserve their purchasing power um which is generally eroded by holding local currencies that are inflated away uh the second element is payment processing and I think this was really what attracted PayPal to the stable coin Market is the idea that they could um instead of needing to use banking networks or the Visa Network that they could instead just use their own stable coin and cut out a lot of costs there so we've seen the evolution and the maturation of stable coins as a product from just a trading pair to payment processing and store of value and we're seeing increasing interest now from traditional players who see that they might lose Revenue I think this was a big driver behind uh visas focus on stable coins and then looking at the us if I can for a second uh obviously the regulatory environment has changed drastically in the past few months people are a lot more optimistic about ruem here is maik the blueprint for the us and do you expect lawmakers to follow a similar path I think lawmakers are currently on a similar path we had uh the fit Bill uh last year which passed in the lower house but did not pass in the upper house so people are looking and speculating as to whether the US will see a market structure Bill whether that's fit or something else um but uh my concern as an operator and a builder in the space would be that the US goes too far in terms of setting in place rigid rules which would increase the cost for startups and therefore decrease Innovation because I think overall the North Star for um the incoming Administration is to Foster uh Innovation and ensure that the US is number one in the blockchain and crypto space so I think we're seeing overall a move towards something more like what Europe has in place but I would hope that they tread carefully in terms of not putting in place rules that are too rigid or make it too costly to set up a startup which of course has been the story for startups over the last 20 years uh in the European Union yeah definitely going to be a good one to watch that theme play out this year finally what does development in the crypto space look like this coming year so Maple is focused on defi for institutions do you see this crypto cycle as being about onboarding institutions and expanding adoption there rather than retail investors yeah I do see that as a huge story for the 2025 cycle so so I mean just as some indicators you know with the launch of the Bitcoin ETF or or the approvals there we saw much um much more institutional interest in participating in the space Maple is focused on tokenized private credit so we lend to institutions and what we have seen is more inquiries from institutions whether they are us-based or european-based um in terms of participating whether this is holding uh you know funds that might hold uh or issuing funds that might hold tokenized assets or on boarding private wealth clients but so I think what that means for the space is pay attention to Def which I expect to see a Resurgence um based mostly on the change in regulatory environment in the US and then I think also rwas will continue to be a trend a positive trend off the back of institutional adoption and then the other one I'm paying attention to is uh is gamey also for the same

        "Check this out, kelly. Dallas, texas, could get a foot  of snow just in time, by the  way, for the college playoff  football semifinal between ohio  state and texas. It's the cotton bowl in dallas. Now, storm aside, this new  college football playoff format  bringing millions of more  dollars for schools and new  rules allowing the players to  get their cut has changed  everything, and maybe not for  the better. A new cnbc sport video cast and  eli manning on his take of the  changing face of college sports. >> i'm a little bit worried. And i'm fine that players are  getting paid and this is a big  business. College football is making tons  of money and the players deserve to be rewarded. But just the fact that, you  know, the easy transferring and  basically each player is a free  agent twice a year and can  negotiate, i think it's -- i  feel that there's not a whole  lot of loyalty to your college,  to your coach, to your school. You're maybe not picking a  school based on it being the  best fit for you or you like the teammates or you like your  coaches or you like the campus. It's all about who maybe is  paying the most money and moving around each year to chase the  money. That's not the idea of sports. That's not the idea of college  football. >> wow. Let's bring in the man that did  that interview with eli manning, cnbc's alex sherman. I couldn't agree more. A lot of people would disagree. But it's a big interview, alex.  >> i think eli manning spoke  from a fan perspective, which is interesting, because not only  was he a high-profile college  football player once himself,  but his nephew, arch manning, is currently a college football  player, sort of going through  the process. And i asked him during that  interview if he's watching, and  he said, of course i'm watching. I'm passionate about the game,  i'm passionate about texas where his nephew was playing. But i think he speaks from a  general sentiment of concern  that many long-time fans of  college football are now kind of going through mentally, which is that they still love the game,  they still love their teams,  they're excited for an expanded  college football playoffs. But at the same time, this idea  of the constant transferring and payment of athletes, it just  rubs people the wrong way, and i think conc",

        "Yesterday, the company making an investment, buying a retailer of firearms. Thanks for joining us. You know what the critics will  say. They'll say this is just  zuckerberg cowering to trump. We can look at it that way. Or do we look at it like  zuckerberg and his companies  cowered to the biden  administration and should have  never been in this position in  the first place? >> i don't think those things  are mutually exclusive, they  could both be true. People have said for a long time that politics is downstream from culture, but i like to say that  business is downstream from  politics. So obviously this is a response  to the trump win, and he  basically admits later in the  video, something that i've been  saying to you on air for a  couple of years now, that  elements of the federal  government during the biden  administration were coercing and pressuring big tech companies,  including his own, to violate  the first amendment. And that's a huge problem. It's what inspired our fund to  be created that you alluded to,  to invest in companies that were not going to capitulate to that  level of pressure. So i think embedded in this  announcement is something even  more troubling, which was that  the previous administration was  violating our rights. >> the headline, some of the  headlines you've seen are  basically like, oh, facebook and meta, whatever you want to call  it, they're getting rid of  fact-checkers. The implication, if you just  read the headline, that there's  no more fact-checking, and thus  put whatever you will on there. No doubt, there will be some  garbage that leaks through, even under the community notes  system. But it sounds like as an  investor you don't believe this  is going to be some kind of big  negative. Maybe it's a positive for the  meta-owned companies. >> first of all, it's a huge  positive. I mean, obviously i have my  caveats that i'll offer that i  think this is definitely  opportunistic and i can  personalize why that's the case. Putting that aside for a moment, it is a net positive. It turns out that free speech is good business, and i think they  see that the american people  overwhelmingly want this. It's also the whole topic we've  discussed in the past, also,  about the challenge of legacy  media and what happened in this  presidential election, so much  of the communication with people occurred in independent media on podcasts. Whether you're a network or big  tech business, they see where  the leaves are blowing and  they're trying to go toward  where the people are and that is an embrace of constitutional  protections, free speech. But of course the question i'll  ask is whether or not this is  just opportunistic, is the  company we took public  yesterday, yes, you're right, a  gun retailer with our spac, it  sells guns. Over half of the country owns a  firearm. Right now you cannot advertise  on meta with firearms at all. It's banned. So my question is, if he's  rediscovered the constitution,  how far does that go? i think that remains to be seen. >> that's an interesting  question. It's kelly here, if i may. I'll pick up on the same theme,  two other possible things i  wonder about. Number one, and he admitted  this, there's going to be  slightly less ability for us to  catch all the bad stuff when  year having a lighter touch  about everything. They're already under pressure  about what has been going on on  instagram, sex trafficking, that kind of thing. That's one ving investors might  be squeamish about. When he says, when the american  government tries to censor us,  it emboldens other governments  to censor more. How much of a fight is he  willing to get into with other  governments about the free  speech issues, which really only apply, those legal protections  only apply to americans? >> you just picked up on i think the most important question we  have right now for the future of capitalism, it's a fight we're  having at home. It's the fact that politics has  infiltrated red and blue  america. We're one of the only countries  in the world that has a bill of  rights, and that's what i think  we really need to understand,  that if you only look at it away from that, then you're going to  have the kind of authoritarian  systems that you have in other  countries that, by the way, do  fairly well financially. China has social credit scoring, they're the second largest  economy in the world. So we need to be very careful  about totally separating those  constitutional freedoms from  economics. It's why we've incorporated so  much into what we're working on. And i think you're pointing out  that you need to have a united  states government and  administration that's in favor  of strong constitutional  protections, that empowers our  multinational businesses to do  business abroad. And it really goes full circle,  which was he irony we had where a lot of these big woke  companies would do business in  china where they have slave  labor and then lecture us about  not being progressive enough. I think that's got to stop, too. >> you know what the critics are going to say, zuckerberg is  afraid of trump. He appointed dana white of the  ufc, one of trump's biggest  friends and backers to the  board, and he's facing a  lawsuit. I think it starts in april. And this is just zuckerberg  being afraid and responding to  the incoming administration. >> hey, look, i don't have a lot of issue with that critique,  either, by the way, because, you know what, you've got to judge  people when things are hard. What did his company do when it  was hard to stand up against an  administration? he totally capitulated. You know who is vindicated here, elon musk, and what he did when  he bought x. A lot of the mainstream media  said he's going to destroy the  company and it was important  during the election. He stood up against the regime  and he's been rewarded because  now it's the most important  social media platform in the  world. And you see other things like  rumble or truth social that are  all coming around and being able to be successful because they  have the following that folks  want. I don't see -- regardless of  where you are on the political  spectrum, you should look back  at a period like 2020, 2021, and be very troubled. Like, when one of my partners  started that company parlor that was a social media app that a  few big tech companies colluded  to de-platform it, that's wrong, anti-american. I'm just very happy to see that  even big companies are starting  to realize the error of their  ways. There is an element here that  could be opportunistic that  they're simply responding to  whatever administration is in  power. So i urge customers and users to really analyze and hold their  feet to the fire, which is to  say, how are you going t",

        "LUNCH.\" THE IPO MARKET HAS BEEN ON A  LITTLE BIT OF A COMEBACK LATELY, NOTHING LIKE THE SPAC CRAZE A  FEW YEARS AGO. BUT THIS YEAR, 2025, WE COULD  SEE A BIGGER BOOST, AND PERHAPS  FROM PRIVATE EQUITY EXITS. NEARLY HALF OF THE IPOs THAT  COME DOWN THE PIKE THIS YEAR ARE EXPECTED TO COME FROM PE-BACKED  FIRMS. LESLIE PICKER IS HERE WITH MORE  ON THE STORY AND KEN SQUIRE IS  WITH US AS WELL.  >> LITERALLY A SHOVE. >> SHE DID THIS. >> SHE'S RIGHT, THOUGH. THEY'VE BEEN SITTING IN THESE  FUNDS. THESE FUNDS ARE AGING, AND THE  LONGER THEY SIT THERE, THE  BIGGER THEY GET, THE FEWER  PROSPECTIVE BUYERS. AND, BY THE WAY, THERE ARE ALL  THESE LIMITED PARTNERS AND  INVESTORS IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY  FIRMS THAT WANT THEIR MONEY BACK IN THE REALIZATIONS OF M&A OR  IPO. IPO IS BECOMING AN EVEN MORE  ATTRACTIVE OPTION. AFTER 2024 WHEN YOU SAW  OUTPERFORMANCE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IPO CLASS OF 2024, THE  EDIAN PERFORMANCE FOR THOSE  THAT WERE BACKED BY PRIVATE  EQUITY WAS ABOUT 21%. THOSE BACKED BY VENTURE CAPITAL, THE MEDIAN PERFORMANCE WAS ABOUT NEGATIVE 8%. >> WOW.  >> SO A HUGE DISPARITY. SO YOU'VE GOT THE PUBLIC MARKET  INVESTORS WHO LIKE THAT  PERFORMANCE. THEY ALSO LIKE THE  PREDICTABILITY OF THESE  COMPANIES THAT HAVE AN OPERATING HISTORY AND CREDIT SPREADS ARE  EXTREMELY TIGHT RIGHT NOW.  >> INTEREST RATES ARE STILL  HIGH.  >> INTEREST RATES ARE HIGH, BUT  THE CREDIT MARKETS ARE OPEN. AND MORE IMPORTANT FOR PRIVATE  EQUITY IS JUST A STABILIZATION  OF INTEREST RATES. AS THEY WERE GOING UP IT WAS  HARDER TO MODEL THE BUSINESSES,  ESPECIALLY DURING THE PERIOD OF  INFLATION, IT WAS HARD TO BE  ABLE TO SAY, HERE IS WHAT THE  FUTURE VALUE OF THIS COMPANY  LOOKS LIKE, AND THEREFORE THIS  IS WHAT I SHOULD PAY FOR IT OR  SELL IT FOR. NOW THAT THINGS HAVE KIND OF  STABILIZED ON THE INFLATION  FRONT, AND FINANCING IS PRETTY  WIDE OPEN AT THIS POINT IN TIME, YOU ALSO HAVE THIS BOOM IN  PRIVATE CREDIT, THAT CAPITAL IS  LOOKING TO GO SOMEWHERE, IT KIND OF OPENS THE WHOLE CYCLE. THERE'S A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE M&A GEARS TURNING  ON, THE IPO MARKETS TURNING ON,  AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO  2025.  >> EVERYONE LIKES TO ACT  TOGETHER, AS WE'RE LEARNING ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS. BUT THE IPO MARKETS HAVE BEEN  PRETTY QUIET, CONSIDERING HOW  STRONG THE STOCK MARKET WAS LAST YEAR. >> YEAH, PEOPLE THAT INVEST IN  IPOs ARE LOOKING FOR HYPER  GROWTH AND GET IN EARLY. WHEN YOU CAN INVEST IN THE MAG  SEVEN AND KIND OF GET THAT,  MAYBE IT TAKES SOME OF THE  ALLURE AWAY FROM PUTTING IT TO  AN IPO THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE  RISKIER AND NOT AS ESTABLISHED.  >> ESPECIALLY PRIVATE EQUITY DID A LOT OF SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE  AND A LOT OF THOSE BUSINESS  MODELS, YOU GO, WHAT'S GOING TO  HAPPEN WITH AI? WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE ROUND OF AI  STARTUPS AND THOSE ARE GOING TO  BE VENTURE BACKED.  >> IF YOU ARE GOING TO THE  PUBLIC MARKETS AND HAVING THESE  CONVERSATIONS ON ROAD SHOWS WITH INVESTORS, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE  TO ANSWER THE QUESTION, HOW AI  IMPACT YOUR BUSINESS, DO YOU  HAVE AN AI COMPONENT THAT WILL  MAKE YOU MORE EFFICIENT? INVESTORS WANT TO KNOW THAT  ANSWER. UNTIL YOU HAVE IT, YOU CAN'T GO  PUBLIC REGARDLESS OF THE  VALUATION.  >> COMPANIES THAT ARE SPINNING  OFF VERY SMART AND PROFITABLE  UNITS SHOULD THROW AI IN THEIR  NAME TO GET A MORE WARM WELCOME  IN SAID PUBLIC MARKETS. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M REFERRING TO.  >> YES. >> THIS VERY FINE COMPANY WILL  BE TESTING THE MARKETS THIS  YEAR. ",

        "Federal agency was compromised  in the treasury hack by the  chinese government affiliated  actors. With cybersecurity to remain a  critical issue, morgan stanley  says cyberark could benefit. Shares are up in the past year. Joining us now to discuss in an  exclusive interview, matt cohen  is the ceo of cyberark. >> good to be with you. >> i know it's tricky trying to  dance on a competitor's -- it's  not a gravestone, but there have been a historic number of  breaches against u.s.  infrastructure and targets. What are the implications for  your company? >> that's the important thing to understand what exactly has  occur and how can we help harden the industry against these type  of attacks? the competitors aren't really  other cybersecurity companies. The competitors are the bad  actors and adversaries working  formation states or cyber  criminal yndicates. When you look into this recent  hack of the treasury, you  understand when you look at the  attack factor, that it came down to exploiting a vulnerable in  software and ultimately stealing an api key, a type of machine  identity. Ultimately, we at cyberark which protects human and machine  identities is focused on  educating the market on the need to secure those machine  identities, those keys, if you  will, to make sure that these  type of attacks can't continue  to occur, because there are  vulnerable things around the  world. >> would your technology keep  this from happening? is it more about identification  and response? >> the proper implementation of  this type of technology where  you secure your machine identity or api keys would have made it  much harder for the bad actors  to get involved. This all started with a  vulnerability within the  software. The software supply chain  securing of that is critical for all of us in the cybersecurity  industry. We are obviously focused in to  make sure that this type of  attack can't happen with  cyberark. But it's our approach to  securing human and machine  identity that puts our customers in a good place as they try to  protect themselves against these attacks.  >> we have seen ports  infiltrated. Different kinds of  infrastructure systems. According to sources with the  government, it might be as china is testing what our response  would look like to a taiwan  invasion. Given the way your company  operates, do you think that you  would be able to protect a lot  of these key national assets if  you were implemented that way? >> i think that when you see  this heightened threat  environment that we are living  in, most of the adversaries,  whether nation states or cyber  criminals, are going after  identities. The identity is really the life  blood of an organization. If they can find an identity,  whether it be human or machine,  that has the right level of  privileges, then they can take  over those enterprises, take  over a government agency. Ultimately, there's a new front  of cybersecurity. It used to be about protecting  the perimeter or the end point. Now at the forefront is  protecting identity. We call that identity security. Cyberark is the leader in  identity security, has a role to play in making sure these  adversaries can't get into the  deepest part of these  organizations and get secrets  and other aspects of critical  data that we don't want to get  into the wrong hands.  >> of course. It's sew if  sophisticated. Do you use encrypted apps when  you text? it does make a person wonder. >> i think that all of us have  to take an extra layer of  security and let's say hygiene  in our approach to communication and our approach to how we  secure information and data. Ultimately, what we have to do  is make sure that the most  important assets we have,  whether us at cyberark, our  government institutions or  enterprises are following and  deploying the right  cybersecurity best practices. That starts with making sure we  lock down each identity. Make sure we have good policies  in place to take credentials out of the play of these attack  . >> sorry, we have to leave it  there.",

This could be vulnerable to  trump's fcc chair who threatened actions against a censorship  cartel. Meta's changes are what they  asked for.

It's possible that google have  donated and they are not  publicly saying so. Even that could suggest that  google isn't as willing to  publicly align itself. Alphabet also has to balance a  more progressive workforce that  supported democrats in the last  election. All of this to say, alphabet  here is facing maybe more  delicate balancing than some of  its others. Keep many mind that mark  zuckerberg has more control over his company. He is a controlling shareholder. They have different workforces.  >> wasn't trump happy with  sunder? >> he loves the attention. He recently said that maybe we  shouldn't break up google. There's maybe signs of hope that that stance is softening. It's interesting to note that as zuckerberg goes on this charm  offensive, it kind of makes the  lack of one from google more  evident.

        "Day. Craig moffett downgrading apple  to sell from hold. Giving it a 188 price target. It's at 243. That's 20% downside. Apple is a great company, but  valuations are stretched and its hand in china is weakening. The ai has not driven the  supercycle it was supposed to. We have craig with us on the  phone. Very few people get to be  phoners. Whatever you are doing, thank  you for making the time to join  us. Welcome. >> thanks. I'm glad to be here. >> this is -- when is the last  time you had a sell rating on  apple? >> this is the first time i've  had a sell rating on apple. You said in your intro, i want  to underscore, this is not a  call that says apple is a bad  committee. It's not saying apple is broken. It's a call that says that the  valuation has run too far and  that there are legitimate risks  that simply aren't being  discounted in the stock today  and that it makes sense for  people to be more cautious.  >> is it trading at an all-time  high valuation? >> yes. You are looking at apple trading right now at 33 times earnings. What i think particularly jumps  out is, remember, apple is no  longer a brisk growth company. When you think about its peer  group among the mag 7, among  amazon and meta, for example, or alphabet, the peg ratio, the  ratio of the multiple to the  growth rate is above three. All the others are around two. If you look out even a year or  two years, the valuation that is implied here starts to be  ridiculously stretched relative  to the rest of its peer group  and the rest of its peer group  is not cheap. This is not a moment when  anybody would say that the mag 7 are trading at bargain  multiples.  >> right. We were surprised when it  started to take off last year. There were five straight weeks  where it rose 2% or more on no  real news or developments that i could discern. >> yeah, that's right. Let's actually retrace a little  bit of what happened in 2024. We started last year with this  narrative that apple was behind  in ai. It lagged pretty badly during  the early part of the big ai  rally last year. As we got closer to the  worldwide developer conference  in june, the market started to  anticipate what the strategy was going to be. By and large, got it right. Loved the strategy and rightly  so. It's a capital light strategy. They have all kinds of  advantages in ai that can  schedule for you using your  calendar and contacts and email. All of those things are true. The market figured out they were coming and the market started to price them in. When we initiated coverage last  year while we really liked the  strategy and thought that apple  was really well positioned, it  looked to us to be fairly fully  valued. >> right.  >> the market started to come  back to a view that, wait a  second, apple is behind in ai. The market was a little more  sober. To be honest, during the last  part of the year it mostly  traded in line with the market  for the last part of the year. Although, over the last part of  november and december, it  started to rally strongly. As you said, what was supposedly no news, but in fact t",

        "To play that sound bite. You can react to her comment  there or what you think of  this -- these pretty big and  major moves by meta today.  >> i'm thrilled to see them is  the upshot. I think the reality is that free speech on the internet is a  critical thing to uphold. There was a period in the last  few years where for a lot of  reasons we saw a lot of content  moderation and investment in  that. The reality is doing content  moderation on a central platform is dangerous and impossible to  do well. Seeing this moment where meta is able to step back and say, look, we're going to move toward a  world where just like the post  office, like a phone, we route  messages to the people who want  to hear them. We're not in the business of  moderating is a great step.  >> do you think it's a final  step or four or eight or 12  years from now when obama 2.0  character takes office, is  facebook going with the times  once again? >> here is what i say. From a first principals  perspective, i think mark has  been clear and he gave a great  speech about this many years  ago, that he is a free speech  advocate. The reality is that when you  operate a company like meta at  scale, it's impossible to not  have to manage politics to some  degree. Politics is part of the game  when you run a global platform. You can have strong principals. Having those be clear and  transparent. Giving people tools to hold you  accountable to those are  critical. I think we're in a good moment. Will there in the next 50 years  be times and places where you  have to kind of deal with  political reality and operate in the political climate that  exists? >> of course.  >> i give him a lot of credit  for the speech five years ago. It was at odds with delf  platforming trump at the same  time. To ask you the pointed question, because you know him as well as  anybody, is zuckerberg a  liberal? what is his -- who is he? >> i think the reality is that  the moment we're in, which is an interesting one, we are seeing  personal brands become more and  more important. People standing up and saying,  this is who i am and believe in  more than organizations. I think the reality is, one of  theteresting is you see for large companies,  large universities, this move  toward people saying, i am me,  this is how i tell my story,  hold me accountable to my  principals and what i put out  there. You will see that more and more  from people versus an earlier  age where there was a mentality  of people take a backseat to  organizations and organizations  are kind of a unit of trust. I'm not going to comment on  mark's personal -- my personal  relationship or personal  politics. What i will say is i think you  will see this era not just at  facebook, not just trump and  elon have demonstrated, but a  switch towards people saying  openly and transparently, this  is who i am, these are my  principals, hold me accountable  for those. >> all of that said, he talked  at the end of the video today  about how he was excited to work with the u.s. Government and  protect, i think he said  american companies kind of free  speech. As you and i know, there is not  an american -- the american  internet is still the global  internet. You could have european  officials upset with musk he is  broadcasting an interview on x  that europeans might see. That's why i'm asking, how  serious is zuckerberg about who  he is in and what he believes? is this a fight he is willing to take at the expense of meta if  they start butting heads? they are banned in china. >> at the end of the day, the  internet was born as an  international platform. It turns out that in that single international platform, large  american platforms did  spectacularly well. There are obviously global  companies that aren't american  that are a big part of the  internet. The united states and the  internet are aligned. China was balkanized. I think if we -- there was an  era of large platforms trying to be present everywhere and  placate everyone. We will see a new era of  companie",

        "all right welcome back the New Year kicking off a good time now to look at your portfolio allocations and today Josh Brown ringing the alarm of sorts on being invested exclusively in one stock strategy Josh what's your hot take today that that's right Scott I think uh this is the time of year where we're hearing from investors who are allocated elsewhere and looking at their returns and wondering why they're underperforming uh the major indices to the to the degree that they are a lot of this is uh just being in the middle of a bull market uh some would say toward the end of a bull market but suffice it to say we had 15% is average annual returns for the S&P 500 the NASDAQ obviously substantially higher and you find a lot of people who got back into the market after the great financial crisis or sometime thereafter um but they allocated so heavily to the dividend factor that they really missed out on a lot of what else drives market performance so I am Pro dividend 75% of companies in the S&P 500 do pay a dividend but when you actually analyze it as a standalone factor 54% of the time it Trails the performance of the S&P 500 over all 12- month rolling periods going back 30 years um so I think when you look at the way companies are now allocating capital you go back to 1993 on average companies used uh 36% of their of their of their retained earnings to pay out dividends that number is pretty constant what's changed since 1993 is that the cash used for BuyBacks has gone from 177% to 71% of all corporate cash um and and that buyback strategy is a thing that companies are doing in response to the fact that it's a better deal for stockholders you're not being double taxed the way that you are when you're paid in dividends right because a corporation gets taxed then they pay out of dividend you the investor gets taxed so I I I guess it's not really alarm Bells it's more just me saying look I understand the psychological importance of getting a dividend you feel like it's it's some cash being returned you love seeing it hit your account maybe if you're older you would rather live on the dividends than have to sell stock every year I understand it all but with the dividend only strategy no Berkshire hathway no Amazon no Nvidia uh some of these companies that pay dividends now didn't for the first 20 years of their existence and you lose out on thousands of percentage points in some of the most important publicly traded companies today so it's not anti- dividend it's just be aware that there are huge opportunities in the market to not uh just focus exclusively on that one strategy you want to uh engage bsky I sure do I I love you with all my heart Josh I do but I completely disagree with you uh because I think that when you take a look at dividends you can't look at dividend yield you have to look at dividend growth which we've shown through uh the way that we manage money in fact dividend aristocrats the dvy was up 12% in the US up 15.5% in Canada the the respective portfolios that we run were up 20% in Canada and 17 % in the US here's why because we focus on dividend growth 60% of the portfolio should always be those core names that have never cut a dividend 30% should be the names that are growing the dividend and 10% should be the names that are yields above that if you're buying companies just because of dividend yield you can Will and should underperform that's what you're looking at in terms of the of the factor Josh I don't disagree in terms of I don't disagree with respect to the yield part of it and paying the dividends but we reinvest the dividend it's a longer term fact and all by the way too we've had this amazing run in momentum and as we normalize again I've said it before we're going to be involved in different types of strategies one of which is going to be dividend growth another one is going to be value another one's going to be small cap so I think now is not the time to be leaving dividend growth at all Josh I'll give you the last word we'll move I didn't say a word about dividend growth so I I I don't have any data on that I'm talking about the dividend factor which weights toward High dividend corre that's that's the data that I have companies pay high dividend for dise companies pay high dividend for a reason right because they're not growing and oh by the way you don't want to buy those anyway because fundamentally they're not working well companies pay a high dividend for the most part because their share prices have collapsed and correct and usually that's indicative of a uh disruption risk or a fundamental problem at the company a lot of companies pay high dividends on their way to slashing the dividend entirely in order to survive Brian I think the key thing that I want to get across when I say dividend investing to the exclusion of all other strategies if you were to wait based on shareholder yield versus dividend alone meaning dividend plus buyback your results this is not my opinion quantitatively significantly better um correct there there's this idea that dividends inherently are less volatile stocks completely false the dividend index has a standard deviation of 18.9% versus a standard deviation of 18 uh uh 19.2% for buyback stocks for example so there are a lot of misnomers about the dividend theme my point is it should not be the only reason why you're selecting the equities that you're selecting all right good stuff good stuff guys",

OUR NEXT GUEST SEES TARIFFS AS A MAIN MARKET ITEM TO WATCH IN  2025, KEEPING AN EYE OUT FOR  SIGNS OF WEAKNESS AND  VULNERABILITY AROUND A.I., DAVE  BON10, ARE YOU FEELING MORE  CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE MARKET TO  START THE YEAR? >> I HAVE BEEN CAUTIOUS FOR A  WHILE FROM A VALUATION  STANDPOINT. MY CONCERN IS NOT BOND YEELS. I THINK THE TEN-YEAR GOING  HIGHER COULD BE GOOD FOR STOCKS  IF IT'S BECAUSE OF REAL GROWTH. INFLATION EXPECTATIONS ARE UP 12 BASIS POINTS. THAT'S A LOT OF REAL GROWTH  INCREASE. THAT CAN BE GOOD FOR STOCKS. THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S A  THRESHOLD IN WHICH IT STARTS TO  WEIGH ON THE ALREADY HIGH  VALUATIONS. >> GOOD FOR GROWTH IN WHAT WAY? HIGHER MORTGAGE RATES, HIGHER  CREDIT CARD RATES. THERE'S A REPORT ABOUT  BANKRUPTCIES GOING UP IN THE  U.S. BECAUSE OF HIGHER INTEREST  RATES. THERE'S THE RATE PROBLEM FOR THE ECONOMY, AND THEN THERE'S  INFLATIONARY PRESSURE. >> THOSE ARE TWO TOTALLY  DIFFERENT THINGS. GROWTH IS NOT INFLATIONARY. THAT'S MY BIGGEST DIFFERENCE  OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN  THE BIG NARRATIVE AROUND  INFLATION, THE BELIEF PEOPLE  HAVING JOBS CAUSES INFLATION. IT DOESN'T. MORE SUPPLY, MORE GROWTH IS GOOD FOR INFLATION. IT PRODUCES DOWNWARD PRESSURE. ISSUE ABOUT BORROWING RATES IS  AN ISSUE AND WHY THE FED HAS TO  CONTROL THAT AT THE SHORT END OF THE CURVE. AGAIN, IF YOU START GETTING MUCH NORTH OF 5%, THAT DOES WEIGH ON  EXPECTATIONS. >> YOU THINK THAT'S THE  THRESHOLD YOU MENTIONED EARLIER, 5? >> IT'S NOT A PERFECT SCIENCE,  BUT WE HAVE NOT SEEN IT GO ABOVE 5 AND EVERYTHING IN THE 4s HAS  BEEN BENIGN. STOCKS UP 20% PLUS THE LAST TWO  YEARS IN A LOW. >> OU MENTIONED THE FED CAN'T  DO MUCH ABOUT THE LONG END. CAN CONGRESS? >> CONGRESS CAN DO BAD THINGS  FOR THE LONG END. NOR IS THERE A LOT I WOULD WANT  THEM TO DO. THE FED CAN DO STUFF WITH  QUANTITATIVE TIGHTENING AND  EASING, BUT I DON'T WANT THAT  EITHER. THEY HAVE CURTAILED A LOT OF THE TIGHTENING. THE FED FUNDS RATE IS BEING CUT, AND THE LONG END HAS GONE  HIGHER. YOUR A 35-BASIS POINT SPREAD IN  THE 2-10, THAT'S GOOD IN AN  ECONOMY, BUT WITH VALUATIONS,  THERE'S VULNERABLE. >> YOU THINK IT'S MORE OF A  POSITIVE SIGNAL ABOUT GROWTH  THAN A NEGATIVE SIGNAL ABOUT  FOREIGN DEMAND OR WORRIES ABOUT  OUR FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY. >> THAT'S RIGHT. IF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT  FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY, YOU GET  SOMETHING MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. THIS IS A MARGINAL INCREASE AND  WITHIN A RANGE WE WERE AT TWO  YEARS AGO. AND AGAIN, INFLATION  EXPECTATIONS WOULD TELL YOU IF  YOU WERE WRONG BECAUSE THE TIP  SPREADS WOULD BE BOWING OUT. >> STILL, THOUGH, ISN'T THE THE  WORST ON A TEN-YEAR IN AN EASING CYCLE WE HAVE SEEN MAYBE EVER? >> THE DIFFERENCE IS IT WAS  POSITIVE, WHEN IN 2022, YOU GOT  DOUBLE-DIGIT NEGATIVE. THE IDEA THAT THE TEN-YEAR WAS  AT 3.8, WENT TO THE 4s LAST  YEAR, AND YOU STILL HAD A  POSITIVE RETURN IN TREASURIES,  THAT'S WHAT THE BENEFIT OF A  LONG COUPON CUSHION IS. >> YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT EQUITY  VALUATIONS NOW, YOU SAID. WHAT WERE VALUATIONS WHEN WE  STARTED THE YEAR LAST YEAR? THEY WERE ELEVATED AS WELL. >> THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S NOT A TIMING MECHANISM. SO LOOK, THE TOP TEN STOCKS A  YEAR AGO WERE 28% OF THE MARKET. NOW THEY'RE 38% OF THE MARKET. YOU'RE AT A 1.1% YIELD ON THE  S&P, THE HIGHEST PRICE TO BOOK  IN HISTORY. AND YOU'RE AT 22, 23 TIMES. IT DOESN'T MEAN THE STUFF  COLLAPSES IN TWO MONTHS OR EVEN  SIX MONTHS, BUT IT'S VULNERABLE  AND THE RISK/REWARD IS WHAT I'M  REFERRING TO. THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT INDEX  INVESTORS. >> WE'RE ABOUT TO HEAR FROM  PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP AT  MAR-A-LAGO, WHICH IS AMAZING WE  HAVE THIS NEWS CONFERENCE FROM  THE PRESIDENT'S RESORT AND  COUNTRY CLUB HAPPENING BEFORE HE GETS INAUGURATED WITH THE $20  BILLION INVESTMENT. $100 BILLION FROM MASA A FEW  WEEKS AGO. DOES THAT CHANGE YOUR VIEW AS AN INVESTOR? >> I'M NOT SURPRISED. IN 2016 WITH THE SAME GENTLEMAN  AND THE SAME COMPANY WITH SOFT  BANK, WE SAW A SIMILAR  ANNOUNCEMENT, THAT TIME IT WAS  AT TRUMP TOWER. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A  LOT OF THIS. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE  CURRYING FOR POSITION IN THE  ADMINISTRATION. DATA CENTERS ARE SOMETHING  PEOPLE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN. WE'RE HEAVILY INVESTED IN THE  SPACE. THAT'S JUST A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. I DON'T THINK IT SPEAKS TO  SOMETHING UNIQUE ABOUT THE  ADMINISTRATION. THAT OPPORTUNITY IS THERE  ANYWAY. THE DIFFERENCE IS PRESIDENT  TRUMP WANTS TO USE IT AS SORT OF A SELLING POINT FOR AMERICA. I THOUGHT YOUR POINTS EARLIER  WERE FASCINATED. IT'S SOMEWHAT CONTRADICTORY TO  BLOCKING OF THIS STEEL DEAL.

        "Micron up 6%. Uber coming down. Aurora soaring, 39% on this  partnership. Carl. >> the nvidia halo has been in  full effect today. Thank you. Kristina partsinevelos. >> let's stick with nvidia and  how the street is reacting to  jensen's keynote last night. Joining us is stacey raskin from bernstein. Great to see you again. Sounds like you're not really  willing to draw a line between  the keynote and the price action today. >> no, i don't know. I thought the keynote was good. We can argue there was nothing  new. You have to remember, there was  new stuff, and they have their  event coming up in march where  we'll get a lot more on their  next generation of data centers, but they told us blackwell is in full production. It needs to be, it was nice to  hear that. We had new gaming announcements. The price point on the lower end was very interesting at $544. New automotive announcements,  aurora, and toyota as av  partners. Lots of innovations around  physical a.i. You mentioned the digital work  station. There was a lot for people to  get excited about. I don't think the price action  today really has much to do with anything with what jensen said  or didn't say yesterday. The stock was at a record high,  they're not the only ones  getting hit this quarter. I thought in general, he always  puts on a good show. >> as for the upcoming catalysts whether that's an analyst q&a or jpmorgan health care or earnings next month, what do you thing  will be most important? >> it's like anything else,  people want to get conviction  that the road map is stable,  given there's been some noise  around the blackwell launch,  given how complex those products are. Knowing it's in full protection  is important. People want to get some  confidence on that trajectory. And then i think as we go  through the year, we have --  they do have a q&a today that  i'll be attending. They have, i guess, the jpmorgan health care, earnings, and then  their own gpc event which  happens in march in san jose. I think there's plenty of  catalysts in the near term to  give people confidence, not just on the current road map but the  future road map because the  biggest concern people have, i  have said this before, the  numbers have gotten so big so  quickly, they just worry about  sustainability. How much longer can it go? anything it can give us on the  state of that future road map  and the sustainability of these  numbers is what people are going to be looking for. >> what about the robotics? he shows examples of the maus  cosmos to stimulate activities  in warehouses. I talked to c benioff about  the future of robotics and work. How should investors think about that as a potential catalyst in  this entire gen a.i. Cycle? is this a new wave of demand? >> in general, stepping away  from robotics for a minute,  people want use cases. There's been a lot of spending  particularly in the cloud at the hyperscale level. I think just in general,  enterprise adoption. There's a lot of experimentation going on. We haven't seen anything super  broad based yet. So developing applications that  are going to utilize the  enterprise at the consumer level is going to be very important. I think robotics ieventually  huge. Clearly, right? there's tons of work going on,  not just industrial robots but  as well as he shows humanoid  robots. I could imagine that's something that if you're looking out five  years, en years, that could be  another enormous opportunity. Think about the units of volume  of that they could sell. >> are other chip companies  doing it or just nvidia? >> there's lots of folks that  are working on it. I don't think anybody really is  pushing into these types of  applications whether it's  robotics, av, nobody is really  pushing it and developing not  just the hardware bu",

        "META DID SUSPEND HIS ACCOUNTS  FOR TWO YEARS AFTER THE JANUARY  6th INSURRECTION. CARL. >> JULIA, WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT  IT ALL DAY LONG. JULIA BOORSTIN ON META. IT MIGHT HAVE SOME UMPICATIONS  FOR THE REST OF BIG TECH AND  THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE  INCOMING ADMINISTRATION. DEIRDRE BOSA IS LOOKING AT THAT. >> Reporter: ONE COMPANY IN  PARTICULAR, THE ELEMENTS ARE  FALLING INTO PLACE FOR GOOGLE TO BECOME PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE  FOR INCOMING ADMINISTRATION. MOMENTS AND WORDING FROM  ZUCKERBERG WHERE IT FELT LIKE HE WAS TALKING DIRECTLY TO TRUMP  AND THE MAGA BASE. TOO MUCH CENSORSHIP, RECENT  ELECTIONS AS A CULTURAL TIPPING  POINT. A NEW ERA OF CIVIC CONTENT. MOVING TEAMS OUT OF CALIFORNIA  TO TEXAS. IT REPAIRS A RELATIONSHIP THAT  HAS GROWN EXTREMELY CONTENTIOUS  COMING INTO THE CAMPAIGN WITH  TRUMP SAYING ZUCKERBERG SHOULD  BE JAILED. HE'S ESSENTIALLY RUNNING THE  PLAYBOOK THAT ELON MUSK HAS  DEPLOYED SINCE BUYING TWITTER  THAT ENDEARED HIM TO THE  PRESIDENT-ELECT AND ULTIMATELY  GAVE HIM UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS TO THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION. NOW, IT PUTS THE ATTENTION  SQUARELY ON GOOGLE, ANOTHER  PUNCHING BAG OF TRUMP AND VP  VANCE, WHO HAS DONE LESS AT  LEAST PUBLICLY TO WIN THEM OVER  IN THE LEADUP TO A SECOND TERM  AND WHOSE OWN POLICIES AND  CULTURE COULD NOW GARNER A  HARDER LOOK. YOUTUBE IS A VIDEO SOCIAL MEDIA  CULTURAL POWERHOUSE. AS META ROLLS BACK CONTENT  MOTERATION, YOUTUBE'S POLICIES  BY COMPARISON, THEY'RE LOOKING  MORE STRINGENT AND IDEALOGICALLY BASED. THAT COULD BE FODDER FOR TRUMP'S FCC CHAIR, BRENDER CARR, WHO HAS THREATENED BROAD RANGING ACTIONS AGAINST WHAT HE CALLS A  CENSORSHIP CARTEL. SO NEXT MOVE, THAT MAY GO TO  GOOGLE. THERE'S ALSO THE TRUMP INAUGURAL FUND THAT IS RACKING UP  DONATIONS FROM THE BIGGEST NAMES IN THE TECH WORLD, INCLUDING TIM COOK, SAM ALTMAN, AMAZON, AND OF COURSE, META. GOOGLE AND SUNDAR PICHAI ARE  LOOKING LIKE A GLARING OMISSION. IT IS ALSO THAT EITHER GOOGLE OR PICHAI HAVE DONATED AND ARE JUST NOT WILLING TO PUBLICLY SAY SO,  BUT THAT WOULD SUGGEST GOOGLE  ISN'T AS EAGER TO ALIGN ITSELF  OR PUBLICLY DEMONSTRATE SUPPORT. A KEY REASON FOR THAT COULD BE  ITS WORKFORCE, WHICH IS  TYPICALLY THE MOST PROGRESSIVE  OF THE MEGA CAPS. REMEMBER THAT GOOGLE'S FOUNDING  MISSION WAS DON'T BE EVIL AND IT HAS LONG ENCOURAGED ITS  EMPLOYEES TO VOCALIZE THEIR  VALUES AT WORK. NEARLY 90% OF EMPLOYEE DONATIONS IN THE 2024 ELECTION FROM  ALPHABET WENT TO DEMS. WHILE THAT NUMBER AT META WAS  JUST 80%. AND OFF A MUCH SMALLER BASE. SO ALPHABET HERE, GUYS, IT FACES A VERY DELICATE BALANCING ACT. IT DOESN'T WANT TO AGITATE ITS  PROGRESSIVE WORKFORCE, BUT IT  ALSO WANTS TO AVOID BECOMING A  PRIME TARGET FOR POLITICAL  RETALIATION AND INVITING MORE  REGULATORY SCRUTINY. THE TIMING IS GOING TO B",

        ">>> ALL RIGHT, ON TO OUR CALLS  OF THE DAY.  WE START TODAY WITH SHAKE SHACK  UPGRADED TO OVERWEIGHT FROM  EQUAL WEIGHT, TARGET FROM 159  TO 125.  THAT'S BARCLAYS.  JOSH, TO YOU, NO LONGER  OUTSIZED RELATIVE TO PEERS WE  EXPECT SHARES TO CONTINUE TO  OUTPERFORM THIS YEAR.  >> YEAH, I ALMOST FEEL LIKE A  PARENT WATCHING THIS COMPANY  GROW UP.  I BOUGHT IT THE DAY IT WENT  PUBLIC AND I'VE NEVER SOLD IT.  I'VE ADDED TO IT ON WEAKNESS.  IT'S BEEN A SPECTACULAR WINNER,  I'M NOT SELLING ANY OF MY STOCK  REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH IT'S UP  AS I GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT  WHERE THIS COMPANY IS RIGHT NOW  IS A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN  REALLY FOCUS ON MARGINS AND  THEY CAN REALLY SCALE THIS  BUSINESS AND IT CAN JOIN SOME  OF THE MORE GIGANTIC PLAYERS IN  THE SPACE AS ONE OF THE PREMIER  NAMES.  IT IS TINY IN COMPARISON TO A  McDONALD'S OR A CHIPOTLE OR A  STARBUCKS BUT IT'S EVERY BIT AS  GOOD OF A STORY AS THOSE  STORIES WERE EARLIER IN THEIR  LIFESPAN.  ROB LYNCH IS THE NEW CEO,  JOINED THE COMPANY, HAVING  GROWN PAPA JOHN'S TO THOUSANDS  OF UNITS, THIS IS HUNDREDS OF  STORES BUT IT'S GLOBAL AND IT'S  GROWING AND IT'S THE HIGH- QUALITY OPTION ANYWHERE YOU SEE  IT.  IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FOOD  THAT IS WHERE YOU ARE GOING  VERSUS ANY OF THEIR COMPETITORS  AND I THICK IT'S GOING TO  CONTINUE TO WORK.  >> SNOWFLAKE, STAFF UPGRADED  TODAY OVERWEIGHT.  THEY SAY SHARES APPEAR MORE  FAVORABLY POSITION EADING INTO  2025.  >> OR THAT IT'S DOWN 31% SINCE  LAST FEBRUARY.  IT'S REALLY BEEN A DOG BUT I DO  THINK 2025 THE SETUP IS REALLY  GOOD AND THAT IS BECAUSE  THEY'VE GOT A NEW PRODUCT  CYCLE.  PRODUCT REVENUE GREW LAST  QUARTER 29% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, THE  BEST IN TWO YEARS AND THE  BOOKINGS ARE ACTUALLY  ACCELERATING SO PRETTY DECENT  VISIBILITY.  STILL A STORY BUT I THINK THE  NEW CEO HAS HIS FOOTING AND I  LIKE IT.  >> FREE COURT.  TO PERFORM FROM OUTPERFORM,  TARGET GOES FROM 46 TO 51.  STILL OPTIMISTIC FROM HERE BUT  NOT QUITE AS MUCH?  >> KNOW AND THE STOCK WAS 52 IN  THE MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR.  WE WERE ALL HOLDING AND BUYING  AT THOSE LEVELS.  I STILL LIKE THIS AREA,  FREEPORT AND TECH, BOTH OF THEM  COPPER.  THE DEMAND FOR COPPER IS GOING  TO BE EXTREMELY HIGH.  WE HAVE NOT FOUND OR CREATED A  COPPER MINE IN 10 YEARS AND IF  YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE DEMAND IS  GOING WHICH IS EVs, DATA  CENTERS, ALL THESE THINGS, IT'S  GOING TO BE EXTREMELY LARGE AND  THAT'S JUST SECULAR GROWTH NON- ECKSTEIN A. IF CHINA EVER WAKES  UP YOU'VE GOT EXTRA BUT I'M NOT  BUYING IT FOR THAT REASON I'M  BUYING IT BECAUSE I DO THINK  THIS COMPANY WILL HAVE GREAT  CASH FLOW AND EARNINGS IT'S  JUST GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME.  >> LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT  ABOUT UP TRADE AND OUTPERFORM  FROM MARKET PERFORM, TARGETS  FOR 60.  IT WAS 360.  THAT'S AT BERNSTEIN.  THEY EXPECT TO SEE AN  INFLECTION IN AMERICA'S GROWTH,  STRONGER INCOME CONSUMER,  EASIER COMPS.  WHAT DO YOU THINK?  THIS STOCK HASN'T REALLY DONE  ANYTHING AND IT'S LOOKED PRETTY  DARN GOOD FOR THE LAST FEW  MONTHS.  >> I THINK IT'S TRUE AND WE ARE  -- AMAZON AND TESLA AND THE  PRIOR HIT BUT AT THE END OF THE  DAY LULU IS OUR LARGEST  OVERWEIGHT ON A RELATIVE BASIS  AND CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY.  HERE'S WHY.  GREAT MANAGEMENT, GREAT  PRODUCT, OTHER COMPANIES IN  THEIR SPACE HAVE CLEARLY  TRIPPED ON THEMSELVES, I.E.  NIKE BUT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO  PLAY NIKE AS A VALUE PLAY.  I THINK YOU BUY STOCKS BECAUSE  THEY ARE WORKING FUNDAMENTALLY  AND LULU CLEARLY IS.  THE CEO HAS A GREAT VISION OF  WHAT'S HAPPENING IN NORTH  AMERICA --  >> THIS SEEMED LIKE DEAD MONEY  FOR A WHILE.  >> THEY GOT SOME THINGS WRONG  FOR A WHILE ESPECIALLY WITH  SOME OF THE MERCHANDISE AND I  THINK WITH THEIR CHIEF PRODUCT  OFFICER MOVING ON THEY ARE KIND  OF SETTLING MORE ON WHAT THEY  ARE REALLY GOOD AT.  I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE  GOING TO BE SEEING OVER THE  NEXT YEAR OR SO.  >> TELL ME ABOUT DISNEY.  UPGRADE TO 137, READ BURN.  YEARS OF PRESSURES, DISNEY  FINALLY AT A POINT WHERE  STREAMING PROFIT GROWTH WILL  MORE THAN OFFSET THE LINEAR TV  DECLINES.  IS THAT WHAT THE WHOLE STORY IS  BUILT ON FROM HERE?  >> IT'S NOT THE WHOLE STORY BUT  IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF  THE STORY.  IT'S IMPORTANT FOR DISNEY AND  COMCAST.  YOU NEED STREAMING TO START  MAKING MONEY, YOU CAN'T HAVE --  YOU ARE GOING TO GET THIS  EVALUATION FOR, CURRENT EQUITY,  I THINK ISNEY WAS DEAD MONEY  FOR A LONG TIME.  IT IS ONE OF OUR LARGE  POSITIONS SO IT'S NOT A SMALL  ONE.  AND LOOK, I THINK YOU'VE GOT  CATALYSTS AHEAD.  YOU'VE GOT EIGER WHOSE GOING TO  HAND IT OFF TO SOMEONE ELSE.  >> THEY HAVE TO GET THAT RIGHT  THIS TIME.  >> THEY DO.  THEY HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT AND  THE STOCK IS NOT EXPENSIVE,  IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT I THINK  THERE'S A LOT OF --  >>, HOW ABOUT NITED AIRLINES  WHICH JUST HAD A REMARKABLE  2024?  I THINK IT WAS UP 100%.  TODAY THE TARGET GOES FROM 115  TO 105 AT BERNSTEIN.  THE TARGETS ARE 137, EVEN MORE  OPTIMISTIC OVER AT WOLF.  YOU HAVE UNITED?  >> I DO AND I WILL TELL YOU I  AM SELLING MY UNITED AND MOVING  IT TO DELTA.  >> YOU ARE SELLING YOUR UNITED?  >> I'M GOING TO BE OUT OF  UNITED VERY SOON AND DELTA IS  GOING TO BE MY ONE AND ONLY  BECAUSE THE MANAGEMENT AT  DELTA, THE ROOTS THEY HAVE, THE  SERVICE THEY HAVE, THE QUALITY  OF THE AIRPLANES AND THE -- FAR  SUPERIOR THAN ANY OF OUR U.S.  AIRLINES.  >> YOU'RE JUST DROPPING THAT  LITTLE NUGGET ON US?  BY THE WAY I'M SELLING UNITED.  >> IT'S JANUARY.  >> IT WILL NOT BE A SMALL  POSITION IT WILL BE NO  POSITION.  >> WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO DO  THAT?  >> OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  >> YOU HAVE DELTA.  >> WE HAVE BOTH.  >> DELTA TODAY GOES TO 77 AND  70'S FIVE -- 75.  >> DELTA BY FAR IS THE BEST  AIRLINE.  UNITED IS GREAT BECAUSE WE OWN  A SMALL MID-CAP PORTFOLIO.  AMAZING COMPANY BUT THOSE TWO  YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE BOTH  COMPANIES SO KEEP THE POSITION.  >> WHY WOULDN'T WE ANT TO HAVE  DINNER?  >> I KNOW HE PROBABLY IS.  >> DELTA BY FAR IS A GREAT  OPERATOR, THE FLEET IS GOOD,  THEY ARE EXPENSE CONTROLLED,  PEOPLE FORGET THEY HAVE THEIR  OWN REFINER, ALL THESE THINGS  THAT FROM ",

        "The president-elect. >> and we're honored to welcome  one of the most respected  business leaders in the middle  east, indeed, the world. He's a founder and chairman of  damac properties, hussain  sajwani. Very respected gentleman. And i'm thrilled to announce  today that damac will be  investing at least $20 billion  over a very short period of time into the united states and they  may go double or even somewhat  more than double that amount of  money. A great thing. And i believe he will say that  he's doing it because of the  fact that he was very inspired  by the election. He wouldn't do it without that  election, i can tell you. A lot of people wouldn't. You saw last week where we have  somebody who is going to go from $100 to $200 billion, and we  have many other people, and  we'll be bringing some of them  out. Some of them like to do it  somewhat more quietly, and some  don't. And they feel so strongly about  the country that they want to  let people know about it. But it's an honor to have such a great investor investing in our  country. The investment will support  massive new data centers across  the midwest. The sunbelt area, and also to  keep america on the cutting edge of technology and artificial  intelligence. He's very big into the data  centers, and that's going to be  a very hot item in the coming  years as you know with a.i. In  particular. The first phase of the project  will be in texas, arizona,  oklahoma, louisiana, ohio,  illinois, michigan, and indiana. Those places. And i would love you to come up  and say a few words. Thank you very much. >> thank you, mr. President. It's been amazing news for me  and my family when he was  elected in november. We have been waiting four years  to increase our investment in  u.s. To very large amount of  money. We are a company operating in  more than 20 countries around  the world. We have delivered more than  45,000 luxury units and another  45,000 in the pipeline and data  center, we're in ten countries  around the world, in asia,  europe, and the middle east. And we are very, very excited  now with his leadership and his  open strategy and policy to  encourage businesses to come to  u.s. For the last four years we have  been waiting for this moment and we're planning to invest $20  billio",

ALSO 53% OF THEIR REVENUES ARE  OVERSEAS AND I WORRY A LITTLE  BIT ABOUT THE STRONG DOLLAR SO  THE NEAR TERM IN TERMS OF  EARNINGS RISK WOULD BE  SUBSTANTIAL, NOT TO MENTION  CHINA IS ABOUT 20% OF THEIR  REVENUES AS WELL.

chairing the Federal Trade Commission not once did I hear that the answer to our economic challenges is more monopolization or more consolidation or more mergers will her departure mean more mergers and acquisitions some companies are already poised for deals in 2025 you think it's any coincidence that there is deal after deal I anticipate that there's going to be a deal announced every day meta making moves online scrapping factchecking and bringing back political content interesting timing four years is a long time no one wants to be left out in the cold plus changes in Ottawa at the fed and your calendar but is it too late for a certain greeting happy New Year happy New Year happy New Year late but you're not supposed to say that it's Tuesday January 7th 2025 squawk pod begins right now stand Becky by in three 2 one C please good morning everybody and welcome to squawkbox right here on CNBC we're live from the NASDAQ Market site in Time Square I'm Becky quick along with Joe kernin and Andrew Ross sorin welcome back all three of us together for the first time in a while happy New Year happy year yeah the first time for the first time this year for the first time this year for the first time this year happy New Year nice to see nope there's if Curb Your Enthusiasm that's what I was saying D too late Larry David it's too late except for that yesterday was really the first week back for everybody I think the the third is too late according to him seen somebody yeah that that he doesn't he said two days when anyone says it to him I mean he doesn't just say oh whatever I actually said this yesterday when I said it Larry David would not approve of us saying happy new year at this point me time take a look at this shares of China's 10 cent Holdings falling nearly 8 % overnight this in Hong Kong after the company was added to a list of quote Chinese military companies by the US Department of Defense now 10 cent said in a statement that its inclusion on that list was quote certainly a mistake it said it is not a military company or a supplier and said the listing has no impact on its business now another company added to that list battery maker catl company that is part of the supply chain for automakers that includes Ford and Tesla as well those shares falling as much as 5.6% but closed off the lows they're now down about 2.8% the company saying its inclusion on the list is also a mistake and that it is not engaged in any military related activities doesn't take much no it doesn't take much to be to somehow Find Your Way in into militaries I'm sure that it it wasn't just totally arbitrary that they came well I think the bigger questions probably come back to this the same questions been raised about Tik Tock in that if you are a company in China and the Chinese government asks you all Chinese companies are engaged in trying to but if you're coming in and being part of our supply chain when it comes to automobiles or finding a way to Consumers I think those are going to be the questions that are asked and this is the new we're in competition with China business war and Wars business and and um may not be you know specifically you know going into high performance you know bombers or something but and Canadian Prime Minister just in said that he will step down in the coming months he plans to stay on until his replacement has been chosen through a nationwide party election I truly feel that removing the uh contention around uh my own continued leadership is an opportunity to bring the temperature down he be stepping aside in the party he said he has not been able to bring that party together and is trying to make room for this in election that's coming up in just a few months in the meantime he suspended the gridlocked parliament until March 24th the US dollar is up about 5% against the Canadian Looney just over the last three months Mark Carney former bank of England head um thinking about getting into this and and maybe throwing his hat in the ring as well you got a currency named Looney and let's start there um and then there's this story uh a lot of people uh in Wall Street focused on it maybe Washington as well the Fed top banking regulator plan to step down from that role Michael bar said he would depart from his position as quote Vice chair for supervision that's going to happen on February 28th now that's unless his successor is confirmed earlier than that plans to continue to serve as a member of the fed's Board of Governors so he's not off the board per se but the move avoids what was probably going to be a big battle uh with president-elect Trump bar had said that he believed uh that such a battle would damage the fed's mission now bar has been a key figure in negotiations on what was a proposal to force large Banks to hold more Capital to protect against losses uh and a financial crisis the banks didn't always love Michael bar uh banking groups have lobbied against that proposal and uh I think there was a question as to what would happen next this sort of at least takes off the table for now you know some kind of bigger conversation about the independence of the FED though you could argue maybe this is a conversation about the independence of the FED I I I I mean I I understand why he would do it it makes sense because when you've had questions about whether incoming president Trump would want to keep on uh the head of the Federal Reserve the chairman himself you probably don't want this battle playing out on a lower level because what we've heard time and time again from the the the head of the FED is that look I I'm not leaving I'm I'm staying and I'm staying through the end of my term well so then the question is do you believe this was a this is a politicized situation if it is is that a problem regulation is going down for banks yeah in fact you saw it on that on the bank index thing take a look at thing yeah it's not look what happened starting in November lawsuits about stress tests and capital requirements things are going down he he's up here it's down here just go it just be easier the bank index took off right after the election the world is either getting crazy or getting back to normal meta platforms has added three new directors to its board including UFC chief executive Dana White who was a high-profile campaigner for president-elect Trump the company also added Charlie s Hurst an investor and former Microsoft executive and stellantis uh chairman John elen CEO Mark St Zuckerberg said the addition of the three board members would add a depth of expertise and perspective that's one way of putting it that would help uh it tackle its massive opportunities ahead with AI and wearables and the future of of human connection we just last week we had the other appointment at met you know Nick cigs gone yep uh bringing in a a republican to be for repic was already there but Rising him raising his profile thereany and by the way Dana White don't forget Mark Zuckerberg is is a mixed martial arts U huge fan and then also practices he's been friends with Dana White for a while he's been and has gone to but Dana White definitely will have a uh a different perspective than you normally think of historically for Facebook and Elk gets some sort of a different perspective in Europe because they haven't had that either right right do you got any any resolutions or anything resolutions for the for the new year I thought you told me that we're past we don't have to say happy new year but we're allow no resolution that's in the same category really yeah you need to come up with those on the day of or the day after that's it because you've already abandoned them no no my just point is if you're still sticking with was there anything that you were anything that you see I have a birthday at the same time so I have to reevaluate all kinds of things I sent you a note on your birthday to wish you a happy birthday that and that was about that was about as far as my resolutions were going for the year was that that's not something days in that's your guy who on like important days you've got a list of 5,000 people get a note from you and they're all stupid enough to think that you thought of them and and I I don't I know you know how to do that I don't I do it individually person I think you have birthdays in your thing where they get sent out a automatically is that not true it's not true did you make you have no uh resolutions about how you do things a little differ of course you got to you've got to come into the new year and think you're going to focus on your health more you're going to get better sleep good eat of the what you would Norm the portion you know all the same things but just you know instead of a slab of ribs like for my birthday three ribs how about a half a slap yeah right that you notic that's not the resolution I think about in terms of you in terms of you and and us let's say us this is this is us that's a show is this is us yeah I just think there are things that that you are you know like Dana White you probably think that's like a bad I I'm no I don't okay but certain times we would or Dei that McDonald's we might have an argument about that I'm not going to argue with you about that I'm going to just respect you and your opinion these are your New Year yours oh so he was trying to I see he was trying to create a moment so he could tell us about his great no I was trying to tell you about mine so that you could adopt some of them to make my life a little easy I think I adopted a lot of those a long time ago but you you tell me this is the right way to start the new year that's what I mean yeah this is Happy New Year happy New Year happy New Year late but you're not supposed to say you're not supposed to say it okay coming up move it or lose it teas will be next stay right there because next on squawk pod more meta news Facebook's parent company is doing away with factchecking in favor of a community notes model politically it's a move away from the left is clearly a move away from the left is it about content or is it about politics that conversation with the squawk gang and cnbc's Tech follower John Fort this reminds me of seasoning the soup when you don't have a recipe it tastes like it needs a little bit more of this is coming up next welcome back you're listening to squawk pod from CNBC where we regularly debate the ways technology and the policies around it change the way we live and work and spend our money and our time like this conversation with Joe Becky and Andrew and cnbc's John Fort this morning on our set details com okay stay where you are because this is another text story you might even have some commentary on right now we have some news just coming across the tape from Facebook's parent meta it is ending its current third-party factchecking program in the United States will instead begin moving to what they're calling a community notes program it's similar to one to the one that Elon Musk has implemented on his platform XM will be moving the quote trust and safety teams that write content policies and review content out of California into Texas and other Us locations the company says it will take a more personalized approach to political content so that people who want to see more of it in their feeds can and that's a very interesting move on top of uh both the move to add Dana White to the board which just happened in the last 24 hours add to that potentially maybe the the the the inauguration and the change in the policy officer and the and the and and and getting rid of Nick CLE and I mean there's a lot of of movement that would would suggest this is a true move I don't know if it's a move for the entire platform to the right per se but politically it's a move away from the left is clearly a move away from the left by getting out of California and everything else SE we've kind of seen this movie before going both ways and it's four years is a long time and you don't no one want to be left out in the cold I thought about this yesterday and I won't bring it up but you know when we were at GE uh we were owned by GE and Obama came in you saw mlz currying a favor with it it really launched the whole Eco Med whatever the hell that was that that entire movement was based on curring favor with Obama and basically B almost bankrupted the company and ml just you know went down in flames after it all happened but that had a lot to do with getting in tight with an 8-year Obama administration didn't help the company very much so when it was all it's coming back C thank God but um I mean look at that 4 a and so are you suggesting this is a good idea or a bad idea then because what you you it's a good idea well so but that's what that's why I'm asking you this question there's depends on who you're curring favor with well it depends on what you're who your regul socialist it's not a great idea but it depends on who your Regulators are in some ways we've been talking about this over the last couple of days too John the idea that tech companies some of the big tech companies were very proud of the fact that they were on the opposite coast of Washington DC and tried to keep their distance you saw changes over time with Microsoft after it went through the huge anti-regulatory issues that it had they've dealt with things differently and I wonder if some of the big tech companies are kind of taking note of that and trying to do the same I think so this reminds me of seasoning the soup right when you don't have a recipe it tastes like it needs a little bit more of this you oh it's a little too right they overcorrect in One Direction versus another these platforms are so complicated they got billions of people on or at least you know Facebook meta does they don't know exactly what this is going to do but they're going to try this out and sometimes it does some different things in one country than another but they've got to have a policy where do you stand on this idea of community notes because one of the things that so if you remember if you go back in the history of this Facebook was out there exposed early on because there were people putting misinformation on their platform and then they you maybe you would argue they overcorrected by building an entire sort of content team to try to police everything and this appears to be sort of the reverse of that to say you know what we're actually going to go back to the idea we're going to rely on the community to do this right inform be in thee of the beholder and that's what it was at Facebook I doubt that's what this is it just doesn't make sense to me that they'd be going to okay we're going to go to real people putting notes on these things so much is about AI where's AI going to come into this for things getting flagged to the community or checking the community I I want to know more and but do you want to rely on the quote unquote community that is actually a fundamental question Elon Musk has said that that's how he's obviously done it and he's done it without Andre you don't want to rely on editorial board of a of a Legacy Media operation decide what's misinformation you definitely don't seen that movie media is at 6% approval at this point because that's the way it's been I'd much rather have a influx of of of of common wisdom come into tell me whether something is true or not not you know what the Washington Post editorial take the Washington take the take the folks who you don't like out of the out of there aren't any there aren't any left well that's that's it that's its own problem AR any there is this there is the idea that first of all the stuff that Trends online is typically the most outrageous stuff right like that's how it works clickbait and the second component part of this is that when you have this sort of clickbait typically the stuff that's wrong Trends farther first and it's very hard to put the genie back in the bottle the toothpaste back in the tube whatever it is even when you get the community note or whatever it is on the item at after the fact the number of people who see the correction versus see the first story is usually this is this goes all the way back to Mark Twain and I'm going to not quote him perfectly but he said something about how a li run around the world before truth gets out of bed and puts the pants on but the alternative is so much worse not letting to not to not being you know to to trying to suppress it in a in a consistent logical or Fairway in the first place and this is one of the great questions of our time folks it's a social experiment right every day is we're in it right now it's a simulation maybe maybe not I think it is still to come lenina con's exit interview the FTC chair is heading out in just eight business days she reflects on her 4 years policing regulation and what she's hoping for her successor we are set to go to trial against Facebook this spring against Amazon in Fall of 2026 of course they would want a sweetheart deal and I hope future enforcers wouldn't give them that that's right after this this is squawk poot up and Andrew Q you're watching squawkbox right here on CNBC I'm Andrew R sorin along with Joe kernin and Becky quick a big deal in the image space and when I mean images I mean photos pictures and video Getty Images and Shutterstock announcing they have now entered into a definitive agreement to combine merger of equals it's a deal valued out about $3.7 billion the merger expected to produce annual cost synergies between 150 million and $200 million by year three the new company will operate as Getty Images Holdings and will trade on the NYC under the G um ticker symbol it's an interesting deal because the other thing that's happening is now you have a number of AI companies that want to license photos um to try to capture the value of those at the same time there is a question and I wonder how Regulators will think about this there are very few photo archives like this anymore this is a very unusual and specific archive um Less on the creative side so there's a whole number of creative sites when I say creative sites um you know still images of all sorts of things um that are used in b-roll on TV or all sorts things like that but their Archive of news images is actually super unique and doesn't really exist anywhere else these days in the same way that that others did so that's going to be an interesting one uh to watch and those of us in the news business I I I was thinking about this what was the deal yesterday there was a four four and a. half million doll deal or four and a half billion dollar deal with Steve McMillan the former Striker guy um that was announced yesterday and when you're talking logic now yeah I think he's a whole but when you were talk when you're talking to Lena on later right I mean you think it's any coincidence that there is deal after deal I anticipate that there's going to be a deal announced every day at this point I think you're going to see a lot of deals yeah I don't know about this specific deal I feel small deal but there's there's a lot of things that were waiting in the wings yes and the timing is such now that because there's a new regulatory regime coming in you're going to see deal after deal after deal a lot of deals I'm taking this this particular deal I don't think it's in that category but I think there's going to be a lot more um very very much so [Music] joining us right now first on CNBC for her exit interview is fgc chair lenina KH uh chair con thank you for joining us uh we've been talking to you now for four years uh this is uh you got eight eight more days before it's over business days before it's over I I want to talk about the last four years uh the way the business communities thought about all this the way the business commun thought about you the way youve thought about them and all of that but I what I want to start before we even yet just sort of looking back on this last four years I don't know if you just saw the news that came out this morning from Facebook's uh from meta uh around Community notes they're going to effectively get rid of um their policing if you will of content on their own and they're going to move parts of their team to Texas from California there's a whole sort of move of foot also just yesterday Dana White uh joined the board of meta and the reason I'm even mentioning this is I wonder whether you look at that and this this effort by some of the the tech companies and others as a rebuke if you will of what you and the FTC have been trying to do over the last four years well Andrew it's so great to be here with you and look what the rules are for speech online is an enormously important question and a world in an economy in which those rules are being set by a single company or even a single executive is deeply at odds with why we have the antitrust laws and the anti an Monopoly rise right I mean this is uh an economy that has thrived when we have Fierce competition and I've heard a lot of concerns including on both sides of the aisle about what happens when you concentrate control and have Gatekeepers over who gets hurt and who get sounds like be a fan of what met is doing then well look I think we should have an economy where the decisions of a single company or a single executive are not having extraordinary impact on speech online and I know that's a concern that we hear bipartisan uh members of Congress talk about and so it'll be interesting to see what happens we of course have litigation ongoing there's going to be a trial starting this spring FTC versus Facebook uh alleging that their prior Acquisitions were illegal what do you think though of the relationship that we're seeing between big Tech and the next Administration what do you make of the meetings uh and pilgrimages with which we're seeing Mark Zuckerberg go to Mar Lago or we're seeing a Jeff Bezos or a Tim Cook I mean this is a very different kind of relationship than the administration the Biden administration had and specifically what you represented to the business community so I approached my job with a focus on Faithfully enforcing the law and making sure we were doing that across the economy without fear or favor there has been as you know a lot of concern about dominant digital Gatekeepers again on both sides of the is um and even even as we've seen the president-elect announce some of his future appointments he's noted that he's making these appointments with a view that they're going to continue to maintain a tough line against some of these big technology companies do you think they are given the meetings that we're we're seeing given the million dollar donations to the inaugural I mean I'm on a very personal basis you there's only eight business days left in your role what do you make of that well look I can't predict what future people in my position are going to do it is true that the FTC has been very successful including in its ongoing litigations against Amazon and Facebook and so it's only going to be natural that those companies are going to want to come in and see can they get some type of sweetheart deal right can they get some type of settlement that's cheap that settles for pennies on the dollar and gets them escap lets them escape from a liability finding in court do you see that happening is that what you think is happening I hope it won't but again I can't predict that and we are to go to trial against Facebook this spring against Amazon in Fall of 2026 of course they would want a sweetheart deal and I hope future enforcers wouldn't give them that you mentioned Amazon uh that's a company that just made a documentary deal uh with malania Trump what do you make of that well look I think in general our economy including our Tech sector has done best when we've had open competitive markets right we have an economy that has traditionally shine the centralization approach that other countries have taken we've had an economy where even incumbents have had to look over their shoulders I know you're look you're talking in a very sort of Academic Way about this I I'm asking from a very practical perspective and a personal perspective given the approach that you've taken what you think is going to happen over the next four years and to the extent you've seen these meetings taking place and you've seen the Ric in the business Community by the way you've seen the number of deals that are are that you keep hearing about a sort of massive pip line um that's already started what you think of that people even saying I'm going to do the deal now because guess what lon's not going to be in the job in two weeks so there's no doubt that under this Administration we took a more rigorous approach to enforcing the law and we've been Vindicated in court time after time right I mean just a little over a year ago we introduced new merger guidelines we've now had over a dozen courts cite those guidelines as persuasive Authority there used to be a view that even latently illegal deals for example could be cured by a divestiture of a hodgepodge of assets even if that wouldn't create a competitor we rejected that view including in the Kroger Albertson's deal the court Vindicated us there used to be a view that vertical mergers were presumptively legal or benign we've successfully blocked close to a dozen vertical deals we've had courts vindicate us on going after serial Acquisitions private Equity rollups including in healthcare markets so look is there a risk that there would be a backsliding of course but now that the courts have so resoundingly Vindicated our approach we know that if there is a reversion that's going to be in contravention of the law not because of it me let me ask you this though uh one place where you haven't been Vindicated is this issue around non-competes this idea that the non-compete has been effectively this Texas Texas court is fighting it right um do you think that that was over really broad do you look back and say I wish I had done that differently so the non-compete rule we finalized uh last year uh after 25,000 comments from people across the country sharing as you know these Provisions are now used for fast food workers security guards janitors ultimately we got sued in three different courts each of those courts came out a slightly different place so the eastern district of Pennsylvania said preliminarily the the rule is lawful the District Court of Florida said the FTC does have substantive rulemaking Authority you're right that the Texas judge has put the rule on hold and we are now appealing that um I think we're right on the law I think we have a duty to the American people to eliminate non-competes if we're think they're violating the law and thousands of non-competes have already been dropped for workers because of the ftc's efforts let me let me ask you this you've had you've been in this role now four years you've learned a lot I imagine I hope you've learned a lot what would have you done differently given what you know now what would have you done differently and given that you became a symbol to a large degree uh for many Industries which by the way turned out to ultimately vote for for for president Trump interestingly whether you think about that whether you think that that matters whether you think about the long-term viability of all these things you're talking about backsliding bring Court um cases today that that may it undone later I assume you would have wanted even though I know you don't think you're political you would have wanted um uh vice president Harris to have won or or President Biden to have won and so when you think about sort of the long-term nature of all this what what have you done differently so look of course we would have wanted more time and you know one person I found a lot of inspiration from during my tenure was actually President Reagan's FTC chair Jim Miller who came in with specific Vision with a lot of focus and ended up creating durable change in How We Do antitrust and consumer protection of course directionally I wanted to do something different but in terms of the durable impact that they were able to create that's what we have really looked to follow and I think we have gotten some wins that we be durable one other thing that I really prioritized during my tenure was hearing from Americans across the country right in these types of jobs it's very easy to become insulated hear from people in DC hear from you know dealmakers in New York and one thing I heard from people across the country was a desire for a more aggressive cop on the beat right not once did I hear that the answer to our economic challenges is more monopolization or more consolidation or more mergers and so I think across the country there is a recognition that the work the FTC has been doing is making one thing that you can point to over the last four years that you wish you had done differently well look one frustration always is just how long some of these cases take right I mean the the meta case that's going to trial this spring was filed originally during the Trump Administration uh the Amazon case will not will have taken you know three years and so of course you always think about is there something we could have done differently I know but I'm saying for you your own decisions I mean by the way this this this is the KLA Harris question what would have you what would what would have you done differently what would you do differently and by the way I think she lost a lot of points publicly because she unfortunately uh you know was on The View and was unable to answer that question so I'm asking you what you've been in this job for 4 years there must be something you said you know what I regret that I wish I had done if I had just done that that would have been interesting I've learned something what did you learn across the board there are always hard decisions you have to make about which lawsuits you're going to bring which lawsuits you're not going to bring I think every lawsuit we brought we brought because the law and the facts were on our side overall of course you have to think about resources the FTC ended up you know getting constraints um budgetary wise that made us rethink some of the cases we were bringing but overall I think we used the tools that we were given nothing well look I do think we could have thought through is there a way to move some of these things even faster let me ask you this and it goes relates to Big Tech you obviously there's big case with Google we talked about Amazon there's all these cases out there then there's the AI piece of all of this which is a lot of the cases that are out there today actually are backward looking one of the things you've been looking at is AI and how that's going to change things going forward and also the relationships that many of these companies Microsoft has for example with open AI anthropic has uh with uh Google and Amazon what is the state of that and how do you think that plays out in 20 days from now so we have an ongoing inquiry looking at some of these Investments and Partnerships between the incumbents and some of the newer startups trying to understand what's really going on here are these Investments that are really interfering with the independent decision making and is that going to undermine competition uh that inquiry is ongoing I'm hopeful that we'd be able to share something publicly before um I I end my there there's an announcement you think coming in the next week or two I hope so I mean we're a multi-member commission so we have to vote but what could happen though given I mean what can you do in the next two weeks and by the way how do you feel about doing anything in the next two weeks as it relates to Bringing suits or anything else um given that there is a new Administration coming and some there is an argument uh that you know uh executive orders and other things that the administration is doing today that they shouldn't be doing they should hold off and wait to the next Administration uh to to get into uh into office well look of course we're going to do everything we can to smooth the transition and I've offered that to my um colleagues um but we're going to use every day we have to enforce the law and make sure we're how do you feel about trying to lock something in now I mean that's that's some people would look and say look uh the other guy won and the the American people spoke if you will and so trying to lock people into something today that has that then someone has to try to undo later is unfair well look inauguration will happen when it happens and until there this Administration is in place and I took an oath to enforce the law and do our job as long as I'm in this job um Biden just blocked uh the Japan nipon deal uh with the US Steel I'm curious how you think about and how maybe you think uh president Trump should think about foreign countries that are allies of ours and whether they should be allowed to make Acquisitions in our country so as you know this was a process that was you know led by cifas the FTC doesn't have a role in um thinking through some of those National Security implications I do think across the board though there has been a growing recognition of how extreme consolidation can pose a national security risk right we've heard senior members um at the defense department note how extreme consolidation in the defense industrial base is creating that risk and we've seen how even in areas like you know aircraft manufacturing extreme consolidation could create that risk uh I know people uh including Airline Executives have traced some of the challenges at Boeing all the way back to the McDonald Douglas merger a couple of decades back and so we need to be aware of the deep con ction between having robust competition and how that helps us domestically but also internationally um Trump's pick for your job the successor is Andrew Ferguson you know him uh what do you think of him and how do you think he's going to do this differently than you well look I've really enjoyed getting to work with uh commissioner Ferguson uh we've had you know deep uh engagement and debates and of course I wish him all the best um of course the FTC has been extraordinarily active these last few years and I think there's going to be a lot of expectation uh that the FTC not go weak and just uh you know revert back to a a less rigorous have you had that conversation with him well we're of course helping him with the transition and and providing any type of support that we can what about uh uh the vice president vice president Vance who's apparently a fan of yours have you talked to him uh well look in this role I've had the chance to engage with a lot of senators including with him and have appreciated that on both sides of the aisle there's a recognition that we really need strong anti-monopoly enforcement uh and that's good for America um final question for you what do you think of I mean the sort of sense that there are now individuals in our country uh who are super wealthy who've had enormous success I'm think of Elon Musk on one and Jeff Bezos and others and that now have their hands in lots of different uh pies if you will and whether you think that Regulators need to think about that in a different way than they had in the past MH it's an incredibly important question and you're right that some of how this is playing out is going to look different but historically we did have things like structural separations right I mean even in banking we traditionally had the separation between Banking and commerce the idea being that the entities that are providing credit for the rest of the economy shouldn't be conflicted when they're directly competing with some of those business so so we may need to reactivate some of those principles especially in infrastructure Industries what do you do next right now focused on the next eight business days and uh finishing strong we're going to be running through the tape uh the next eight business days um Becky and Joe uh that is Lena Khan the FTC chair Lena Khan in her exit interview thank you so very much thanks us and that is the Pod for today thank you for listening squawkbox is hosted by Joe kernin Becky quick and

        "thank you very much it's an honor to be with you many things are happening that are EX exciting very exciting for our country and we're honored to welcome one of the most respected Business Leaders in the Middle East indeed the world he's a founder and chairman of deac properties Hussein Sani very respected gentleman and I'm thrilled to announce today that damac will be investing at least 20 billion dollar over a very short period of time into the United States and they may go double or even somewhat more than double that amount of money there a great thing and uh I believe he will say that he's doing it because of the fact that he was very inspired by the election they wouldn't do it without that election I can tell you A lot of people wouldn't you saw last week where we have somebody who was going to go from 100 to $200 billion dollar and we have many other people and we'll be bringing some of them them out some of them like to do it somewhat more quietly and some don't and uh they feel so strongly about the country that they they want to let people know about it but it's an honor to have such a great investor uh investing in our country the investment will support massive new data centers across the Midwest the sun Bel area and also to keep America on The Cutting Edge of technology and artificial intelligence he's uh very big into the data centers and that's going to be a very hot item in the coming years as you know with AI in particular the first phase of the project will be in Texas Arizona Oklahoma Louisiana Ohio Illinois Michigan and Indiana those places and whoin I'd love you to come up and say a few words thank you very much thank you thank you thank you Mr President it's been amazing news for me and my family when he was elected in November we've been waiting four years to increase our investments in us to very large amount of money we are a company operating in more than 20 countries around the world we have delivered more than 45,000 luxury units and another 45,000 in the pipeline in data center we are in 10 countries around the world in Asia Europe and Middle East and we very very excited excited now with his leadership and his open strategy and policy to encourage businesses to come to us for the last four years we've been waiting for this moment and we're planning to invest $2 billion and even more than that if the opportunity in the market allow us but at the moment we planning $20 billion in data center catering for the AI and Cloud business for the hyperscalers fantastic thank you Mr great honor thank you very much so nice and that man knows what he's doing he knows so Hussein we're going to work with you and make sure everything goes smoothly we have powers that haven't really been used in terms of environmental if you uh invest over a billion dollars in the United States we're going to give expedited reviews to everybody because everyone's afraid they're going to come in and get caught in the Quagmire which is uh very prevalent in the United States unfortunately the Quagmire of environmental and various other regulations and rules and I made it a point of telling people if you invest a billion dollars or more and we'll do this for people with far less too but we guarantee it we're going to move them quickly through the environmental process sometimes people held up 12 13 14 15 years I saw it with plants in Louisiana where I got it approved in literally a week they they were through the review in one week after spending 14 and a half years trying to get it and they were going nowhere was a terrible thing so uh I've been a victim of that myself over the years and I think I know all the games and all the tricks that are played and much of it is just just done to uh stop progress so we're going to be helping you and everybody else that comes to the United States and wants to invest their money that you don't get tied up for the rest of your life and you can't do anything this commitment further underscores that many of the greatest Business Leaders on Earth are seeing a very bright economic future for America since the election as you know very a lot of positive things have happened we are inheriting a difficult situation from the outgoing Administration and they're trying everything they can to make it more difficult uh inflation is continuing to rage and interest rates are far too high and I've been uh disappointed to see the Biden administration's attempt to block the reforms of the American people and that they voted for they just we had a landslide election we won every swing state we won the popular vote by millions and millions of people nobody even knows how many people millions and uh they're still counting in some areas you know there they're still counting the vote in some areas can you believe this what a what a place what a hor horrible Place one of the things we're going to do is we've got to fix the election so that we get honors counts and they get done by 10:00 in the evening or something thereabouts they have places where they're still counting votes President Biden's actions yesterday on offshore drilling Banning offshore drilling uh will not stand I will reverse it immediately it'll be done immediately and we will drill baby drill and we're going to be drilling in a lot of other locations and the energy costs are going to come way down they'll be brought down to a very low level and that's going to bring everything else down that's what caused it to go up along with the the ridiculous spending on the green new scam all this money trillions of dollars it's like throwing it right out the window what they're doing and they're trying to spend so much now they're just taking money and giving it to anybody that wants it for any project at all if it's if it's certified under the green news scam and they don't work and it's too expensive and uh you know they told me that uh we're going to do everything possible to make this transition to the new Administration very smooth it's not smooth because they're doing that they're playing with the courts as you know they've been playing with the courts for four years probably got me more votes because I got the highest number of votes ever gotten by a republican by far actually by by a lot and uh you know we had a great election so I guess it didn't work but they're even to this day they're playing with the courts have their friendly judges that like to try and make everybody happy on the Democrat side it's called lawfare it's called weaponization of justice and it's happened at a level nobody's ever seen before so many I defeated deranged Jack Smith he's a deranged individual I guess he's on his way back to the heg and we won those cases those were the biggest ones and uh the Press made such a big deal out of them but we did nothing wrong we did nothing wrong on anything and the people saw that you know when they vote to when you when a republican it's not easy for a republican when the Republican wins the popular vote by millions and wins all seven of the Swing States people said well he could win four we won all seven and we won them by a lot that tells you we won that tells and they've been watching this uh Injustice I call it the Injustice Department what they've done is so bad the whole world is watch that and uh it took work but it got me a lot of votes because when explained we have a judge in New York who's a very crooked judge uh I'm under a gag order I can't even talk about aspects of the case that are the most vital aspects I'm under do you know that I'm the president elect of the United States of America I'm a former very successful President we have the greatest economy and the history of our country we had borders that were sealed and beautiful we had everything was good we had no Wars we defeated Isis we had no Wars now I'm going into a a world that's burning with Russia and Ukraine with uh Israel you took a look at that attack on October 7th the attack on Israel with the horrible uh way they got out not the fact that they got out I would have been out before them but we would have been out of Afghanistan with dignity and strength as opposed to looking like a bunch of Fools With 13 dead and many many badly horrifically injured nobody ever talks about them no arms no legs nobody ever talks about them uh the way they got out was outrageous leaving billions of dollars of brand new military equipment that I bought in the hands of the Afghans and specifically the Taliban it's the group and uh we were doing very well we would have been out we would have been respected I think it's one of the reasons it was so badly handled that withdrawal where people are jumping onto airplanes falling off the sides of airplanes when they're 3,000 ft in the air and uh nobody's ever seen anything like that the worst and because of that I think Russia went and attacked Ukraine when they saw that they said these guys are incompetent they don't know what they're doing but we know what we're doing now and that's going to all end and we have a great military I defeated Isis says you know we were in no Wars I just finished a couple and we got also our soldiers uh guarding Syria and turkey we're in the middle we had 5,000 soldiers that would would have been gobbled up with two armies we had one Army 300,000 we had another one five or 600,000 looking getting ready we had 5,000 people in the middle I said to a general how do 5,000 people do in that case and the general just looked at me said not well sir not well and I took him out and you know what happened nothing I got criticized I saved 5,000 lives actually and uh we did a great job and we're going to do an even better job because now we have a tremendous amount of experience we have people that I can rely on but the 625 million Acres people can't realize it's like the whole ocean take an acre you know an acre you have a house on a half an acre or a quarter of an acre or an acre if you have a an acre you have a big deal now you multiply that by 625 million Acres it's like feels like the whole ocean and that's our strength you know people can say we manufacture we don't manufacture the thing we have we have oil and gas more than anybody in the world we're going to have more of it too but uh they took away 625 million Acres of offshore drilling nobody else does that and they think they have it but we'll put it back I'm going to put it back on day one I'm going to have it revoked on day one we'll go immediately if we need to I don't think we should have to go to the courts but if we do have to go to the courts you know they try to be sneaky they go in and they sign remember this is a man that said he wants the transition to be smooth well you don't do the kind of things you don't have a judge working real hard to try and embarrass you because I did nothing wrong by the way I did nothing absolutely nothing wrong if I did something wrong I wouldn't be standing here right now because I've won all these cases nobody's ever won so many cases as I have against the justice department I mean Jack Smith had cases all over the place people were being subpoenaed lives were being ruined they were spending everything they had money we were helping them out we had to they were being they were subpoenaing people from that had no idea what they were even talking about that's a sick group of people and it was all to influence the election it was all a fight against a political opponent we've never had that in this country we have had that in certain countries we've had that in uh third tier countries we've had that in banana republics but we've never had that in a place like the United States I I don't even know if it's been on a small level I'm sure it has been on a small level but this was the largest level ever they brought this out of the heg he's a mean guy he's a mean nasty guy his picture was perfect cuz you look at his picture you say that's a bad guy with his robe his purple robe and he executes people he shouldn't be allowed to execute people because he'll execute everybody he's a nut job but we want all of those uh cases with him and uh I mean I don't know the judge in Florida but we had a brilliant judge in Florida that saw right through it and we won the case she was brilliant judge with great courage you know the uh the left as we call them the Ral left uh they have a way uh they play The Ref and they play it very hard they play The Ref they go and say horrible things about Judges and prosecutors and some judges and prosecutors say look the only way I'm going to get these people off my back is to give Victory to them they're playing The Ref I think it's illegal what they do it's almost like talking it's worse than talking to a judge but the uh judge in Florida judge Canon was brilliant and tough and she didn't stand for it and I don't know her and uh never met her until the case and I don't believe I said even one word to her but she was very very strong and very very brilliant and her opinion was so brilliant that they dropped their appeal they couldn't beat the appeal so that's what we're up against and so they say we're going to have a smooth transition all they do is talk it's all talk everything they do is talk we're going to have a smooth transition and then they take 625 million acres and they uh essentially Landmark it so you can't ever drill there again well we're going to be drilling soon we're going to be opening up anoir we're going to be doing all sorts of things that uh nobody ever thought was even possible but remember when when and just to get off the subject because I couldn't believe it when I heard it yesterday I couldn't believe the size of it I mean you put down a map and put this up it's just massive and remember that that's worth probably I mean I've had estimates 40 to 50 trillion dollar that's more than our national debt essentially he's throwing it away he's thrown it away he's H taken 50 trillion so if we owe 35 trillion he's taken $50 trillion do of value and thrown it right out the window we can't do that nobody can do that one other thing he did yesterday which was in many ways worse it's hard to believe it can be worse uh he wants all gas heaters uh out of your homes and apartments he wants them to be replaced by essentially electric heaters I don't know what it is with electric this guy loves electric we're going to be ending the electric car mandate quickly by the way this guy loves electric and he we don't have enough electricity and then we have ai where we need more and he wants to get he wants everybody to have an electric heater instead of a gas heater gas heater is much less expensive the heat is much better it's a much better heat uh as the expression goes you don't itch does anybody have a heater where you go and you scratching and that's what they want you to have they don't want you to have gas where you don't have the problems of the electric and the source is plentiful they're much cheaper to operate they're much better they work much better they look much better 60% of homes and apartments have gas heaters he wants them all removed quickly these people people are crazy there's something wrong with them there's something wrong with them they also want to go back and they have already started that to when you buy a foret no water comes out because they want to preserve even in areas that have so much water you don't know what to do it's called rain comes down from comes down from heaven and uh they want to do uh no no water comes out of the shower it goes drip drip drip so what happens you're in the shower 10 times as long you know no water comes out of the faucet you want to wash your hands you they want to go back to even stronger than what they have right now I as you know I ended that policy I get you can have all the water you want makes no difference it comes we especially in certain areas we have so much water we don't know what to do with it uh but these are all things uh they want very very little water to go into your dishwasher almost none and you know what people do they just keep pressing pressing pressing keep it going they end up using more water likewise wash washing machines they want in your washing machine to have very little water coming out of the washing machine so when you wash your clothing you have to wash it four times instead of once you end up using more water uh we're a party of Common Sense and things that I'm telling you now is really all about common sense on January 20th we'll turn the economy around very quickly because right now we have when I think of our economy I think about inflation that's what we have we have inflation I believe uh at a level that we never had before there's never been anything like it and over the next four years the United States is going to take off like a rocket ship but really it's already doing it uh if you take a look just last month soft Bank announced the2 200 billion dollars I think it'll be 200 he said between 100 and I said how about making a 200 and he sort of said yes but let's say it's 100 but it might be 200 right Brian dollars United States creating more than a 100,000 jobs Hussein just announced a tremendous investment that he's going to make and that that's money that's in the bank he's going to come and do it and he'll do a great job and he'll he'll build the best centers in the country I guarantee because I know the way he builds since my election the stock market has set records the S&P 500 Index has broken above 6,000 points for the first time ever never even close in a single month small business optimism soared 41 point points it's not a 41 it went up 41 points and that's the largest in the 39 39e history of the group that does it according to Gallup the American people's confidence in the economy has just surged to the highest level in history that's why I have a news conference like that I take the greatest Business Leaders in the world I say hey do you want to say you're going to invest the money they're not looking for news conferences they're saying what am I doing here they go in and they invest money but it's it's good to know where the smartest business people in the world are investing and they're investing in the United States so we've done this all in two months of not being there you know we haven't been there and uh it's pretty amazing and we think we're going to do some really great things really great things we're being respected again all over the world the Panama Canal is a disgrace what took place at the Panama Canal Jimmy Carter gave it to them for $1 and they were supposed to treat us well I thought it was a terrible thing to do you was the most expensive uh structure ever built in the history of our country relatively it would be the equivalent of over over a tril substantially over a trillion dollars today we lost 38,000 people think of it 38,000 people they died from malarious mosquitoes they were unable to stop the mosquitoes they paid people five times more to take the job many of those people died we gave it away for a dollar but the deal was that you know they have to treat us fairly they don't treat us fairly they charge more for our ships than they charge for ships of other countries they charge more for our Navy than they charge for navies of other countries they laugh at us because they think we're stupid but we're not stupid anymore so the Panama Canal is under discussion with them right now they violated every aspect of the agreement and it's uh they morally violated it also uh and they want our help because it's leaking and not in good repair and they want us to give $3 billion to help fix it I said well why don't you get the money from China because China's basically taking it over China's at both ends of the Panama Canal China's running the Panama Canal and they come to see this Biden this guy who should never have been allowed even to run for president of course she shouldn't have either cuz that never happened I had to beat two people not one but they want3 billion to fix the Panama Canal that's run by China and makes a lot of money China One of the most profitable structures ever built because you have ships lined up back to Florida frankly and they just keep going through and the numbers are staggering half a million to a million dollars a ship and they took it away from us uh meaning we gave it to them for a dollar but uh not going to be not going to happen what they've done to us they've charged us they've overcharged our ships overcharged our Navy and then when they need repair money they come to the United States to put it up we get nothing those days are over working with the Republican majorities in Congress will cut taxes slash regulations raise wages and boost incomes that a pace the world has not seen before and certainly not from our country uh we had a big chunk of it for the first three years of prior to covid coming in in my Administration we had the greatest economy in history we had the we cut the most regulations in the history of our country and I did that all in four years uh by four times more than any other president cut we did that in four years and we were just getting started we'll impose new tariffs so that the products on our stores will once again be stamped with those beautiful words made in the USA and uh we are not treated well as you know by Canada Canada is subsidized to the tune of uh about $200 billion doll a year plus other things that they don't essentially have a military they have a very small military they rely on our military it's all fine but you know they got to pay for that it's very unfair I have so many great friends one of them is the the great one Wayne Gretzky I said run for prime minister you'll win in a it'll take two seconds but he said well am I going to run for a prime minister or Governor you tell me I said I said I don't know let's make it Governor I like it better but no something's going to have to be done same thing with Mexico we have a massive deficit with Mexico and we help Mexico a lot they're essentially run by the cartels and uh can't let that happen Mexico's really in trouble a lot of trouble very dangerous place uh and we're uh going to be announcing at a future date pretty soon we're going to change because we do most of the work there and it's ours we're going to be changing sort of the opposite of Biden where he's closing everything up essentially getting rid of 50 to 60 trillion dollars worth of assets we're going to be uh changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America which has a beautiful ring that covers a lot of territory the Gulf of America what a beautiful name and it's appropriate it's appropriate and Mexico has to stop allowing millions of people to pour into our country they can stop them and uh we're going to put very serious tariffs on Mexico and Canada because Canada they come through Canada too and the drugs that are coming through are at record numbers record numbers so we're going to make up for that by putting tariffs on Mexico and Canada substantial tariffs and we want to get along with everybody but you know they have to it's it's got it takes two to tango we're approaching the dawn of America's golden age it's going to be a golden age for America we have things that nobody else has we have more natural resources we have number one nobody knew that until I came along I made us number one we're number three I made us number one in uh in a very short period of time in drilling and you know you can talk about windmills they litter our country they're littered all over our country like like dropping paper like dropping garbage in a field and that's what happens to them because in a period of time they turn to garbage most expensive energy ever they only work if you get subsidy the only people that want them are the people that are getting rich off windmills getting massive subsidies from the US government and it's the most expensive energy there is it's uh many many times more expensive than clean natural gas so we're going to try and have a policy where no windmills are being built you know off the coast of New Jersey they want to build like 200 windmills that people are going crazy nobody wants them and they're very expensive they don't work without subsidy you don't want energy that needs subsidy energy is a good business you don't need subsidy but when you build these massive towers and they're 25 stories tall 40 stories they have 170 stories tall the blades they take three ships to ship them it's crazy they're dangerous you see what's happening up in the Massachusetts area with the whales where they had two whales wash a Shore and I think a 17-year period and now they had 14 this season the windmills are driving the whales crazy obviously and they had actually over I think 125 or something over over a number of years over a number of years and we don't want that to happen it's a disaster from it's amazing the way a true environmentalist would say oh we love wind it sounds good but that's about where it ends you know after 10 years you have to redo them and what happens is they don't do that they let them stand and they rust and they say because of the environment I'm not a believer in this but they say you can because it's a certain fiid L that the blades cannot be buried in Earth that that's an environment so what do you do with them what do you do with them and I don't know if youve ever gone to Palm Springs California any of these places where you have long-term windmills standing they are disaster they're rusting rotting closed falling down this is as you enter Palm Springs and they put new ones next to them because nobody wants to take them down because why should they take them down it's very expensive to take them down and you can't do anything with them because the blades you can't bury them because of the Environmental Protection we'll look at that doesn't make sense but that's what they say so we we are at the beginning of a great beautiful golden age of business and I think we're also at a golden age of common sense because everything I'm saying to you from a simple water foret that doesn't allow water to come out appropriately to uh all of the other elements of what we do and what we're going to do uh to take 50 to 60 trillion dollars off our country's balance she because some man that has no idea what he's doing has no idea you know it I know it the Democrats know it what they did is a crime by allowing that to happen and I'll bet you if you asked him today how much acreage did you submit essentially did you destroy you destroyed the you destroyed the economic viability of drilling in the ocean and with AI coming along and all you a lot of people don't realize that AI is going to be a big thing but you'll need double the electricity at least that we have right now so right now we produce electricity for many many different things AI is a very big deal in terms of the future China is already building electric facilities big bold electric facilities and you know how they're being fired up with coal they're being fired up with coal and uh we're going to build bigger and better ones people like uh Hussein that are doing the same thing as he is I bet they don't do it as well because I know how he does it but they're doing a lot of things the problem is they can't get their permits because I say build the plant with the building so with the structure build the plant because if you go into grid the grids are old so they said that's a great idea in other words build your electric facility alongside of your plant and you could have extra output if you want because once you build it you can make it larger pretty inexpensively you could have extra output which you'll sell to the public but build it with the plant and people are loving that idea so we're going to have a lot of fun making America great again and it's going to happen I think very very quickly it's already happened so I I would say this and this has been pretty openly reported by the news there's never been anything like what's happened in the list since we won the election couple of months since we won the election the whole perception of the whole world is different people from other countries have called me they said thank you thank you the perception of the whole world is different we're going to have to settle some big problems that are going on right now we're going to have to settle up with Russia Ukraine that's a disaster I look at numbers every week the number of people being killed in that war people don't know mostly soldiers now but the towns have been obliterated this was a Biden Fiasco that he got us he could that should have never happened if we had a real president if we had a president that knew what he was doing Russia would have never ever gone in but they did go in and we have a mess the cities are all blown up the people have largely left and the soldiers are killing each other at levels that haven't been seen since the second world war so we'll have to get that one straighten out too that's a tough one much tougher than it would have been before it started I can tell you that a deal could have been made just by an average deal maker deal could have been made on that uh so thank you all for coming we'll take a couple of questions yeah go ahead please president thank you um wanted to touch on the world on fire that you mentioned but let's start if we could with uh your references to Greenland and the Panama Canal so forth can you assure the world that as you try to uh get control of these areas you are not going to use military or economic coercion no and can you tell us a little bit about what your plan is are you going to negotiate a new treaty are you uh going to ask the Canadians to hold the vote what what is the strategy I can't assure you you you're talking about Panama and Greenland no I can't assure you on either of those two but uh I can say this we need them for Economic Security the Panama Canal was built for our military I'm not going to commit to that now it might it might be that you'll have to do something uh look the Panama Canal is vital to our country it's being operated by China China and we gave the Panama Canal to Panama we didn't give it to China and they've abused it they've abused that gift it should have never been made by the way giving the Panama Canal is why Jimmy Carter lost the election in my opinion more so maybe than the hostages the hostages were a big deal but if you remember and nobody wants to talk about the Panama Canal now because you know it's inappropriate I guess but uh because it's a bad part of of the Carter Legacy but uh he was a good man look he was a good man I knew him a little bit and he was a very fine person but that was a big mistake giving the Panama Canal to Panama was a very big mistake we lost 38,000 people it cost us the equivalent of a trillion dollars maybe more than that probably the most expensive they say it was the most expensive structure if we call it a structure which I guess you can ever built and giving that away was a horrible thing and I believe that's why Jimmy Carter lost the election even more so than the hostages those two things I call on Ukraine and and Iran the two negotiations you'll be heading into um on Ukraine you said just before it's a lot more complicated now much more complicated do you believe because it would have never started right but it has started it's you you've well not only started the cities are largely knocked down You' got what you've got at this point would to hold on to leverage and dealing with uh President Putin would you make a commitment to the ukrainians that you will keep supporting them during the negotiations well I wouldn't tell you if that were the case you make a commitment to provide a security guarantee if they do enter into a Armistice or a ceasefire along the lines that the the French and the Germans so uh you know a big part of the problem was Russia for many many years long before Putin said you could never have NATO uh involved with Ukraine now they've said that that's been like written in stone and somewhere along the line Biden said no they should be able to join NATO well then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep and I could understand their feeling about that but there were a lot of mistakes made in that negotiation and when I heard the way that Biden was negotiating I said you're going to end up in a war and it turned out to be a very bad war and it could escalate that war could escalate to be much worse than it is right now they can never join Nat well my view is that it was always understood in fact I believe that they had a deal and then Biden broke it uh they had a deal which would have been a satisfactory deal to Ukraine and everybody else but that Biden said no you have to be able to join NATO and that's always been and nobody knows more about NATO than I you know years ago when I first started this I didn't know too much about NATO but I got it right anyway I said they're taking advantage I'm the one that got and the Secretary General was here as you know two weeks ago saying that if it weren't for me Netto wouldn't even exist right now because I I raised from countries that weren't paying their bills at that time 28 countries uh 20 of them were not paying their bills 21 to be exact they weren't paying and or they were paying a very small portion and I raised over $680 billion that was the number he gave by saying if you don't pay we're not going to protect you and as soon as I said that the money came pouring in but Obama could have said it other people could have said said it Bush could have said it nobody said it but me I took a lot of heat they said oh that's a threatening statement well they weren't paying their bills I said we're not going to protect if you're not paying the bills so in a true sense I saved NATO but NATO's taking advantage of us and one of the problems that I have and I've said it openly I said it to president zalinski Europe is in for a tiny fraction of the money that we're in now whether you like that situation or not Europe is much more affected than the United States we have a thing called the ocean in between us right why are we in for billions and billions of dollars more money than Europe and you know they're a similar size a little smaller but they're a similar size economy as the United States when you add them up and yet Europe is in for a a small fraction of the number the United States is in now Biden could have called them up during the ter that's what I did I said you have to pay your bills and they all one stood up I won't say who you'll probably have it because the papers the media hated to report on it but a prime minister stood up from a country you know a famous meeting of 28 nations with no press no anybody in the room he stood up he says does that mean if we don't pay our bill and at that point it was 2% it should be 5% it should be 5% not 2% but at that point it was super many people didn't pay some people didn't pay anything but many people were away including ger Germany was at less than 1% well I think NATO should have 5% yeah well you can't do it a two I mean at 2% every country if you're going to have a country and a regular military you're at 4% I think they should be you know they're in dangerous Terror I think you should be they can all afford it but they should be at 5% not 2% uh I'm the one that got them to pay 2% but a gentleman stood up a prime minister stood up and he said to me sir could I ask you a question you're saying we have to pay our bills if we don't pay our bills will the United States protect us from Russia I said if you don't pay you mean you're delinquent he said yes he said if you're delinquent we will not protect you I took a lot of heat although it was somewhat closed door I took a lot of heat from the media and you know what happened the money started pouring in that's why NATO has money and the Secretary General said uh it was the most incredible thing he had ever seen in a negotiation now if I would have said yes we will nobody would have paid if I I would have loved to have say yes we'll protect you even if you don't pay but that's not the way life Works Mr uh two questions related uh to each other first you said on your first day of office you're going to Pardon January 6 defendants are you planning to Pardon those who were charged with violent offenses well we're looking at it and we have other people in there and as you see I guess 24 or 28 people came now from the FBI that came out very quietly nobody reported it but they had people in some form related to the FBI they had four or five people that was strongly related to the FBI we have to find out about that we have to find out about Hezbollah we have to find out about who exactly was in that whole thing because people that did some bad things were not prosecuted you know I see it all the time and you see it too people that were doing some bad things weren't prosecuted and people that didn't even walk into the building are in jail right now so we'll be looking at the whole thing but I'll be uh making major pardons yes please please on Jack Smith report good afternoon Mr President it's good to see you again two questions about Syria and the ongoing war in Gaza about Syria the Pentagon disclosed last month the US has some 2,000 troops in Syria that's almost double the number initially we were told of 900 will you keep that troop capacity the same upon taking well I won't tell you that because it's part of a military strategy but uh I will say it was tury turkey turkeyy has been after that country in different names and different forms and shapes for 2,000 years those people that went in are from turkey and president erdogan is a friend of mine he's a guy I like respect I think he respects me also he's the one that didn't go after certain people after I requested that he not you know who I'm talking about the Kurds I don't know how long that's going because they're natural enemies they hate each other but he didn't do that that yet and he did didn't do it in the past also he started and I said please don't do that and he didn't do it so but if you look at what happened with Syria uh Russia was weakened Iran was weakened and he's a very smart guy and he sent his people in there through different forms and different names and they went in they took over and that's the way it is I'm sorry I interrup do you have concerns about HTS taking control of by the way I have that the envoy here uh is that in the back it is standing with my son Eric is Steve witkoff who's just got back from the Middle East and he's done a fantastic job he's a he's a a great dealmaker I said what we need there is a dealmaker because nobody makes a deal we have people that understand where the rivers are and where the meats bounds and Bounds up but they can't talk they can't make deals Steve's done a great job I just want to thank you Steve you've been working endlessly for months and he's working specifically on the hostages trying to get him back Steve come up for a second maybe you might want to say a couple of words I I didn't know Steve was going to be here actually he's done a fantastic job and it's a dangerous job too and we appreciate it he didn't know about this kind of danger and the other deal making he does now he sees a lot of big danger come on up S Mr President can I ask you second part of that H just one second I'm gonna give you a little report on the hostages if I can Steve thank you very much thank you Mr President wow um well I think we're making a lot of progress and I don't want to uh say too much because I think they're doing a really good job back in Doha I'm leaving tomorrow back to go to Doha but I think that uh we've had some uh some some really great progress and I'm really hopeful that by the inaugural we'll have some good things to announce on behalf of the president I actually believe that uh we're working in tandem in a really good way but it's the president his reputation the things that he that he has said that that are driving this negotiation and and uh so hopefully it'll all work out and we'll save some lives I I believe we've been on the verge of it I don't want to discuss sort of what's delayed it that no point to be uh to be negative in any way but I think it's the president his stature what he said he expects the red lines he's put out there that's driving this negotiation I'm going back probably either this evening or tomorrow night are you confident there'll be a deal before January 20th or is that something that's likely to H if if there a deal even at all and we've been hearing this now for the better part of I I would I would say um they better be right I would say that the president is exasperated I don't want to talk for for him but but look I don't know anyone who delegates better than uh president Trump he gives us a lot of authority to speak on his behalf and he's he exhorts us to speak emphatically and emphatically means you better get you better do this because the alternative think do you think they're waiting for president Trump to take office no I think they heard him loud and clear better get done by the inaugural but when you say all hell will all hell must be paid if they don't release the hostages do I have to Define it for you all hell will break out if those hostages aren't back I don't want to hurt your negotiation if they're not back by the time I get into office all hell will break out in the middle eastate and it will will not be good for Hamas and it will not be good frankly for anyone all hell will break out I don't have to say anymore but that's what it is and they should have given them back a long time they should have never taken them there should have never been the attack of October 7th people forget that but there was and many people are killed they're no longer hostages I have people from Israel and others calling begging me to get you know we had also people there from the United States just so you know they they holding some so-called hostages from the US but I've had mothers come to me and fathers crying can I get the body of their son back can I get the body of their daughter back that beautiful girl where they threw her in the car pulled her by her ponytail and threw her in the car like she was a sack of potatoes I said what happened to her sir she's dead like a 19 20 yearold beautiful girl and the way they treated her and I just say this very simply Steve's got a job to do he's a great guy great negotiator great person they respect him over there already it's what we needed over there we have people that know everything about the Middle East but they can't speak properly they don't know he's a great negotiate that's what I needed I could have sent that gentleman right over there husse sayin he's a great negotiator there are people they're rare great negotiator is a very rare like a great surgeon but we have the right person but I tell this I don't want to hurt the negotiation if the deal isn't done before I take office which is now going to be two weeks all hell will break out in the Middle East thank you Mr you've done a great job thank you than 140 police officers were injured by riers on January 6th will you pardon anyone who attacked a police officer well you know the only one that was killed was a beautiful young lady named Ashley babbit she was killed and there was actually somebody else that was killed also a uh Maga person but people don't give it 100% credibility I'm going to find out about it and we're going to find out but Ashley babot was killed she was shot should have never been shot she was shot for no reason whatsoever in fact they say that she was trying to hold back the crowd and the crowd was made up of a lot of different people so we'll see but I will tell you this uh the person that was was killed was Ashley bab but the other thing is when they talk you know there was never charges of insurrection or anything like that but if there were this would be the only Insurrection in history where people went in as insurrectionists with not one gun okay and let me tell you the people that you're talking about have a lot of guns in their home for hunting and for shooting and for entertainment a lot of lot of good reasons but there wasn't one one gun that they found and why didn't they find the bomber the pipe bomber you know they know who the pipe bomber is the FBI knows who it is the status of the FBI has gone down so far and the status of the doj or as I call it the department of Injustice it's the department of Injustice being laughed at all over the world and hopefully with Pam Bondi and with cash Patel and with other people that were putting in that will all come back uh if do do a poll in the FBI I I guarantee you I'm at like 90% with the Agents of the FBI but they have hurt hurt that incredible Place law enforcement I mean you think of the FBI they raided this house by the way they could have told me could I see this I would have given them I actually told them come in anytime you want you could see anything they raided the house and the case was dismissed and now I'm in litigation I'm suing them for doing that and I feel so badly doing it I'm the president of the United States and I'm suing the United States but I'm suing them for other things too uh the FBI has gone so its reputation has been so horribly hurt between Comey who is the worst and all of the others what's happened to the FBI is and we're going to make it great again we're going to make the FBI great again we're going to make the Department of Justice Fair fair and strong but fair again because all they did was attack me because I'm their political opponent and that includes with local judges like marshan you ought to find out why do ask him why do I have a gag order where I'm not allowed to speak think of it I'm the president of the United States and I'm not allowed to speak why because if I did speak people would understand the scam it's a scam and we have very dishonest judges and New York judges very bad we had one that valued this house at $18 million because it was good for their case he actually valued that that chandelier is worth more than $18 million he valued this house at $18 million and we have another one who was so nasty so horrible such a brute most vicious vile person these are New York judges but we've won most of the cases so we're very happy about that please uh your position is clear but have you directed your staff taking specific actions to draw plans and can you elaborate again you didn't rule out Military coercion uh well we need Greenland for national security purposes I've been told that for a long time long before I even ran I mean people have been talking about it for a long time you have approximately 45,000 people there people really don't even know if Denmark has any legal right to it but if they do they should give it up because we needed for National Security that's for the Free World I'm talking about protecting the Free World you look at you don't even need binoculars you look outside you have China ships all over the place you have Russian ships all over the place we're not letting that happen we're not letting it happen and if Denmark wants to uh get to a conclusion but nobody knows if they even have any right title or interest the people are going to probably vote for Independence or to come into the United States but if they did if they did do that then I would tariff Denmark at a very high level you ask st draw plans for acquisition I you are you AC no we're not at that stage but we have people I haven't even entered office yet secondly sir Elon Musk has drawn some criticism and a lot of attention for some of his actions and and provocative statements about uh foreign affairs including in in Europe uh your reaction to that is that appropriate for you mean where he likes people that were that tended to be conservative I don't know the people I could say elon's doing a good job very smart guy uh I don't know the people you're talking about he he was uh I know he said some negative things about a couple of people that are running for office but that's not so unusual yes please I wanted I wanted to ask you about uh Ukraine and Putin uh how soon do you anticipate going to meet with Putin uh to discuss the Ukraine situation well I can't tell you that but I know that Putin would like to meet I don't think it's appropriate that I meet until after the 20 which I hate because you know every day people are being many many young people are being killed soldiers you know the land is very flat and the hundreds of thousands of soldiers from each many hundreds of thousands from each side are dead and they're laying in fields all over the place nobody to even collect there's landmines all over it's a disaster but it's very flat it's great it's farmland and it's very very flat and the only thing that stops a bullet is the human body and the human body is stopping a lot of bullets with the I hope I hope to have six months no I would think I hope long before six months look Russia's losing a lot of young people and so is Ukraine and it should have never been started that's a war that should have never happened I guarantee you if I were president that war would have never happened would you like to to replace Michael as Vice chair I'll be announcing something Mr President if we were to work under the assumption that you're serious about making Canada 51st state of the United States the leader of the conservative party in Canada said under no circumstances ever be the 5st maybe he won't win but maybe he will you suggested listen I don't so real fast you said you were considering military force to acquire Panama and Greenland are you also considering military force to Annex and acquire Canada no economic Force because Canada and the United States that would really be something you get rid of that artificially drawn line and you take a look at what that looks like and it would also be much better for National Security don't forget we basically protect Canada but here's the problem with Canada so many friends up there uh I love the Canadian people they're great but we're spending hundreds of billions a year to protect it we're spending hundreds of billions a year to take care of Canada we we lose uh in trade deficits we're losing mass we don't need their cars you know they make 20% of our cars we don't need that I'd rather make them in Detroit we don't need the cars we don't need their Lumber we have massive fields of lumber we don't need their Lumber we have to unrestrict them because stupid people put you know restrictions on but I can do that with an executive order we don't need need anything they have we don't need their dairy products we have more than they have we don't need anything so why are we losing $200 billion dollar a year and more to protect Canada and I said that to as I called him Governor Trudeau I said listen what would happen if we didn't subsidize you if we didn't because we give them a lot of money we help them as an example we're buying ice breakers and Canada wants to join us in the buying of ice breakers I said you know we don't really want to have a partner and the buying of ice breakers we don't need a partner but I oh no right nope no right here's what we have we have a right not to help them with their financial difficulties because we owe $36 trillion too we're going to start knocking it out pretty fast but we're going to be able to do it because of energy and other things but uh no no no right no no no right but why are we supporting a country 200 billion plus a year uh our military is at their disposal all of these other things they should be a state that's why I told trudo when he came down I said what would happen if we didn't do it he said Canada would dissolve Canada wouldn't be able to function if we didn't take that 20% of our car up Market you know we again they send us hundreds of thousands of cars they make a lot of money with that they send us a lot of other things that we don't need we don't need their cars and we don't need the other products we don't need their milk we got a lot of milk we got a lot of everything and we don't need any of it so I said to him well why are we doing it he said I don't really know he was unable to answer the question but I can answer it we're doing it because of habit and we're doing it because we like our neighbors and we've been good neighbors but we can't do it forever and it's a tremendous amount of money and why should we have a 200 billion dollar deficit and add on to that many many other things that we give them in terms of subsidy and I said that's okay to have if you're a state but if you're another country we don't want to have it we're not going to have it with European Union either European Union we have a trade deficit of $350 billion do they don't take our cars they don't take our farm product they don't take anything and so we're not going to have it with them either Brian go ahead yes happy New Year by the way thank you we have some breaking news you may not be aware of this but looks like Canon has block the doj uh from releasing the Smith report until further uh Court proceedings get your thoughts on that W that's a big story yeah so uh if I get it right the the fake Witch Hunt started by the doj having to do with books and records and and Biden had many more and he wasn't protected by the presidential records act I was but all of that fake stuff that that took the lives of people I mean literally destroyed people people are destroyed because of what they did destroyed but we got to be president but Biden did it for 40 years he did it when he was a Senator that was illegal and they ruled it was illegal how about that they said it's illegal but he's unfit to stand trial so he can stand and be president of the United States but the prosecutor found that he's unfit for trial I was going to use that as a major talk point but I never got to use it because all of a sudden I had a new candidate who was also sort of unfit to stand trial right but uh so what you're saying is that the judge just blocked the uh so Canon was thrown off the case they dropped their appeal because he had no case they dropped all of that uh the lawsuits against us they lost the lawsuit so this is uh durang jath so he dropped the lawsuits he was told to by the doj because they had no lawsuit they lost in court in front of a very strong and a very brilliant judge they lost in court and that pertained to other cases in other courts so he wanted to do a report just before I take office probably so he'll do like a 500 page report and it'll be a fake report just like the investigation was a fake investigation and I said well wait a minute this guy was thrown off in disgrace in disgrace he's gone back to the hag or wherever they're going to send him in disgrace because he failed so badly because it was a fake case against a political opponent they thought they were going to use this to beat me so what you're saying is the and I I'm just hearing that that they're not allowed to issue the report so if they're not allowed to issue the report that's the way it should be because he was thrown off the case in disgrace why should he be allowed to write a fake report it'll only be a fake report that's great news good and if I can just follow real quickly you want to comment uh many Americans are angry that we're sending millions of dollars every month to the calaban do you anticipate it's it's not even believable billions of dollar not millions billions we pay billions of dollars to essentially the Taliban Afghanistan and that's given by Biden that's the same man that took away 50 to 60 trillion dollar worth of value from the United States think of it probably most valuable asset took away our most valuable asset this can't be allowed to happen we are now a nation of common sense when he does that 625 million Acres this can't be allowed to happen I'm thank you for the information most other people probably knew about it but they wouldn't have told me right on you vowed to bring down the prices at grocery stores very fast but then you recently told Time magazine that bringing down prices which be very hard so what can the American people expect when you get into offices it's always hard to bring down prices when somebody else has screwed something up like they did but we'll bring them down we'll get them down energy is going to bring down prices we're going to have a lot of energy and energy is what brought it up energy and their bad spending is what brought it up and energy is going to bring it down we're going to have prices down I I think you're going to see some pretty drastic price reductions as an example food bacon uh ham Apple everything has gone through the roof it's one of the reasons I won so as you know and I said it inflation was one of the reasons I won but I think the biggest reason I won was the fact that they are allowing prisoners to come into our country they release their prisoners their murderers thousands of murderers are now walking around the streets of our cities and and farmland all over murderers people that they've killed many 32% have killed more than one person they released them from the jails their prisons and their mental institutions and insane asylums into our country I believe that's the reason we got such a large vote all maybe one or two more questions yeah please go ahead go ahead can we you go can can you uh President Carter is laying in state today in Washington you had some harsh words for him about the Panama Canal is there any disconnect there do you feel a little bit bad about doing that on this day no I look I liked him as a man I I disagreed with his policy so hey he thought giving away the Panama Canal was a good thing I think it cost him the election that and the hostages I actually think that was a bigger Factor because that's a deal that just should not have been made but uh again this was a question that was asked of me I didn't bring it up I didn't want to bring up the Panama Canal because of Jimmy Carter's death but people don't bring it up but you know you and other people have asked me about it no it's a deal that I was very strongly against I was a young guy when this took place but just why would we spend spend all of that money lose 38,000 people to malaria the mosquito they were dying it was horrible what was happening they paid them four times more than they would make in the United States but they knew they were going to go over there and die and they died in the jungles of malaria there was nothing we could do to stop it 38,00 and then we gave it away for $1 Congress getting your agenda through Congress you appeared to open the door in your radio interview yesterday uh two Bill approaches it's still your preference for one big beautiful bill as you have said well I like one big beautiful bill and I always have I always will but if if two is more certain it does go a little bit quicker because you can do the immigration stuff early now you have to understand for immigration and for the wall we won the case on the wall you know they tried to sell the wall for five cents on the dollar by the way and we had fortunately a judge that stopped that but they were already discarding the wall and five cents of in the dollar and you know what they were doing they were calling us up and saying we'll sell it back to you at 200 cents in other words double what we paid for it so they were going to buy it from this guy for five cents in the dollar they were making deals and fortunately we had a very smart judge that stopped it called I think he called for an investigation too and he should but think of it they were selling the wall that was exactly the wall that the border of Patrol wanted that was designed by them Ste steel concrete rebar exactly as they want very very heavy steel very powerful steel hard to cut uh very very heavy 7,000 PB concrete which is a very strong concrete everything was top of the line very expensive would be double what we paid for it then six years ago but let me just tell you they were selling it for five cents on the dollar to people and those people were calling us asking us to pay them 200 cents because it's a good deal because we can have it immediately and you know what immediately is just leave it in place no no the the the papers haven't written that though you that that deal is like all the other things that these people doing these people either hate our country or they're very stupid and I don't believe they're stupid because nobody can cheat on elections like they cheat and be stupid they either hate our country or they're stupid so remember what I said cuz nobody wants to reported they were selling the wall for 5 cents on the dollar and trying to resell it back to us for 200 cents or less but for 200 cents on the dollar that's a that's a nice return stop putting fact checks on a posts on its website and meta said today would stop putting fact checks on its website and inste allow Community well I watched their news conference and uh I thought it was a very good news news conference I think they've honestly I think they've come a long way meta Facebook I think they've come a long way I watched it the man was very impressive I watched it actually I watched it on Fox I'm not allowed to say that say it do you think he's directly responding to the threats that you have made to him in the past probably yeah probably the last time we were the last time you were here you were asked a question about the US possibly launching a preemptive strike on Iran you said you wouldn't answer that question obviously on Iran the US launch apprehen strike on Iran's nuclear facilities and I said I don't I don't talk about it it's a military strategy but it is a legitimate question well it's not really because only a stupid person would answer it look it's a military strategy and I'm not answering your questions on Military strategy all right one more Brian go ahead could you give us a preview of what you might be talking to leaders of Congress you were expected to come here uh the next couple of days and You' got a very uh supportive Congress behind you they're great so we have a wonderful Republican Congress we have a leader that I have a lot of confidence and I think he's going to be hopefully a great leader a great speaker and we have a leader by the way in the Senate I think has been great John Thun has been doing a fantastic job but it goes through the house first and the question is whether or not we do the two bills the one bill and you know look I can live either way I like the idea of the one big Bill but I can live either way but they'll be coming down the Senators also will be be coming down and then ultimately we'll be meeting in the White House in a few weeks but right now this is uh the winter season you know they sort of call this the winter white house it was built I don't know if you know this marjerie marowa the post and EF Hutton built this it was the greatest of all the Estates in our country and I saved it and I got a lot of credit for saving it most of these big great houses have been knocked down in Palm Beach just about all of them actually and they you know you built 10 mansions on one site but we saved it but this was built as the southern white house and she gave it to the government and by the way Jimmy Carter gave it back he said it's too expensive for the United States so I didn't I didn't realize that I was just I was just told actually Jimmy Carter Nixon was through Watergate he came down he Nixon came here once and he thought it was incredible but he had a thing called Watergate if anybody remembers that and uh so he had other things on his mind to put it mildly and uh Jimmy Carter felt that it was too extravagant for the country so fortunately for me he gave it back to the foundation and I brought it from the foundation recation some Republicans saying in in in trade for a massive bill that that you and they share the interest in they want to see big spending cuts uh do you agree with that what well I'm okay with spending cuts I like spending cuts just I'm on the record for spending cuts and the debt ceiling was given to us it shouldn't have been but it was put in our lap and what I want in terms of debt ceiling isn't the ceiling I I just don't want to see a default that's all I want I never talked about spending more money necessarily than all I want to see is no default because nobody knows what would happen if there was a default it could be 1929 and it could be nothing but that was put into our lap and it shouldn't have been but it was and so we'll handle it but uh debt sealing is not about raising a lot of money it's really just about extending it I just want to see an extension on immigration sir on immigration um how much can you do by executive order are you planning to do on Executive Order when it comes to immigration and how much do you want Congress to tackle this issue and also on day one I at the safest Border in the history of our country by far you you remember the famous chart that I brought down I love that chart very much for a lot of reasons but I have the safest border by far in the history of our country and when I took it over it was a mess nothing like it is now this is 10 times worse what I got elected because of the border the first time and I think I got elected largely because of the border the third time and the second time I did equally well well not as well as the last time but I did very well and I will say this was too big to rig you know you know the expression too big to rig they couldn't do it they tried but they couldn't do it uh I didn't get very much from Congress at all I just said that we're being invaded and I took the money out of the military much of the wall I built 500 over 500 miles a wall much of that wall was built through money that I put into the military we took it out because we couldn't get things from Congress in those days and we took it out and that wall was built largely with money coming from the military so very simple I went to the military I said our country is being invaded by very similar nothing like what's invading our country now they weren't releasing prisons into our country and they weren't releasing mental institutions in but some some Bad Dudes were coming in right and I said our country is being invaded and I took that money largely from the military I was sued nine times by the Democrats in Congress and I won all those suits and we built five we ended up building 571 miles of wall once that wall was built they start going around it so we're going to add another 200 that would have been up in 3 weeks and then we had a very unfortunate election result and they said we don't want to put it up we'll sell it and they started selling it for 5 cents on the dollar what what is so we'll do this again I just want to thank everybody very much I'm just telling you this will be the Golden Age of America this is the Golden Age of America we're going to have a great country again we're a country right now Under Siege we have so many different problems and nobody respects us overseas but now they do the Italian Prime Minister as you know came here the other night just flew in and flew out you wanted to she wanted to see me and uh great respect is being shown when I went to the cathedral in France great respect was shown by the Prime Minister the president by everybody France was and by the way I have to say they did a great job in the cathedral but great respect is being shown to our country again and uh we have a great country but we have to run it properly it's going to be run properly uh we want to get back those hostages for isra and for us you know we do have people that are hostages being held and I'll just say it again if this deal is not done with the people representing our nation by the time I get to office all hell is going to break out thank you very much Ukraine Russia War before you take office can you clarify what you mean by military force in the Panama Canal there's no one",

        "Suing the biden administration  over its decision to block the  two companies' merger plans. The lawsuit alleging biden  influenced national security  review for political reasons. U.s. Steel ceo dave burritt  joins us now. Dave, thank you for the time.  >> thanks for having me.  >> so you seem very fired up  about this, first in your  statement and in the lawsuit. Your reaction to the decision,  you called it shameful and  corrupt. You're clearly angry with the  president. Explain why you feel this way. >> well, it's very clear that he tainted the process of cfius,  the committee that decides  whether or not this deal has any national security risks, of  which there really are none that couldn't be easily mitigated. From the very beginning he made  it very clear that he was a  union man, that he was  supporting the international  union and he didn't give the  opportunity for cfius to fulfill their duties, fulfill the due  process of cfius. We all know cfius is supposed to be a robust process, we know  it's supposed to be confidential and it was neither robust nor  confidential and that's largely  because he decided before this  even started that he as favors  to the union boss for votes, he  was willing to taint the process to get what he wanted for those  votes and didn't let the cfius  process play out, as it is  supposed to play out. >> well, do you have any  evidence for why the -- why you  say the cfius process did not  play out as it was supposed to  play out and why you were denied due process? >> well, he started out with the process that said it had to be  american owned and operated and  there is nothing in the cfius  process that says it has to be  american owned and operated. He said there were supply chain  issues of which there really are none that can't easily be  mitigated. Said there were national  security issues over which there are none. In fact, it strengthens national security, it strengthens  economic security, it  strengthens job security. In fact, grows the business. This is a fabulous deal. Can you imagine somebody  investing in the united states,  billions of dollars, and then  above the basic labor agreement  billions of dollars more to make this company fantastic. This is an amazing deal, but it  didn't get the chance. It didn't get the chance to go  through the process in a robust  way and was in effect decided  early on that it shouldn't  succeed and it was delay after  delay after delay until they  finally ended up canceling.  >> i do want to clear up  something that has been out  there as far as those who are  cynical and wondering why you're fighting so, so hard on this  deal and that is it's in your  best interest to get that deal  done. That $72 million golden  parachute that you would get if  it were sold. I know you were questioned on  capitol hill from the senators  on this. I mean, how much of that is a  motivation factor for you? >> zero. The motivation here is to do  what's best for our company, our country, our employees, our  workers and to, in fact, do  what's best for the planet. There is no doubt this is a  fabulous deal for all  stakeholders. People just need to spend a  little bit of time understanding it and once they do understand  it, they will see that you have  a great investor willing to  spend money in the united states and grow this business  profitably to the benefit of the workers and the communities in  which we live and work. It is a remarkable deal and  that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to right the wrongs of this president and make sure  that cfius is actually followed. The process has been corrupt, i  know it, you know it, i mean,  let's face it, god knows that  th",

        "SEVERAL YEARS TO SEE VERY RAPID  BREAKTHROUGHS, SURPRISING  BREAKTHROUGHS.  >> OUR NEXT GUEST WAS AT THAT  EVENT, THE CES IN LAS VEGAS AND  HE DESCRIBES IT MORE LIKE A ROCK CONCERT AS THAN A TECH CEO  SPEECH. DAN IVES JOINS US NOW. HAS A BUY ON NVIDIA, PRICE  TARGET IS 200. GOOD MORNING, DAN. LET'S TALK ROBOTICS AND  AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGY. YOU SAY IN YOUR TALKING POINTS  OR YOUR REVIEW OF THE SPEECH  THAT ALONE REPRESENTS ANOTHER  TRILLION DOLLARS OF INCREMENTAL  MARKET OPPORTUNITY THAT NVIDIA  CAN NOW TAP INTO OVER THE COMING YEARS. HOW DO YOU GET TO THAT NUMBER  AND HOW DO YOU DERIVE THE VALUE  YOU ARE FOR I HAVE HAD FROM IT? >> I MEAN, LOOK, TO ME I THINK  JENSEN LAID OUT THE STRATEGIC  VISION FOR THE COMING YEARS. WHEN WE LOOK AT ROBOTICS,  AUTONOMOUS AND I BELIEVE  ULTIMATELY THOSE ARE GOING TO BE SOME OF THE BIGGEST USE CASES OF AI. WHAT YOU SAW FROM NVIDIA LAST  NIGHT IS THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING  TO BE A PROVIDER, THEY'RE GOING  TO PLAY A HUGE ROLE IN THIS SORT OF VISION. OBVIOUSLY THE AUTONOMOUS SIDE  CONTINUES TO BE FRONT AND  CENTER. I THINK THIS IS THE NEXT STEP. I THINK THIS IS A SNAPSHOT OF  THE FUTURE AND YOU LOOK AT IT  INCREMENTALLY, YOU GO OUT THE  NEXT FEW YEARS I THINK THE  STREET IS UNDERESTIMATING GROWTH BY 25%, 30%, WHICH IS WHY I  THINK NOT JUST $4 TRILLION, YOU  COULD BE LOOKING AT $5 TRILLION  MARKET CAP.  >> UNDERESTIMATING GROWTH BY  30%. IS IT ROBOTICS? WHAT'S BEING UNDERESTIMATED SO  TO SPEAK IN TERMS OF THE GROWTH  FOR THIS COMPANY? >> I THINK ONE IT'S BLACKWELL,  WHICH IS FROM A DEMAND  PERSPECTIVE, WE THINK 15 TO 1  DEMAND IN SUPPLY IN TERMS OF  WHAT WE'RE SEEING. WHEN YOU LOOK AT ROBOTICS AND  AUTONOMOUS GIVEN THE MARKET  OPPORTUNITY THAT COULD  ULTIMATELY BE 15%, 20% OF WHAT I VIEW AS DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY. I MEAN, THAT COULD BE AN  INCREMENTAL 20%, 25% JUST TO THE TOP LINE OVER THE NEXT CALL IT  TWO, THREE YEARS. I THINK THAT TO ME WAS THE SORT  OF WATERSHED MOMENT LAST NIGHT. IT'S JENSEN LAYING OUT NVIDIA -- IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BLACKWELL  CHIPS, THE NEW OIL GOLD, IT'S  ABOUT WHERE THIS IS ALL GOING. WE BELIEVE AUTONOMOUS AND  ROBOTICS, THAT'S A HUGE PART OF  THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL  REVOLUTION.  >> RIGHT. SO WHAT DOES A ChatGPT MOMENT IN ROBOTICS LOOK LIKE, DAN? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? >> I THINK PHYSICAL AI. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ROBOTAXI IN  OCTOBER, I THINK WE WILL BE  LOOKING THE NEXT TWO, THREE  YEARS ROBOTICS IS NOT JUST GOING TO BE FROM CES IT'S GOING TO BE  REAL AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING  THAT'S GOING TO PLAY OUT  FACTORIES, IN CONSUMERS AND  HOUSEHOLDS. I THINK A YEAR FROM NOW WE  STARTING TO MORE ADVANCED  PROTOTYPES TO SOMETHING THAT'S  GOING TO BECOME A REALITY. I THINK THAT'S THE KEY HERE. WE ARE STILL IN THE EARLY DAYS  OF THE AI REVOLUTION. THERE'S ONLY REALLY ONE PLAYER,  I MEAN, IT'S NVIDIA'S WORLD,  EVERYTHING ELSE IS PAYING RENT. THAT WAS A FLEX THE MUSCLES  MOMENT FROM THE GODFATHER LAST  NIGHT.  >> WHAT ABOUT WHAT I WAS JUST  TALKING ABOUT, DAN, WHICH IS  HIGHER YIELDS AND THE FACT THAT  ALL OF THOSE STOCKS ARE DOWN  TODAY? I KNOW YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE  FUNDAMENTALS AND INNOVATION BUT  DOES IT MAKE YOU QUESTION  VALUATIONS WHEN WE'RE SEEING A  RATE MOVE LIKE THIS? >> THAT'S THE PUSH AND PULL AND  I GET IT, BUT MY VIEW, SARA, IS  THAT WE HAVE $2 TRILLION OF AI  CAPEX THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND  EVEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT TECH, LOOK AT MICROSOFT GOING TO 80 FROM  44, BASICALLY DOUBLING THEIR  CAPEX, YOU LOOK AT NUMBERS, YOU  COULD SEE VALUATION BUT I THINK  IT GOES BACK TO I THINK EARNINGS AND ULTIMATELY TOP LINE GROWTH  FOR TECH IS BEING MASSIVELY  UNDERESTIMATED AND THAT'S WHERE  THE GROWTH IS.

WHAT ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS TELLING  YOU AND HOW IT IMPACTS YOUR  BUSINESS AS WELL? >> WE ARE IN TOUCH WITH A LOT OF CUSTOMERS, AS YOU MENTIONED. YOU KNOW, RIGHT BEFORE THE  HOLIDAY SEASON, WE WERE TALKING  ABOUT MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF DISRUPTION  LIKE THE PORT STRIKE, POTENTIAL  COULD BE, WE HEAR FROM OUR  CUSTOMERS THE IMPORTANCE OF  COMMUNICATION AND VISIBILITY AND THEY ALSO, YOU KNOW, ARE  ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THIS  WHENEVER WE HAD DISRUPTION LIKE  THIS. YOU KNOW, WE SEE THESE  DISRUPTION AS HAPPENING MORE  OFTEN AND OUR ROLE IN HELPING  OUR CUSTOMERS IS TO HELP THEM  PLAN FOR THESE AND NAVIGATE  THROUGH THEM. WE DO A GREAT JOB OF THAT AT  ARCBEST.  >> DEPENDING ON THE ESTIMATES,  THIS STRIKE, IF IT HAPPENS,  COULD COST $4.5 BILLION TO $7.5  BILLION PER WEEK. WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF TARIFFS WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKE OVER ON JANUARY 20th. ARE YOU SEEING MORE OF YOUR  CUSTOMERS MOVING THEIR FREIGHT  TO THE WEST COAST PORTS TO TRY  TO AVOID THE STRIKE AND ALSO  TELL US WHAT ARE THEY DOING WHEN IT COMES TO TARIFFS? WHAT ARE THEY SAYING TO YOU? >> ON THE WEST COAST, YOU KNOW,  MOVEMENT THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN, YOU  KNOW, PLANNING AHEAD AND  ADDRESSING THAT, BUT WHENEVER WE THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS, THEY  REALLY END UP BEING OPTIONS FOR  CUSTOMERS. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SEEN MANY  DISRUPTION OVER THE YEARS. YOU KNOW, WE'RE A COMPANY THAT'S BEEN IN BUSINESS NEARLY 100  YEARS AND WE'VE SEEN ECONOMIC  UPS AND DOWNS AND MULTIPLE  ADMINISTRATIONS AND PANDEMIC. WHAT WE HELP OUR CUSTOMERS DO IS STAY FLIXABLE EXIBLE WITH THE A  TO ADAPT. MANY OF THESE EVENTS ARE  SHORT TERM IN NATURE AND YOU CAN NAVIGATE THROUGH THEM WITH SOME  OPTIONS AND DIFFERENT SOLUTION  DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR SUPPLY  CHAINS. YOU KNOW, WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS  REALLY HELP STAY CLOSE TO OUR  CUSTOMERS AND HELP THEM THROUGH  THE THINKING THAT IS  NEEDED. MAYBE BETTER SOURCING AND  CAPACITY FOR THE PROVIDERS IN  THE EVENT THESE THINGS HAPPEN SO WE CAN BE SURE THEY GOT THE BEST OUTCOME. >> TRYING TO MITIGATE THE  DISRUPTION. I IMAGINE. I WANT TO ASK ABOUT SOMETHING  THAT'S COMING UP. A TIME PERIOD IN A FEW WEEKS  FROM NOW. MID-JANUARY. WE HIT ON THE POTENTIAL FOR THE  STRIKE AT THE PORTS AND THE  TARIFFS POTENTIALLY AND EARLIER  THAN NORMAL LUNAR NEW YEAR. >> YES. >> THOSE ARE THINGS YOU HAVE  BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT. THIS IS A LONGER TERM QUESTION. DO YOU THINK THIS POTENTIAL TIME THAT COULD HAVE A LOT OF  CONGESTION AND CONFUSION, DO YOU SEE THAT POTENTIALLY BREAKING  THE U.S. OUT OF THE FREIGHT  RECESSION WE HAVE BEEN TALKING  ABOUT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS? DOES THIS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO  MAKE COMPANIES MINDFUL AND STACK MORE INVENTORY AND REVERSING  SOME OF THE DECLINES WHEN IT  COMES TO RATES WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS? >> I THINK THESE ARE ALL THINGS  THAT COULD COME TOGETHER AND  CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE THAT, BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IS -- IS THE PLANS THAT YOU CAN  PUT TOGETHER TO ADDRESS, YOU  KNOW, THE SHORT-TERM ISSUES. WHAT WE LIKE TO DO IS -- IS  THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS WITH  OUR CUSTOMERS OVER THE LONG TERM AND, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE  HORIZON THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO  THEM.

WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT  COMMUNICATION AND VISIBILITY  AND, YOU KNOW, THEIR MARGINS ARE SQUEEZED ESPECIALLY WHEN CERTAIN EVENTS LIKE THIS HAPPEN. SO, THERE'S AN OVERRIDING THEME  WHICH IS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY  AND REDUCE COSTS. THE CUSTOMERS WE DO BUSINESS  WITH ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT  THIS YEAR. WE'VE BEEN DOING SOME WORK IN  OUR CITY ROUTES, YOU KNOW, THAT  HAVE REALLY OPTIMIZED THOSE. WE SAVED $13 MILLION IN SAVINGS  LAST YEAR AND WE'RE LOOKING  FORWARD TO DOING MORE AND USING  A.I.

We see it goes kind of the  market around high tech and  certainly around a.i. You know, i liked that it wasn't just a hey, guys, we have a new  chip coming. To some extent, that gets easy  to promise and say, but we don't know when yet and kick the can. These are real -- these are real actionable items and real things that are going to be really  useful in robotics and  self-driving cars and showing  the widening in high the a.i. T.

Involved in other areas in  the market. Gaming and also put out their  own mini desktop computer which  was interesting. Why isn't this just bullish  across the board? why do you have some  reservations? >> to some extent, it is because how high the market already is. We see it in the after hours  trading after the keynote. Nvidia didn't jump a ton, but  when you think about it and you  open at an all-time high, how  much more do people want to load in? the reality is to some extent,  the market re-digested this. Things that are incrementally  good, will be less market moving for the broader market. I certainly think that, you  know, the taiwan semiconductor  asml is in a different position  than microsoft mainly riding the a.i. Trade on what i would think of as v-1 a.i.

BUT, THIS YEAR MAY BRING A SENSE OF INCOME, THE CONCEPT OF INCOME IS BACK. THAT'S WHAT MAY HELP SMOOTH SOME VOLATILITY THIS YEAR. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. SO THE 4% IS THE NUMBER WE'RE  KIND OF LOOKING AT.  >> 4% IS NOT THAT GREAT, YOU  KNOW? >> 2% PLUS INFLATION RATE IT'S  OKAY.  >> POST TAX, PEOPLE LOOK THROUGH IT, OKAY. WHAT DID I REALLY POCKET FROM  THIS? >> WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT  LONG-TERM THEMES. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADDRESSING  VOLATILITY THIS YEAR.  >> FAIR ENOUGH. JEFF, YOU LOOK AT ITY AND THIS STUFF ALL THE TIME. AS WE HAVE TO WAIT -- IT'S  POSSIBLE, THE ADVISERS MENTIONED IN THIS \"WASHINGTON POST\" PIECE, THE PRESIDENT MAY BE DENYING IT, IT'S OBVIOUS THERE ARE SOME IN  HIS CIRCLE TRYING TO MOVE  FORWARD WITH THIS IDEA OF THINGS BEING LESS UNIVERSAL THAN HE  CAMPAIGNED ON AND ONE OF THE  REASONS HE MIGHT CONSIDER A  SLIGHT CHANGE ON THIS FRONT IS  INFLATION. IT'S BEEN STICKIER THAN EXPECTED AT THIS POINT. AND ANY TARIFFS WILL END SOME  NEAR-TERM PRICE PRESSURE.  >> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT, KELLY. IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE THAT  TOUGH TALK THAT WE'VE SEEN ALL  CAMPAIGN, PRIOR TO  PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP WINNING  THE CAMPAIGN BACK IN NOVEMBER,  BUT SINCE THEN, OR SINCE THE  INSINUATION THAT HE WAS GOING TO WIN, YOU SAW THE DOLLAR INDEX  MOVE HIGHER BECAUSE OF THOSE  TARIFFS. SAW AN 8% JUMP IN THE U.S.  DOLLAR INDEX. THE VIX OUT AT 16 AND IES  MOVING HIGHER. TO JOHN'S POINT, THERE'S A LOT  OF UNCERTAINTY. CATALYST FOR THIS MOVE HIGHER  TODAY IS SELLING OFF HERE,  CATALYST WAS THERE WOULD BE LESS TARIFFS. THE TARIFFS COME WITH UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. INFLATIONARY CONCERN, BUT THE  FLIP SIDE POTENTIAL MORE REVENUE FOR THE FED. MANUFACTURING JOBS MAY BE  RESHORED. ALL THIS UNCERTAINTY WILL  PROBABLY NOT BE UNPACKED ON  JANUARY 20th OR JANUARY 21st. WHAT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE IS THE  DOLLAR INDEX, U.S. TREASURY, 10  YEAR NOTE, UP TO 4.6%. THAT EXCITE VOLATILITY. WE'RE ALL FOCUSSED ON AI. WONDERFUL TO SEE NVIDIA BACK  ABOVE $150. YOU SEE THE TARIFF POLICY BE  IMPLEMENTED AND TRANSACT INTO  THE ECONOMY, THAT'S WHERE WE'LL  SEE VOLATILITY. I WANT TO BE HEDGED. I LIKE USING A COUPLE DIFFERENT  ETFs. DBEF A WAY TO BE HEDGED ALSO  LOOK AT THE WISDOM TREE. YOU WANT TO HAVE A SELECT  EXPOSURE TO SOME OF THIS. BUT BEING HEDGED HERE WITH THIS  CURRENCY RISK THAT WILL BE A BIG THEME AND NO ONE IS TALKING  ABOUT IN Q1.  >> HIGH DOLLAR AND HIGH YIELDS  IN THE MARKET, WOULD YOU AGREE  WITH THAT? >> IT IS. AND SOME PEOPLE SAY 10 SHF YEAR  NOTE GOES UP TO 5%, IT WOULD BE  MORE ATTRACTIVE. ALL THE FOLKS WHO DUMPED INTO  10-YEAR NOTE 5% AND THEY WERE  REMORSEFUL. SO I THINK THE RISK IN THE  MARKET IS LOOK AT TODAY. WE SAW HISTORIC HIGH, THE TOP  TEN HOLDINGS OF S&P 500 WENT UP  TO 50% OF THE MARKET CAP OF THE  S&P 500. THE MARKET CAP OF THE S&P 500 IS 46 TRILLION HALF REPRESENTED IN  JUST TEN NAMES THIS MORNING. THIS VULNERABLE OF A RESET IS  COMING. I WELCOME THAT TO HAVE THE  ABILITY TO HAVE A MORE BROAD  RALLY. THERE'S NO DEPTH IN THE CURRENT  RALLY. SAME AI THEME, WHICH YOU CAN'T  GET SHORT. I LOST A LITTLE MONEY BUYING  PUTS ON SOME OF THESE NAMES. WILL BE A BIT OF A REVALUATION,  KELLY.  >> JOHN WHAT WOULD YOU ADD? >> THREE THINGS  ING AGAINST  STOCKS. JEFF TALKED ABOUT TWO, THE  DOLLAR, YIELDS. AUTOMATIC STABILIZERS ARE MOVING UP TRYING TO SLOW THINGS DOWN. NOW YOU HAVE OIL IN THE MIX. OIL HAD THIS STEALTH RALLY UP TO 74 A BARREL IN THE UNITED  STATES. SO NOW YOU HAVE THREE ITEMS KIND OF PUSHING AGAINST STOCKS. TELLS US WE NEED NEUTRAL  ECONOMIC NEWS, LET THOSE COME  DOWN A LITTLE BIT. >> YOU DON'T WANT THE JOBS  REPORT ON FRIDAY TO BE GOOD.  >> NO. WE NEED SOME NEUTRAL NEWS. AUTOMATIC STABILIZERS ARE GOING  IN REVERSE GOING UP TRYING TO  SLOW THINGS DOWN.  >> RIGHT. I TAKE YOUR POINT. BUT IN THE LONG RUN -- LOOK,  JEFF JUST SAID, WE NEED KIND OF  THE BUSINESS CYCLE TO BE IN  TACT. RIGHT? WE NEED THE GROWTH TO BE -- WE  NEED ALL OF THAT RIGHT NOW  ESPECIALLY GIVEN WHAT MAY BE  COMING DOWN THE PIKE FROM THIS  ADMINISTRATION.  >> YES. BUT YOU HAVE A FED MONETARY  POLICY THAT'S GOING TO BE A TAIL WIND. ASSUMING YOU HAVE FISCAL POLICY  THAT WILL BE A TAIL WIND. WE DON'T KNOW TRADE POLICY, TAX  POLICY, IMMIGRATION POLICY. THOSE ARE THE UNKNOWNS.  >> IS THE FED A TAIL WIND? >> THEY HAVEN'T BEEN A HEAD  WIND. STILL SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO  CUT TWICE THIS YEAR. TO US THAT'S A TAIL WIND.  >> OKAY. JEFF, WHAT WOULD YOU ADD TO  THAT? >> TO JOHN'S POINT, THE $7  TRILLION BALANCE SHEET DOESN'T  SEEM LIKE POTENTIAL MISSTEP OF  CUTTING 100 BASES POINTS BACK IN SEPTEMBER, WE SEEN THE 10-YEAR  NOTE GO UP 100 BASES POINTS. THERE'S A LOT OF CROSS CURRENTS  RIGHT NOW, KELLY. I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME, AS YOU KNOW. I HAVE THE GRAY HAIR TO SHOW. SEEMS LIKE AT THIS MOMENT IN  TIME THERE'S ALMOST A  CAPITULATION TO THE UPSIDE IN  SOME OF THESE AI STOCKS BECAUSE  THE REST OF THE PARTICIPATION  WILL BE IMPORTANT. BUT CORPORATE PROFITS ARE STILL  IN TACT. U.S. CONSUMER IS STILL IN TACT. JUST SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A LINEAR MOVE. JOHN HAS BEEN AROUND THE MARKETS AS WELL. THINGS DON'T MOVE IN A STRAIGHT  LINE.  >> GIVE ME A FINAL COMMENT ON  OIL. TO JOHN'S POINT HOW IT HAS BEEN  BACKING UP. NOW AROUND 74 A BARREL. IT'S NOT PUNITIVE FOR CONSUMERS  YET. IS IT FINALLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE ENERGY INVESTORS WHO DID  UP 2% LAST YEAR? >> YEAH. AND CHEVRON OR EXXON ARE TWO  HOLDINGS I REALLY LIKE HERE. WHAT'S INTERESTING TO SEE, IF  PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN BRING PEACE  TO THE MIDDLE EAST, HOW WILL  THEY REBUILD MIDDLE EAST? SUCH DAMAGE THE MIDDLE EAST. WHAT IS PREDICATED ON ALL  BUDGETS THE MIDDLE EAST IS OIL. THE PRICE OF OIL BY SOME FORM OR FASHION OF SUPPLY CONSTRAINT  YOU'LL SEE THE PRICE OF OIL GO  HIGHER. PEACE THE MIDDLE EAST, PRICE OF  OIL WILL DROP. BUYING OPPORTUNITY. SPECIFICALLY IN AN EXXONMOBIL OR CHEVRON.  >> WHY DO YOU THINK IT ENDS UP  GOING HIGHER? >> BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO REBUILD. HOW CAN ALL THESE MIDDLE EAST  COUNTRIES REBUILD? THEY HAVE TO RAISE THE PRICE OF  OIL TO FUND THE REBUILDING. IT'S AN OLD PLAY BOOK, KELLY. RUNNING FOR DECADES THE MIDDLE  EAST.  >> THAT'S FINE. NOW THE U.S. IS A MAJOR OIL  PRODUCER. CAN'T WE JUST OFFSET THAT? >> WE JUST HAD 625 MILLION ACRES OF CRUDE OIL OPPORTUNITY BANNED  BY THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. WILL THAT BE A BIT OF GRAPPLING  UNTIL THAT PRODUCTION COMES  ONLINE. THAT'S THE UNCERTAINTY JOHN AND  I ARE REALLY TRYING TO UP NPACK  HERE. SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY WHEN THE  POLICIES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND GET TRACTION. THAT'S WHERE THERE'S CONCERN. THERE SHOULD BE CONFUSION. THE FIX AT 16 NOBODY SEEMS TO  CARE, KELLY.",

THE DISPUTE IS AUTOMATION AND  SEMI AUTOMATION AT THE PORTS. DO YOU HAVE A VIEW? >> IT IS NEEDED. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BASIC  TECHNOLOGY. THE BASIC TECHNOLOGY WE NEED TO  EFFICIENTLY AND SAFELY OPERATE A MODERN PORT. YOU KNOW, WE PRIDE OURSELVES IN  THE UNITED STATES OF HAVING THE  BEST INFRASTRUCTURE AND BEST  BUSINESSES IN THE WORLD, BUT WE  DON'T HAVE A SINGLE PORT THAT'S  IN THE TOP 50 IN GLOBAL PORTS IN TERMS OF OPERATIONS BECAUSE THE  LEADERSHIP OF UNIONS LIKE THE  ILA KEEP OPPOSING THE  INTRODUCTION OF BASIC TECHNOLOGY INTO PORT OPERATIONS. IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE PRICE OF  GOODS, IF YOU CARE ABOUT GLOBAL  TRADE, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT  FIGHT THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE  HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO  MODERNIZE OUR PORTS.  >> I WANT TO BE CLEAR, NEIL. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT PRICES FOR CONSUMERS. ARE YOU SAYING THAT IS  INFLATIONARY? >> ABSOLUTELY. IT COSTS MORE TO LOAD AND UNLOAD GOODS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR  PORTS. THE LONGER IT TAKES AND THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT IS, THE MORE YOU  AND I PAY FOR THE GOODS WE BUY  AND MORE EXPORTERS PAY FOR THE  GOODS THEY ARE TRYING TO SELL  OVERSEAS. THIS IS A LOSE-LOSE PROPOSITION. THAT'S WHAT THIS DISPUTE IS  ABOUT. IT IS IMPORTANT THE ILA CHANGE  ITS POSITION AND ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY CAN ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF WORK FOR  ITS MEMBERS AND MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR ALL AMERICANS.  >> WE HEARD SIMILAR COMMENTS  YESTERDAY FROM THE TRADE GROUP  FOR APPAREL AND FOOTWEAR. I WANT TO ASK THE CHAMBER, YOU  REPRESENT A BROAD SWATH OF  BUSINESSES. HAVE YOU BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE  CURRENT ADMINISTRATION AND  INCOMING ADMINISTRATION? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO THEM? THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS  NOT INVOLVED IN THE TALKS AND NO REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE WHITE  HOUSE ARE INVOLVED. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE MORE  INVOLVEMENT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE OR INCOMING ADMINISTRATION? >> I THINK ULTIMATELY WE WILL  NEED INVOLVEMENT FROM BOTH. LAST FALL WITH THE SHORT  THREE-DAY STRIKE, WE WERE AT THE FOREFRONT TO CALL THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION TO INTERVENE AND  CONCLUDE NEGOTIATIONS. THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE TERMINAL  HERE. THE 15th, EIGHT DAYS FROM NOW,  FIVE DAYS BEFORE THE  INAUGURATION. WE CAN'T AFFORD FOR THE CURRENT  ADMINISTRATION TO DROP THE BALL  ON THIS. IF WE END UP IN A STRIKE, WHICH  IS SOMETHING WE ALL WANT TO  AVOID, IT'S GOING TO BE  INCUMBENT ON THE INCOMING  ADMINISTRATION TO DEAL WITH THAT AND ITS AFTERMATH.

        ">>> welcome back to \"squawk  box.\"  joining us right now first on  cnbc for her exit interview as  ftc chair, lina khan.  thank you for joining us.  we've been talking to you now  for four years.  eight more days before it's  over?  >> business days, that's right.  >> business days, before it's  over.  i want to talk about the last  four years, the way the  business communities thought  about all of this.  the way the business  communities thought about you,  and the way you thought about  all of them.  but i want to start before  looking back on these last four  years, i don't know if you saw  the news that came out this  morning from facebook, from  meta on community notes,  they're going to effectively  get rid of their policing, if  you will, of content on their  own and move parts of their  team to texas from california.  there's a whole sort of move a  foot, also yesterday dana white  joined the board of meta.  the reason i'm even mentioning  this is i wonder whether you  look at that, and this effort  by some of the tech companies  and others as a rebuke, if you  will, of what you and the ftc  have been trying to do over the  last four years.  >> well andrew, it's so great  to be here with you.  look, what the rules are for  speech online is an enormously  important question.  and a world and an economy in  which those rules are being set  by a single company, or even a  single executive, is deeply at  odds with why we have the  antitrust it laws and the  antimonopoly rise.  this is an economy that has  thrived when we have fierce  competition.  and i've heard a lot of  concerns, including on both  sides of the aisle about what  happens when you concentrate  control and have gate keepers  over who gets heard and who  gets to speak.  >> it sounds like you're a fan  of what meta is doing then?  >> look, i think we should have  an economy where the decisions  of a single company or single  executive are not having an  extraordinary impact on speech  online.  i know that's a concern that we  hear bipartisan members of  congress talk about.  so it will be interesting to  see what happens.  we, of course, have litigation  ongoing . There's going to be a  trial starting this spring.  ftc versus facebook, alleging  their prior actions were  illegal.  >> what do you think of the  relationship we're seeing  between big tech and the next  administration?  what do you make of the  meetings and pilgrimages of  which we're seeing mark  zuckerberg go to mar-a-lago, or  a jeff bezos or a tim cook?  this is a very different kind  of relationship than the biden  administration had.  and specifically what you  represented to the business  community.  >> so i approach my job with a  focus on faithfully enforcing  the law and making sure we were  to go that across the economy  without fear or favor.  there has been, as you know, a  lot of concern about dominant,  digital gate keepers again  across the aisle.  as we've seen the president- elect and future points, he's  noting that he's making these  appointments with a view that  they're going to continue to  maintain a tough line against  some of these big technology  companies.  >> do you think they are?  given the meetings that we're  seeing, given the million  dollar donations to the  inaugural.  only eight business days left  in your role.  what do you make of that?  >> look, i can't predict what  future people in my position  are going to do.  it is true that the ftc has  been very successful including  in its ongoing litigations  against amazon and facebook.  so it's only going to be  natural that those companies  are going to want to keep in  and see if they get some type  of sweetheart deal.  can they get some type of  settlement that's cheap and  lets them escape from a  liability finding in court.  >> do you see that happening?  is that what you think is  happening?  >> i hope it won't.  but again, i can't predict  that.  and we are set to go to trial  against facebook this spring.  against amazon in fall of 2026.  of course, they would want a  sweetheart deal and i would  hope that future enforcers  wouldn't give them that.  >> you mentioned amazon.  that's a company that just made  a documentary deal with melania  trump.  what do you make of that?  >> look, i think in general our  economy, including our tax  sector has done best when we've  had open competitive markets.  we have an economy that has  traditionally shunned the  centralization approach that  other countries have taken.  we've had an economy where even  incumbents have had to look  over their shoulder.  >> you're talking in a very  sort of academic way about  this.  i'm asking from a very  practical perspective, and  personal perspective, what do  you think is going to happen  over the next four years in the  extent you've seen these  meetings taking place and  you've seen the rhetoric in the  business community.  by the way, you've seen the  number of deals that you keep  hearing about a sort of massive  pipeline that's already  started.  what you think of that.  people saying, i'm going to do  the deal now, because guess  what, lina khan's not going to  be on the job in two weeks.  >> so we took a more rigorous  approach to enforcing the law,  and we've been vindicated in  court time after time.  we've now had over a dozen  courts cite those guidelines as  persuasive authority.  there used to be a view that  even illegal deals could be  cured by divestiture.  we've rejected that deal,  including in the kroger  albertson's deal.  the court vindicated us.  there used to be a view that  mergers would be benign.  we've blocked close to a dozen  deals.  we've had courts go after us on  private equity roll ups,  including in healthcare market.  so look, is there a risk there  would be a back sliding?  of course.  but now that the court has  resoundingly vindicated our  approach, we know if there is a  reversion that's going to be in  contravention of the law,  because of it.  >> one place where you haven't  been vindicated is this issue  of non-competes.  this texas court is fighting  it, right?  do you think that was overly  broad?  do you look back and say i wish  i had done that differently?  >> the noncompete rule we  finalized last year after  25,000 comments from people  across the country sharing, as  you know, these provisions are  now used for fast food workers,  security workers, janitors.  ultimate we got sued in three  different courts.  each of those courts same out  of a slightly different place.  so the everyone district of  pennsylvania said  preliminarily, the rule is  lawful.  the district court of florida  said the ftc.  you're right that the texas  judge has put the rule on hold  and we are now appealing that.  i thin",

        "BOX.\" CANADA'S PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN  TRUDEAU PLANS TO RESIGN AFTER  NEARLY A DECADE IN POWER. HE WILL STAY ON AS PRIME  MINISTER UNTIL HIS LIBERAL PARTY JOINS. WE BRING IN BRUCE HAMAN WHO  SERVED AS AMBASSADOR TO CANADA. BOY, ARE WE THERE RIGHT NOW. MR. AMBASSADOR, THANK YOU FOR  JOINING US. MAYBE ONE OF THE FIRST  CASUALTIES OF A TRIP TO  MAR-A-LAGO, AMBASSADOR. >> YOU KNOW, WHILE THOSE DOTS  LOOK TO CONNECT, THE REALITY IS  IN CANADA, PRIME MINISTERS OF  EITHER PARTY, CONSERVATIVE OR  LIBERAL, HAVE ABOUT A TEN-YEAR  TERM. WHILE THEY HAVE BEEN REELECTED  VARIOUS TIMES, AND IT ISN'T A  TERM, BUT TEN-YEAR LIFE EXPECTLY AS PRIME MINISTER AND TRUDEAU IS AT THAT MARK RIGHT NOW. IT IS NOT SURPRISING. ALSO IN A POST-PANDEMIC WORLD,  WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT IN THE WESTERN WORLD  AND CANADA IS NO EXCEPTION  HAVING FACED THE SAME IN THE  UNITED STATES WITH INFLATION AND COST OF GROCERIES AND RISING  LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT DEBT AND  THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. SO, LOOK, HE FACED A BATTLE  WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY AND HE  ADDRESSED THAT DIRECTLY WHEN HE  ADDRESSED THE CANADIAN PUBLIC  AND HE KNEW THAT HE KNEW THE  ELECTION WAS SCHEDULED TO TAKE  PLACE THIS YEAR. HE KNEW IT WOULD BE VERY  DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO SURVIVE  THAT. >> OKAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE  IMPLICATIONS OF THIS AND HOW THE POLITICS CHANGE IN CANADA AND  HOW THAT CHANGES THE  RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED  STATES. >> SO, LET'S JUST GO AT A HIGH  LEVEL FIRST OF ALL FOR ALL  AMERICANS. THE U.S. HAS NO BETTER PARTNER,  NO BETTER ALLY, NO BETTER FRIEND IN THE ENTIRE WORLD THAN CANADA. WE'RE LUCKY CANADA IS OUR  NORTHERN NEIGHBOR. IF WE WENT AROUND THE WORLD AND  CHOOSE ANYBODY, WE WOULD GO BACK AND CHOOSE CANADA AGAIN. HOW IT WILL CHANGE? I THINK IT IS A GOOD MOMENT IN  SOME RESPECTS THAT WE HAVE A NEW LEADER IN THE UNITED STATES AND  NEW PRIME MINISTER IN CANADA. IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO  SIT DOWN AND HAVE A DIALOGUE AND BUILD ON WHAT WE HAVE DONE SO  SUCCESSFULLY AND HISTORICALLY IN BUILDING THIS INCREDIBLE  RELATIONSHIP. YOU KNOW, OVER 2/3 OF THE UNITED STATES STATES THEIR NUMBER ONE  EXPORT MARKET IS CANADA. YOU  I HAVE TRAVELED WITH REPUBLICAN  GOVERNORS IN PROMOTING TRADE  RECENTLY IN THE LAST YEAR WITH  GOVERNOR PRITZKER FROM ILLINOIS. IT WILL BE A GOOD RESET MOMENT  FOR TWO LEADERS TO SIT DOWN.  >> WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS,  THOUGH, WHAT IS THE TAKE INSIDE  OF CANADA ABOUT SOME OF  PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP'S  COMMENTARY AS IT RELATES TO  CANADA BEING THE POTENTIALLY  GREAT 51st STATE OF THE UNITED  STATES? WHAT DOES THAT DO TO THE PSYCHE  OF ALL THIS? >> WELL, LOOK, THERE'S A RANGE  OF REACTIONS. SOME OF THE REACTIONS ARE  THINKING IT IS HUMOROUS. OTHERS, YOU KNOW, TAKE IT AS A  COMPLIMENT. YOU THINK WE'RE SO VALUABLE UP  HERE, YOU LIKE US TO BE PART OF  THE UNITED STATES. THE REALITY IS THE CANADIANS ARE VERY PROUD PEOPLE. THEY ARE NEXT DOOR AND SOME  AMERICANS THINK THEY ARE JUST  LIKE US. THEY'RE NOT. THEY ARE A UNIQUE CULTURE. I EXPERIENCED THIS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER IN BUSINESS AND  POLITICS. I WILL TELL YOU I THINK IT JUST  ENERGIZES AND GIVES THE  OPPORTUNITIES FOR CANADIANS TO  COME TOGETHER WITH THE DIALOGUE  WITH THE UNITED STATES. I THINK EVERYTHING DONALD TRUMP  WOULD LIKE TO SEE GET  ACCOMPLISHED WITH CANADA CAN BE  DONE DIPLOMATICALLY AND DONE  BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND  CONVERSATIONS WITH NEW  AMBASSADORS AND NEW SECRETARY OF STATE COMING IN MARCO RUBIO AND  UNDER. FOR THE MOST PART, THIS IS THE  RICHEST RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. >> IS THERE ANYTHING TO -- ANY  JOKE THEY ALWAYS SAY THERE IS  SOME TRUTH. SAYS  THAT THE TRADE IMBALANCE WITH  THE U.S. SUBSIDY DIES WHAT  HAPPENS IN CANADA? THAT'S THE POINT HE IS MAKING  BEING NEXT TO THE VERY LUCRATIV  CERTAIN WAYS, YOU SAY THERE ARE  SMALL AREAS THAT AREN'T FAIR. IS THAT ALL IT IS AT THIS POINT, MR. AMBASSADOR? >> JOE, I SAT DOWN WITH THE  FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER AND  LOOKED ACROSS THE TABLE AT SAID  THAT WE HAVE WITH CANADA? AFTER A PREGNANT PAUSE, SHE SAID THERE ARE NONE. I SAID THERE ARE NONE? WE HAVE KEYSTONE PIPELINE AND WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, STUFF WITH  LUMBER AND THE DETROIT WINDSOR  BRIDGE. WHO PAYS FOR THAT? >> MILK. >> MILK. WE HAVE MILK AND DAIRY. SHE SAID --  >> REAL MILK. NOT ALMOND MILK. >> WE JUST HAVE OPPORTUNITIES. NOW, THE TRADE IMBALANCE THAT  PEOPLE ARE REFERRING TO IS  SUBSTANTIALLY ENERGY. LOOK, WE NEED THAT ENERGY IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE BENEFIT  FROM THE STRONG RELATIONSHIP. THE ENERGY THAT WE GET FROM  CANADA IS OF ALL TYPES. IT'S FROM RENEWABLES TO FOSSIL  FUELS. IT'S FROM HYDRO TO SOLAR. SO, LOOK, I THINK THE  OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THE  ENERGY RELATIONSHIP IS THERE,  BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS TRADE  DEFICIT IS SMALL IN TERMS OF THE TOTAL SIZE OF THE RELATIONSHIP. WE HAVE A MULTIBILLION DOLLAR  DAILY TRADING RELATIONSHIP AND  INVESTMENT RESPECT LATIONSHIP T  CREATES JOBS ON BOTH SIDES OF  THE BORDER. IT IS BETTER FOR BOTH OF US. WE CREATE JOBS AND WE'RE BETTER  AS A RESULT OF I",

        ">>> OUR NEXT GUEST JOINS US NOW  TO WEIGH IN ON PRESIDENT-ELECT  TRUMP'S ECONOMIC AGENDA AND THE  REORDERING OF POWER IN  WASHINGTON.  LET'S WELCOME GOVERNOR CHRIS  SUNUNU OF NEW HAMPSHIRE.  HIS FOURTH AND FINAL TERM ENDS  THIS THURSDAY.  >> TWO MORE DAYS.  48 HOURS.  AND THEN I BECOME A REAL  NUISANCE FOR EVERYBODY.  THEN I CAN SHOOT MY MOUTH.  >> YOU MIGHT BECOME A  CONTRIBUTOR HERE.  I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU AS A  CONTRIBUTOR HERE.  BREAK THE MOLD.  >> I'M REALLY CHEAP.  I COME REALLY CHEAP.  >> THAT'S TMI.  I DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING  ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE.  BUT WHAT WE SAW WITH MIKE  JOHNSON, AND DO YOU REMEMBER --  YOU WERE HERE FRIDAY, EMEMBER,  BECKY?  I WAS TALKING WITH JAKE  SHERMAN.  REMEMBER THE LAST SPEAKER?  THAT COMPLETE 15 VOTE MESS WE  WERE IN.?  >> YEAH, WITH McCARTHY.  >> TRUMP, WHERE HE IS, AND HIS,  I MEAN PEOPLE OUT THERE WILL  GET MAD IF I SAY STATURE, BUT  HE DOES HAVE STATURE NOW WITH  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.  AND THE HATERS ARE GOING TO  HATE.  BUT I SAID IT'S GOING TO BE  DIFFERENT THIS TIME.  IS HE GOING TO BE ABLE TO  LITERALLY BE A WHIP AND MAKE  THIS HAPPEN?  BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT  MIKE JOHNSON WAS GOING TO BE 8,  9, 10 VOTES SHORT.  >> NO, IT'S GOING TO WORK.  >> HE MADE TWO PHONE CALLS AND  IT HAPPENED.  >> IT'S GOING TO WORK BECAUSE  AGAIN, YOU HAVE TOM MASSY AND  SOME FOLKS THAT ARE REAL  IDENTIFYO  IDEALOGUES.  KEVIN WAS DEALT A REALLY BAD  HAND.  KEVIN WAS GREAT.  I THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A  REALLY GOOD SPEAKER, BUT KEVIN  WAS DEALT A BAD HAND.  I THINK THE SOLUTION IS THIS.  TRUMP'S GOING TO GET A LOT OF  WHAT HE WANTS, EVEN WITH THIN  MARGINS.  BUT I WERE MASSY AND SOME OF  THESE GUYS THAT WON'T TO VOTE  NO, YOU'VE GOT TO PUT ON PAPER  WHAT YOU WANT.  YOU'VE GOT TO BE CLEAR ON  STRATEGY.  IT CAN'T BE WE WANT COMPLETE  ENTITLEMENT TOMORROW.  THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL.  I THINK THEY ARE PRACTICAL.  I THINK THEY CAN LAY OUT A  STRATEGY AND UNDERSTAND IN  GOVERNMENT YOU CAN'T GET  EVERYTHING YOU WANT.  >> GOVERNOR McCARTHY WAS HERE  YESTERDAY.  OBVIOUSLY HE'S STILL SMARTING  WITH WHAT THEY PUT HIM THROUGH.  THEY'RE NEGLECT SHOUTING  NEGOTIATING FOR THEIR OWN  INTEREST.  >> IF YOU WANT HIM ON A  COMMITTEE, PUT HIM ON A  COMMITTEE.  >> YOU IRRITATE THE REST OF THE  CAUCUS, WHO HAS BEEN THERE  SUPPORTING YOU.  >> I THINK THE BIGGEST  OPPORTUNITY FOR CONGRESS IS --  AND I'M A BELIEVER IN DOGE.  I'M A BELIEVER IN WHAT THEY'RE  TRYING TO DO FUNDAMENTALLY.  IF THEY NIP AROUND THE EDGES ON  A PROGRAM HERE, OR A PROGRAM  THERE, STOP WASTING OUR TIME.  THEY'VE GOT TO SAY WE'RE GOING  TO GIVE THE MONEY AND THE  CONTROL BACK TO THE STATES.  WE UNDERSTAND WHAT FEDERALISM  IS ALL ABOUT.  WE'RE GOING TO LEAN INTO THOSE  IDEALS.  I THINK TRUMP BELIEVES THAT.  I THINK THE DOGE FOLKS BELIEVE  IN THAT.  I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS IN  CONGRESS BELIEVE THAT, AND  ESPECIALLY THE SENATORS.  THERE'S OPPORTUNITY THERE.  AGAIN, YOU JUST CAN'T GET  EVERYTHING YOU WANT AT  LIGHTNING SPEED.  I DO THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENT  HAND BEING DEALT TO JOHNSON  THAN THERE WAS TO KEVIN.  KEVIN WAS UNFAIRLY DEALT WITH,  UNFORTUNATELY.  I THINK THE SPEAKER AND TRUMP  WILL HAVE A LOT MORE CACHE.  THERE WAS NO TRUMP.  TRUMP WAS OUT THERE AS A GUY  RUNNING.  WE THINK HE'S GOING TO WIN OR  MAYBE NOT, WHO KNOWS.  BUT HE WASN'T IN THERE TODAY.

        ">>> the feds top banking  regulator, michael barr will  step down from his position  next month.  that will pave the way for  president-elect trump to name a  position for that job.  bank stocks rallying after that  announcement.  take a look.  bank of america shares up by  1.4%.  citigroup up by 1.5%, and j.p.  morgan and chase up by 0.4%.  joining us now is michael  walker.  this is a pretty big deal for  the financial stocks, brian.  why don't you walk us through  exactly what happened here.  this is a situation where barr  is stepping down from that  oversight position.  he's still going to be a  governor on the bank.  and i guess that means that  incoming president trump will  have to choose someone who's  already on that federal reserve  board for who comes next in  supervision?  >> correct.  yes.  so with barr stepping down with  his leadership post by staying  at the board, that restricts  who the president -- president- elect with choose to fill the  leadership spot..  there is no opening yet on the  board.  probably won't be until next  year.  you look around the board  members.  there are three republican  appointees being obviously the  chairman, governor waller and  governor bowman.  governor bowman who has been  active and outspoken on  regulatory issues seems to be  the obvious choice.  there's no guarantee.  but to me it looks like  governor bowman would be the  likely and logical successor to  vice chairman barr.  >> so we saw the financial  stocks up on this.  the bank stocks up higher on  this news.  what are the implications with  barr stepping away?  what does it mean for the  oversight that's been in place  for the rules that have been  proposed?  >> look at his title, vice  chairman for supervision.  he runs the division of  supervision and regulation,  those are two issues that are  very connected.  supervision i would argue,  you're going can to see the  most immediate impact, but this  will be behind the scenes.  this is how bank examiners go  about their jobs of overseeing  the banks for which they're  responsible.  you can have changes to that,  behind the scenes on day one.  so i think you're going to see  a more benign supervisory  environment for banks on march  1 as soon as the replacement  takes over, whenever that is.  then you have the regulation  aspect.  let me back up.  on the supervisory side, you're  going to have m and a as well.  the head of superadvice  oversees the vetting of merger  applications.  i think you will see a quicker  process that's probably going  with to be more beneficial for  smaller banks.  there will be some questions  for regional banks.  how big will the regulators  approve new mergers?  that's going to be an ongoing  debate, but i think it's going  to be a little easier for them.  but then, just onto the  regulatory side.  the actual rewriting of the  rules.  and the end game, the capital  rules which would propose after  silicon valley's collapse in  2023, it's been on hold for a  while, the chairman powell has  been saying they're going to  make significant revisions.  i think it probably gets a  total rewrite.  some people would argue it's  going to go away all together.  i'm not so sure.  i think there's a very good  chance it comes back, but in a  way that is capital neutral,  which is supposed to be how it  was do",

        "Will phase in a more  comprehensive community notes  system. >> all right. Joining us right now is dan  flack. He is the senior  research analyst. He said he makes it sound like  it is legacy media's fault for  what they were doing. What do you think of the  changes? is this a fair and accurate  reflection after the elections  and results? >> good morning, becky. I think the company is trying to figure out a better way to  balance the respecting of all  different iews across the  spectrum versus trying to remove some of the pernicious content. I think we will see how the  changes play out. I think this is a journey that  they and others will constantly  make tweaks and adjustments. I think the most important thing if we step back is are they able to generate value for users on  one side and value for the  advertisers on the other. So, looking ahead as they make  some changes here, if we see,  for example, the level of  pernicious content and hate  speech picks up meaningfully and advertising pulls back, i expect course corrections. I think we're in a new phase  here to zuckerberg's comments  with the change in the  administration here, i think  meta is responding and trying to look at things a little bit  differently. It will take time though. >> is -- look, this is a work in progress trying to find out and  look at it as a social  experiment and probably always  has been with facebook even  before meta platforms. It's a new form of media and new reality and new way of dealing  with things. Does it surprise you at all to  do this? is this something wall street  wanted to see happen? >> i think wall street is  looking for meta to continue to  evolve its policies. Clearly, if you have human  oversight which is too biassed  for and moving too far to one  side, that is not appropriate. Keep in mind, of course,  different communities and  different countries and  different markets that meta  operates in have a variety of  different political and other  view appointments. Points. I think to your earlier point,  there is a continued role for  so-called legacy media. I think what we're seeing here  is just this continued evolutio  there's a continued role for so  called legacy media.  what we're seeing is a  continued evolution of all the  different platforms to pull in  different bits of content from  different places.  they're going to have to do a  better job on making sure all  voices are heard.  at the same time, the platform  has to be safe, where users can  share and bring more of their  time to it.  if they're able to do that  successfully, the company can  continue to grow.  >> that was going to be my  question to you, dan.  which is to say, i think there  is some community of folks who  are very happy with the way x  is playing out the variety of  content you can see there.  there's other folks who say  it's too much.  that there's stuff it there,  and i occasionally will open  it, and it's complicated,  especially if you have kids.  facebook has not been that, at  least for the last couple of  years.  at least they've tried to avoid  that.  the question is what does it do  to the user experience on one  end, but on the other end, what  does it do to any regulation?  >> for the user experience,  there's a large cohort of users  that will be happy with a lot  less direct oversight from the  company and the traditional  methods its used.  for others, andrew, i would  expect there to be concerns  about divisive content.  i think you're always going to  have that push and pull across  meta and the different  platforms and broadly speaking,  i think the importance of free  speech is obviously critical,  and broadly speaking, these  platforms need to remain  healthy environments for people  top engage.  x has a different set of issues  in terms of trying to surface  content.  obviously ender the ownership  of elon musk, he's continued to  make changes.  we'll see how that plays out.  if i think about where this is  going, it's going to be about  will meta be able to add value  in areas like generative a.i.  and evolve the user experience.  even with the new boundaries as  it were around peech.  i don't think this dramatically  changes things in the near  term.  what will matter, though, as i  look out over the next 6 to 12  months and beyond is whether  this is going to be viewed as a  vibrant safe place for users.  then, of course the  advertisers.  x has struggled with some of  the advertisers going  elsewhere, and were meta to see  a problem with some of their  big advertisers, both here in  the united states and more  broadly globally, then they  could change course.  >> that's interesting.  this company has been caught i",

        ">> happy new year, frank.  >> we are touching on the  disruption from musk and a new  administration in the u.s. And  potential tariffs. How do you see that impacting  the markets? >> european markets have in a  way priced in most of these  uncertainties through the  underperformance in the second  half the last year. This is our base case and what  we've done with our global  allocation in the fourth quarter of last year was to move europe  as a tentative overweight as a  diversifier from the very  one-way positioning just into  the u.s. And nothing else. Recently, it started to work  somehow, right? europe has been going through  lots of political, geopolitical  pressure starting with the  french election announcements. That, in our view, has brought  in the price now. Very recently, we upgraded our  country allocation france to  overweight  overweight. Speaking of continuing on the  political risks you started  with, germany snap election is a step in the right direction in  our view. It will come with corporate tax  cuts with the regulation and  easier labor markets. What's not to like when you're  corporate. >> interesting. I remember during the french  snap elections, that was the  reason to see declines in  european equities. Now the german snap election is  a positive. I want to go to the view on the  stoxx 600. You gave us the price target for the stoxx 600 is 570. Pretty much 10% upside. I looked our cnbc strategist  survey. The average outlook for the s&p  500 this year is 6643. Basically a 10% upside. I want to ask you, do you think  the opportunity in the u.s. And  european markets are even right  now? one reason for the divergence is the u.s. Tech. The fact that the u.s. Has the  very big tech companies with the a.i. Trade. What equals things out this  year? we haven't seen some big surge  with the european tech  companies. >> there is one thing which will equal it out. That is the broadening of eps. On the top of this political  pressure that we spoken about  already, europe has under  performed since the french  election has been announced  because of downgrades to the  eps. So, from being the most upgraded eps market in the world in the  first half of the year, it ended up being the most downgraded  market, right? within the region and within  european equities, there are  many sectors that actually have  undergone eps recessions. In the u.s., the eps hasn't been downgraded at all. Mag seven has been upgraded, the rest have been downgraded by a  similar range as european index. So the driver of out performance and the out performance of the  eps in the u.s. Last year has  been mag seven has been a.i.,  right? into this year, the expectation  is for these stocks to still  grow substantially, but not as  much as last year and for the  rest of the index in the u.s. To start picking up. That is broadening of the eps. In europe, because of the  recessionary levels with the  negative numbers last year, we  see almost all of the sectors  picking up positive growth rate  this year. So, ther",

        "You can see, a little bit of  green. See how long that lost on the  markets and what options are  saying, let's bring in amy wu  silverman at rbc capital  markets. We don't want it to be obvious. It is, but it's so important and it's the beginning of the year. Seasonality plays a big part in  how options behave and how  markets behave. >> it totally does. I agree. It feels obvious, but it doesn't end up what happens. Joe, when you just look  seasonally the last 5, 10, 15,  20 years, january is not a good  month with vix rises and market  selloffs. I like to joke it has a little  bit to do with new year's  resolutions. The portfolio managers will say  we will be more disciplined  and  cautious and three months later, fomo kicks in. Not as much as a sanguine  outlook.  >> i tried to talk about  resolutions at the beginning of  the show. No one wanted to talk about  them. You are bringing them up which  affects trading because even  market participants in the way  they trade, they start the year  and it lasts how long? ten days? i think --  >> the same as the average diet  or exercise plan. >> if you look it up where  people give up on their new  year's resolutions. You do point out that the risk  has not been a market selloff,  but missing out on upside. That's the way it has been. Is that the way it's going to  be? >> so, every year, we get  another 20% rally in the s&p. I would say the baseline makes  that a little bit tougher. I wouldn't count it out. One thing post-covid is the  right-tail risk has been just as serious as the left-tail risk. You throw into this year, the  deregulation potentially around  cryptocurrency and financial  regulation and i think if you  look at the consensus narrative  right now among derivative  strategists, volatility is too  low. I'm not saying i disagree with  that. I'm saying we have to continue  to pay attention to the right  tail because when that spirals,  you get the volatility up just  like in 2023 and just like 2024. To me, those odds are  structurally different now than  they were pre-covid. >> quitters day is coming up  this friday. Second friday in january where  people traditionally give up or  most frequently because they  haven't thought through the  longer term implications. I can do this for a week or two. >> options traders, too. >> we will see that in earnings  season. The benchmark fomo need to  participate starts to overweigh  the valuation discipline. One big theme everybody is  talking about the market breadth widening. We are still suffering through  the paddling duck. So, that index level volatility  continues to look calm and your  vix isn't signaling much, but  you throw donald trump into the  mix and the changes in fiscal  policy and i think that  dispersion will impact the  market.  >> mergers and cquisitions are  probably going to be back. You say at this point it's not  priced in the options market. Why not? why is this not priced in? should it be? is the option market right and  it shouldn't be? >> i think this is one of the  most interesting opportunities  in options and one of the  reasons i think it hasn't been  priced in is the last time you  saw a big m&a wave was 2010. It is like the wheels are rusty  for those who haven't gotten on  the bike in a long time t. Time. It isn't the themes every year. Had a down side looks to the  upside. Neither is pricing in any wave  of m&a. We have been talking about it  for a while. You can use the options strategy to potentially play m&a.  >> it's coming? >> it's not priced in, but if it does come, that's the  opportunity to use leverage. >> let's go back so i understand it a little bit better. The divergence between the  volatility in equities versus  rates. Can you explain that to me so i  understand it better? >> yeah, so, when you look at  all different instruments, you  have treasury volatility and you can use the equity volatility  for that. We measure the ratios of those  divergence. Meaning, when you see equity  volatility pretty sanguine, but  rates volatility is high, we're  talking about the same market. Somebody is right and somebody  is wrong. One of the reasons we like to  use those cross asset metrics is you could argue rates is driving everything. Rates isn't just driving the  rates market. Rates is driving every single  market. The big question is why is the  rates market saying there's more volatility uncertainty ahead  relative to the equity market. When you back test that over  time, someone is right and  someone is wrong. It is not always t",

        "Rein security chair.  i would give you first crack.  there was a store in the  washington post, suggesting  this would not be brought  tariffs that they would be more  targeted.  it would be every country, but  it would be targeted at issues  that are important to the  economy or national security.  the incoming president himself  pushed back against that.  what does it mean?  what does that mean for global  trade?  >> good morning, good to be  with you.  president trump had stated that  america needs to impose global  tariffs to correct a widespread  distortion in the markets.  these are distortions that stem  from china that have destroyed  prices across the global market. Absolutely, this is not a  sector specific approach.  china's distortions and he  impact in the market have been  so widespread that global  tariffs are absolutely  warranted.  the president will pursue  widespread, global tariffs on  imported goods.  there are a number of legal  authorities that he can use to  impose them.  all tariffs will be want to  correct for trade distortions  and will be appropriate under  the law.  >> do you believe that this is  something that will be  implemented as such?  is this something that will be  used to negotiate better  situations on a country by  country, or industry basis?  >> i have that question a lot.  the purpose of the tariffs are  to correct for distortions.  the goal of tariffs is not to  keep them on goods indefinitely. Is to impose them to correct  for distortions.  once the trading partners  decide to eliminate harmful  trade practices, we want free  trade, but the trump  administration was fair trade.  the imposition of tariffs  correct for distortions.  was trading partners decide to  remove distortions, the tariffs  can be removed.  it is a negotiating tool.  the premises to correct for  distortions and compel the  imposition of tariffs for the  trading partners to remove the  trading practices and make the  economy star.  our economy is being weekend  because the trading partners  are taking advantage of the  u.s. Is pre-borders to distort  in the u.s. Market and the  global market.  >> that sounds like a perfectly  reasonable argument to come  through.  in reality, there are questions  about whether it can be done  that easily and other countries  will go along and say you are  right, this is not right, and  we will change things.  what you think?  >> hold on just a second, i  don't think we are hearing your  audio.  and we double checked.  >> you are right, we have  distortions, we visited abroad  that others don't is here to  the extent, president trump can  use a variety of policies and  tools, including tariffs to  correct for that, that would be  great.  one hing that president trump  did campaign on his lowering  inflation.  tariffs will make it harder to  do that.  it will be that much more  important to cut government  spending, physical discipline,  boosting productivity and an  energy abundant policy as he  has also talked about.  can be used as a negotiating  tool?  yes.  does it work?  sometimes, yes, as we have seen  in the past, especially with  president trump and japan in  agriculture.  it can lead to retaliation. It  could work, and it could lead  to a global trade war.  there are distortions out there  that we do need to address.  >> yes.  for market watching this  closely and business leaders  watching this closely, the  question becomes, how far will  this be pushed?  how far is this a hill that the  administration is willing to  die on?  if it comes back in the form of  much higher inflation.  if it starts pressuring that.  i will ask you first, is there  a point where we say we are  more concerned about making  sure americans are not paying a  lot more than making sure  everything works out fairly?  >> that is a fair question.  i have been doing trade policy  and tariffs for 25 years,  right?  what we often see, and more and  more again, when you put  tariffs, and makes the domestic  industry stronger.  not only on shore with domestic  manufacturing, but it increases  wages.  the idea that we will just have  inflation by this imposition  does not take into account the  reality that wages will  increase.  yes, will goods be more  expensive?  potentially, but the rising  prices is the effect of  correcting for distortions.  people get more money so they  can pay for price increases.  the other thing i want to  underscore, in the first trump  administration when i surf,  when we about tariffs, we did  not have that level of  retaliation.  the trade commission did a  study, they noted that the  effect of inflation from the  first-term tariffs were  infinitesimal, if anything at  all.  we also saw that the trading  partners did not retaliate.  they got into trading  agreements with the united  states to remove the  distortions and tariffs on  steel and aluminum.:compel  countries to impose their own  measures to protect themselves  from china's overcapacity apple  exports from the united states  where they were flooding the  united states due to the  secondary effects of  overcapacity in china.  what we see over and over again  are increase wages, no  inflation, and corrections i  trading partners to remove  trade distortions that are  hurting the u.s. Economy.  need to look no further than  the trump administration to see  how that will play out once  again.  finally, i will add, and the  first of administration, the  imposed tax cuts to offset the  initial shock to the markets of  the imposition of tariffs, he  has talked about tax cuts again. I think that will be  forthcoming to help the  transition period the  administration imposes more  tariffs.  for no question, we don't want  dumping here when it comes to  steel and automobiles.  we don't want dumping from  subsidized industries coming  here and disrupting things.  there is an entire school  thought that if you rotect  yourself from competition with  other countries, companies will  not be as lean or as efficient  as they could be or should be  otherwise.  you also ave the issue of  thinking that we can push our  partners on things, but maybe  your trading partners on  things, but if we are picking  an america first, nationalistic  view on every single issue,  digging in the case of japan,  where we had very good things  that we have that we worked out  with japan last time with  agriculture and working on the  tariffs, now we are telling  japan that nippon steel cannot  come here and invest  in a u.s.  company and spend money here.  is there a point where there is  a little bit too much pushing  the goes on?  do you think this makes for  better deals?  >> there is always there.  first of all, tariffs to raise  prices to what extent is  questionable. Especially for  the downstream industries. We  cannot just brush that off.  the idc study, and others  definitely showed the price  increases.  it was not disastrous.  that said, can it be used as a  tool for reciprocity, yes.  in some cases, president trump  to that in agriculture.  look, there is no perfect world. Hopefully we will get closer to  that over the next 3 years.  whether or not we will ever get  to a  -for-tat or one-for-one  reciprocity , you don't want to  hold out for that until the  very end, and then you do  yourself in.  you get the situation where you  close yourself off to  competition, like the deal with  nippon steel, do not think that  is over yet.   it was an interesting potential  opportunity for u.s. Steel to  get an injection of capital and  technology and managerial  expertise that could help them  to be sustainable moving  forward.  if tariffs work, the steel  industry would be booming right  now.  they have had decades and  decades of a lot of tear  production and a lot of variety  of other protection from import  competition.  if tariffs works, we wouldn't  have the declining steel  industry.  keep that in mind.  will the tariffs be disastrous?  probably not.  they will not be without cost.  they do help to save some jobs  in those protective factors.  everybody else that buys those  goods have to pay higher  prices.  it is not a free lunch.  it never is.  trump says he wants reciprocity  and trade relationships, that ",

See you in a little bit. >>> it has been a year since the door plug blowout from the  boeing 737 max 9 which was  operated by alaska airlines. Rob epstein is joining us. It's an odd anniversary to be  celebrating. I guess it's an excuse for us to talk to you, ron. I'm sure boeing doesn't want to  celebrate this anniversary that  it's been a year. Let's look back. There have been -- there has  been a response to that. That seemed like it wasn't the  only thing that happened. Maybe it was the straw that  broke the camel's back or maybe  not. What progress has been made by  boeing since then? >> when you think about what's  going on at boeing, they got a  new ceo. Kelly ortberg is in the process  of bringing in new talent,  executive talent. When you think about boeing,  longer term and shorter term,  longer term, what's on  investors' minds is one,  changing the culture, two,  fixing the production and  innovation. One of the things we're watching around culture is boeing defense right now has an interim leader  and doing a search for boeing  defense. Let's see who they hire. That might be a strong indicator how culture change is at the  company. Shorter term, investors are  thinking about and this happened the past two years, do we want  to be long airplane producers or parts producers. The long bet was airplane  producers, but parts producers  won that. That debate is going on in the  market. We are hosting the bank of  america forum where we talk  about supply chain issues and do you want to be long the airplane makers or parts makers.  >> the culture change proceeded  the guy ortberg replaced. The culture issues you talked  about that need changing. This is a decade at least. So re all of the problems. How long the problems go back? the software? >> if you go back 2019. Culture won't change overnight. There's no way it will.  >> talk about changing culture.  >> for sure. For sure. >> that was just the most recent total fiasco, the door plug. What's -- you think it's over in terms of shoes dropping? it was a ipede. Centipede. >> the door wasn't bolted on. The faa is inn expecting them  closer. This gets back to the  stableation of the production  process. We watch closely what's going on there. Our hope and expectation is they will stabilize at a lower  production rate. We are forecasting this year  they will deliver on acknowledge off the production line about 31 airplanes. We row are hoping to end the ye  with 38. That's something we watch  closely. The faa is looking for quality. It gets back to quality  management on the production  system. That all gets back to culture. That doesn't change overnight. We don't expect to change  overnight. This is stuff that's gone back  over the last 15 or 20 years. I would expect to take five or  ten years to change.  >> i guess boeing's been able to live off its phenomenal  reputation and, you know, known  for quality for how many years? how long has the company been in business? >> over 100 years.  >> with all of the issues we  talked about. The jets we think about. We wouldn't get on them if we  didn't think they were safe. They are. You talk about one in 8 million. Still too many when you are  talking about that. You think the culture is  changing. You think ortberg is the right  person? >> we are seeing changes in the  right direction. It's early innings.  >> it's still early? >> yeah. >> unbelievable. Five or six or seven years. >> ortberg has only been there a year. Not even a year. It is still early days. For the market to make judgment  on him is too soon. >> the stock topped out at 400? >> yeah. Airbus would have delivered 770  airplanes. Boeing only delivered 340. Part of that is the um  impact   the strike and. You have other producers out  there saying it is time to jump  in.  >> who is the third competitor? >> brazil. You have other startup companies like jet zero looking at blended wing bodies with a different  configuration.  >> that is the game changer to  no longer have a poly. >> chinese. >> you don't want to sell  tencent for gaming. >> the chinese market is a large aircraft market. That's 300 to 400 airplanes a  year. If they supply to themselves,  that is the demand for aircraft  for boeing. >> ron. >> fascinating. >> it is. Normally -- you know, i like a  bunch of safe jets. Airbus. They're nice. >> they're all safe. >> go airbus. Give us a bunch of jets. We need to go places.  >> go boeing. >> that's what i'm saying. Usually i say i don't like  seeing airbu",

        "Market is intact, but certain  markets. It is good to talk to  him.  that kind of message, i don't  know.  paul is here, the cofounder of  the spoken investment group.  as for wow, what a welcome.  >> is one thing to say could be  good, but we have so we are  concerned about.  what is on your list?  >> we are optimistic about the  market.  you also to be realistic.  we've had two big years of  gains.  when you look historically, you  look at periods when the bull  market reaches it second year.  historically alas about 5  years, but the 30 years weaker  than average.  we talked on christmas eve  about how the s&p was above the  200 day moving average.  that's only happened a few  other times.  average returns were half the  historical average.  we had over 50 new highs last  year.  in prior years, six other  years, 4 years we were down.  these are things to be aware  of.  overall, the factors of a.i. , what is going on in  washington, and the rotting --  broadening economy, don't think  we'll see another 20% year.  >> i do understand all the  arguments, and where we are  along the lines, everybody  seems to be thinking the same  thing right now, that we cannot  possibly have another year like  last year.  as for everybody talked about  how the first few days of the  year would be weak because he  worsening i gains.  we are up 1.5%.  historically, that has been a  relatively good omen.  you have to have some balance.  when it comes to washington, it  is interesting when you look at  what is going on.  all we hear about is  uncertainty there is an  uncertainty that.  there is always uncertainty in  the markets.  we are all aware of that.  in the last several weeks of  the year, people started to  underestimate the potential  positives of the new  administration.  what you saw on the continuing  resolution was passed, and you  saw mike johnson get reelected  as a speaker on the first  ballot, the market with two of  the best days since the  election were those days.  maybe the markets are  underestimating what can get  done going forward, as far as  less of the regulatory burden  and lower taxes.  that could be a positive  surprise going forward.  >> are you still in the double  digits at the end of this year,  or we are up?  if not double digits?  >> i think we will be up, but i  don't think it will be like the  last 2 years.  i'm not be surprised if we were  down 5% or up 5%.  nothing surprises me these days. The alternatives to the stock  market are weaker.  for that is the question.  for we stay invested we are  reining in expectations.  >> are fully invested were  waiting for something to happen  see keep cash on the silent?  is that number regarding more?  >> where we are, we are still  invested in our positions.  we have not been raising a lot  of cash.  we are starting to diversify  from the growth oriented  sectors of the market to more  cyclical and a value where he  markets.  to give me examples.  as for in the industrial  sector, you will see, if you  see less of the regulatory  burden, some of the big  projects, you will see these  companies benefiting from that.  the higher interest rates that  we have seen in december were a  factor behind the 10% decline.  long-term, we think industrial  sector will do well going  forward.  >> anything you would not  touch?  >> energy is a tough sector.  the economy is doing really  well and oil has rallied a  little bit, but it is well off  its highs.  you went back to the first  administration, was the worst  performing sector, even though ",
