          "Welcome to our video series on generative AI I'm Kevin Boyd the CIO at the University of Chicago and I'm very pleased to have with me today Professor benia a professor in the department of computer science and today we're going to be talking about the future of generative AI so let me ask you we've been uh looking at um so many articles these days that talk about the amazing predictions of what is coming with AI and what the future is going to look like I'm really interested in your perspective on this you know based on based on what you see today what do you think the next big trends are going to be in generative AI wow I mean that's a big question right uh who knows but I think you know from my perspective from a technical perspective I think again people will disagree and a lot of people in machine learning are of two minds um but I personally I think that in some of the architectures that we've been using lately in terms of Transformers and llms and and diffusion models I think we somewhat approaching the plateau of what we can extract from the data that we're getting and and the real bottom neck today is data and you know so much of the models are all about extracting the maximum value out of data but there is only so much data that we have in on Earth in the world and and most of it's already being fed and so I think the expansion now is going to be broad broadly speaking into different applications and that's going to be interesting to see what does happen and which applications don't do turn out to be really useful and applicable um but in terms of just raw power and sort of Amazement I think that really exciting sort of bump was perhaps you know what we just saw in the last few months um but now we're going to sort of get used to some of the things that we're seeing and and that's going to become more sort of DED life interesting um I I guess is the do you think it's sustainable though is this is this something that um maybe the curve is flattening out but are we going to keep seeing um Innovations in the AI field will we be back here having this conversation 10 years from now do you think you know again I think it's a it's a very difficult thing to predict because um it really does depend on what we think right now where the value is in terms of these models I mean I think there are folks who are thinking about you know artificial sort more general intelligence and reasoning but really we're still quite a distance away from that and and right now the architectures we have are still very dependent on the data that we have so if that does hold true then just because we're really getting most of the data in the world already into these models we're going to be sort of slowing down a little bit but if we do have breakthroughs if we do have a way to for example you know design new versions of reinforcement learning that don't require sort of new influx of data then things will change dramatically and um whether that happens you know who knows there's a lot of people very smart people working in the space and so yeah exciting to see you mentioned data a couple times um is there something we should be doing or thinking about differently with data today you know I think there's just a lot of things going on in terms of how we think about data right now and and how we're changing the way that we think about data um you know 20 years ago I was still in grad school when I you know remember the peer-to-peer days I was dealing with music and intellectual property and so on and and of course that's all sort of coming back back again in terms of can anyone use anything on the internet for any reason right and so the courts the legal system the regulatory agencies are figuring that out um but in general that is I think perhaps the biggest deciding factor of how we proceed forward is who owns data and and how much data goes into these models is really going to determine in my opinion how fast these models grow and what is the future that of they can of the things that they can do um you know they can always sort of expanding the new applications I think that is almost certainly going to happen um and it really does come down to the Ingenuity of applying different models to the right applications to where you know you minimize errors and you really maximize the value and the ease of use of that sort of speech interface for example interesting um let's talk a little bit about um how the future may change for jobs it's uh it's interesting how often I hear people say well my job in the future is going to to be taken over by Ai and that's usually followed by a laugh but what do you think is is uh is that going to happen for a lot of people you know unfortunately I think so um you know I I wrote a little answer to a to a question back in 2017 when before all this stuff came around and and my concern back then was that we weren't going to be ready for the job replacement the the ginormous displacement of jobs that we're going to see from Ai and unfortunately right now AI as it is is not displacing the kind of jobs that we would like to displace um we don't have a lot of robots that doing the really tough jobs for us instead we're having software do this kind of thinking and generation and writing and those kind of things are relatively speaking you know a little bit more attractive on the scale of physical labor versus mental tasks and so um yeah it would be really great to see some of the more robotic things I know there's a lot of exciting Innovations in there uh constantly but to see that space sort of catch up and to really get to the point where we can have you know was it the Jetson that had you know household you know robots chasing after you clean the house I mean I think everybody would love one of those at their home I would love a robot like that so so let's talk a little bit about the broader societal impacts of this um it feels like AI keeps popping up in more and more places in the consumer World um I was online creating an - greeting card and at the end of the process it said well would you like to use AI to generate the message you know and and that sort of thing seems to just keep popping up in more and more places talk to me a little bit about how you think this will impact society change um the the day-to-day of society yeah you know that's super interesting because I think we're at an inflection point where if you look at the sci-fi novels that you know some of the great authors wrote 50 60 years ago we're starting to getting to that point where we think about what we value in terms of Being Human and what is humanity and so there are lots of things that we can replace and the question is do we want to replace them and I think we're seeing some of that play out right now in the marketplace a lot of people who consume books and art and so on are already making a very explicit uh statement about preferring human generated content and so that is something that I think you know if you look at like sci-fi dystopian Futures you know where everything's free or everything's cheap accept the human labor aspect of it I think we're perhaps turning that corner and that will be interesting to see because I think valuing human Ingenuity and creativity is really important and in the future AI is going to be everywhere perhaps and it will generate lots of things that are you know very commoditized and readily available and what will be in demand or what will be in short supply is actual human creativity and engineuity so I think we're going to turn that corner and that value sort of system is going to flip on its head um and that's going to be interesting to see so we're seeing that play out right now you know and a lot of companies are basically trying to figure out where the line is right they're trying to say AI everything and that's fine and but the consumer and Society in general is going to make a decision about okay this is what we valued this was what we really prize above all and that value system and that reaction is going to come back and the companies will figure out how to adapt and and to figure out the right sort of bifurcation so I think that's really interesting and um I think it's going to be very fascinating to watch how that line shifts um my own experience has been Sometimes using these tools in the in the more the consumer realm um sometimes the reaction has been wildly positive someone's like oh that was such a heartfelt message and I'm thinking it it was probably better than I might have written myself but it was AI um and that takes us into some ethical considerations um there are so many different ethical dimensions of AI talk to me a bit about how you think about this wow where do we start I mean you know I I think there are a lot of potentials for misuse of AI um I think you know starting from sort of the creation of these models and the training data and respect and consent for intellectual property I think a lot of those questions are being worked out through the court and the regulatory systems but I think you know regardless of how you think they got here the models themselves are very powerful and they are really need the regulation right so if you think about just sort of image generation and the ability to create photos that look absolutely real but yet never happened our Fabrications so there's a lot of implications on how we think about reality and how we perceive our senses and what is information and evidence and disinformation so that I think is going to be something that we're going to be dealing with as a society for quite some time right I mean we've been dealing with dis information outline for a while but this is going to take it to a whole new level where you literally cannot trust your young ears and eyes and so you know how we deal with that in society how we talk to you know members of our own family and authenticate each other on a daily basis I mean there's going to be some really crazy behavioral impact as well um so you know some of that can be really controlled and and limited by Regulatory Agencies and and and uh and governments I think you know the EU is taking some of these early steps that will really be interesting to see how that Fallout impacts the industry and how we uh react to it it may not be enough or it may be too much but I think you know that type of uh figuring out in real time is what we're going to see for a lot of different aspects of society I believe there's already been a case where a uh presidential election in Eastern Europe was um impacted by what appeared to be AI generated content it's going to be very interesting to see how this plays out in the upcoming US election yeah boy there are some real concerns right I think we already saw I think there was a a a def fake voice call uh pretending to be Biden I think it was in Maine I don't if I remember correctly uh these things are going to keep popping up and I think uh technology has to adapt we have to have better protection over uh human voices our own likenesses um you know it used to be it was already the case that we would talk to our kids about you know managing their online presence very carefully but now it's going to be even more critical as they grow up because they are going to be that generation of you know do we want samples of our voice online do we want people to be able to download original undoctored version of our voices because who knows there could be you know digital avatars of us that we don't intend to be out there and that generation is really going to reach the sort of consequences of all the things that we're deciding and inventing right now so thinking about the upcoming generation you and I both obviously work at a university um we get some frequent questions from students and parents um asking all right so what should the Next Generation be majoring in what should they be thinking about to both protect themselves from Ai and also prepare themselves for AI what are your thoughts on that it's such a tough question I've had that question a lot every time I give a talk on AI and and and jobs and and so on um you know I I don't know that we can really predict the future in a clear way because all this stuff is going to fall out in ways that we can't predict so what I would say is you know a liberal arts education is probably as important as ever um being able to adapt being able to be well-versed in different disciplines you know ethics and philosophy are coming back huge that's just ginormous implications of how you make decisions in this ethical landscape right um but also technology of course in science and so uh yeah I would just say be broad you know don't depend on any one thing because you don't know what the job landscape is going to be and being versatile with the liberal arts education is going to be really critical that's great advice um staying in the education track for a minute how do you think educa how do you think education may be changed by AI is is it all going to be personalized learning in the future oh boy you know I think we're dealing with some of that right now and you know um lots of meetings trying to figure out like how do you evaluate students accurately how do you discourage you know um Behavior or plagiarism or anything like that um you know it's it's a real big looming question uh and I think there will be some technological tools technological tools to help um but also we just have to change the way that we teach and and we have to change our value system and students themselves have to understand that there are going to be these tools and do they want to take advantage of them this is coming back to the calculator days of you know yes you can do all the numbers on the calculator but you know um of course things are more complicated right lmms are not as reliable they can you know uh sort of give you wrong answers so they're worse than something like a calculator but it's St quandry of how do you teach the value of education and how do you teach students to understand what do they want to learn versus what do they have to learn um and so I think we as educator Al obviously have to cater our curriculum to to encourage the active learning aspect uh and to really perhaps you know leave the the the the root learning the the the busy work side of things to llms and and generators that's great we've touched on a few things um like the the ethical considerations of AI the um potential impact of AI on um political campaigns deep fakes and the like that sound to me like they may be right for reg for regulation or that uh um I uh individuals are thinking about regulation can you talk a little bit about what you think might be coming or what you're hearing might be coming in the uh in the area of Regulation around AI yeah I think we're still sort of early days in that process obviously um a lot of regulators and legislators are still being educated about what this is what it can do and what it can't do um so that that's going to take a little bit of time but I think you know we're seeing some regulatory actions taking place in the EU I think there's a lot of uh legislative efforts in state governments right now um it's a little bit easier a little bit more local and organized in Illinois and California in New York and some other states there are now different Bills going forth uh sort of working on accountability of AI working on restrictions of AI when it can and cannot be used working on how to develop and and think about ethical Ai and its impact some of them are specifically looking at different applications like in the medical space or Healthcare others are looking at education others so yeah people are really working on this from all different aspects and so I think it's going to be great to see a lot of this come to fruition and of course the industry itself will adapt uh it will have to as always you know when you have a new industry pop up you you learn what the regulatory landscape looks like and what you can and cannot do and and you adapt and so I think yeah the industry will change quite a bit you know a lot of the initial marketing of what you know can and cannot do will change as people get a littleit more realistic about what are the AC applications that are really going to take shape and how we really benefit Society with some of these tools that's great so I'd like to close by um giving you a fairly broad question what do you think is the most exciting um possible future for AI and what would you say is the most concerning possible future for AI you know the that's such a wde that is such a wide range right um I don't think we're going to see AGI uh I'm not one of these people who thinks that we're going to be dealing with a Terminator or or those kind of things but I do think on the negative side that you know it we are our own Worse Enemy right these are powerful tools that misuse we can wreak all sorts of habit with them with elections with attacks with you know disre respect for human likeness and and identity and all these things so you know regul regulations and legal actions will have to take place there technical tools uh like some of the things we're developing here will come have a have a sort of say in things um on the exciting positive side of things I think you know um I think just language and speech is really exciting I think the fact that you know every single one of us deals with language and speech and and communication is such an important part so just to have a system that you know provides a much richer language interface I think will change everything it's something that's tangible that we all deal with and and it's going to benefit all of us uh in some way and you know we don't need it to necessarily write books or write fantastic essays you know I think we still need some work there uh but I think just you know having a much richer language and vocabulary and being able to put a nice interactive voice wrapper around all the devices that we have today I think that's going to be something that really tangibly changes everyone's lives um and as long as you don't ask too much of these models I think they're going to be okay you don't don't ask don't ask for specific facts or dates and things like that but you know just as an interactive like agent and and having that layer I think is going to be a really big positive for a lot of people in different Industries I like that you worked in the Terminator reference that a glad that you think it's probably not around the corner that's great all right well thank you so much Professor Benjo really appreciate you uh being here with me today um and thank you for joining us for uh one of our segments about generative AI I'm Kevin void at the University of Chicago and thank you [Music]",

          "I'd love to start with these. 10 years of workÂ \nright there. Someone on your team called theseÂ Â  the real life Tony Stark glasses. Very hardÂ \nto make each one of these... That makes me feelÂ Â  incredibly optimistic... In a world where AIÂ \ngets smarter and smarter... This is probablyÂ Â  going to be the next major platform afterÂ \nphones... I miss hugging my mom. Yeah hapticsÂ Â  is hard... How does generative AI changeÂ \nhow social media feels?... We haven't foundÂ Â  the end yet... The average American has fewerÂ \nfriends now than they did 15 years ago. WhyÂ Â  do you think that's happening? I meanÂ \nthere's a lot going on to to unpack there... I'm about to interview Meta CEO\nMarkÂ Zuckerberg. There are notÂ Â  that many people with more power over what ourÂ \nfuture might look like. Nearly half the total humanÂ Â  population now uses Meta products and I justÂ \ntested some of their new tech that feels likeÂ Â  science fiction. This is crazy! Mark Zuckerberg andÂ \nthe team at Meta are imagining a future that billionsÂ Â  of other people might actually end up living in. SoÂ \nmy goal for this conversation is to try to figureÂ Â  out what that future really looks like. To paint aÂ \npicture of the future Mark Zuckerberg is trying toÂ Â  build so that you can decide for yourself what youÂ \nthink of it. Welcome to the first episode of ourÂ Â  new series, Huge Conversations Hey, goodÂ to meet you! Thanks\nfor doing this. Yeah looking forwardÂ Â  to it. Awesome. I'd love to tell you what my goalÂ \nis of this conversation. Go for it. We have a calledÂ Â  huge if true which is this very optimistic aboutÂ \nscience and technology and the potential futuresÂ Â  that we can build and in every episode we're sortÂ \nof exploring what does it look like if you play aÂ Â  certain technological future out and so my goalÂ \nin this conversation is to try to help peopleÂ Â  see the future that you're imagining when you'reÂ \nbuilding the products that you and the Meta teamÂ Â  are building. What are you imagining this looksÂ \nlike in future? How are you imagining people useÂ Â  this? All of that. Cool. All right awesome. SoÂ \nI'd love to start with these. Let's do it. 10 yearsÂ Â  of work right there! I got to demo them a littleÂ \nbit earlier today. I heard someone on your teamÂ Â  call these the real life Tony Stark glasses? We'reÂ \ngetting there. But I'd love to just hear in yourÂ Â  voice what are these? Well these are the first fullÂ \nholographic augmented reality glasses I think thatÂ Â  exist in the world. We've made I think it's aÂ \na few thousand or something right. Very hard toÂ Â  make each one of these but this is the culminationÂ \nof 10 years of research and and development thatÂ Â  we've done to basically miniaturize all theÂ \ncomputing that you need to have glasses not aÂ Â  headset but glasses that can put full hologramsÂ \ninto the world with a wide field of view. So youÂ Â  can imagine sort of in the future we'd be having aÂ \nversion of this conversation where you know maybeÂ Â  I or you are not even here it's like one of us isÂ \nphysically here and the other one is here as a asÂ Â  kind of a full body hologram and it's not justÂ \na video call you can actually interact you canÂ Â  do things I mean in the the demo we had the youÂ \nknow ping pong and games and things like that butÂ Â  I mean you could you can interact you can workÂ \ntogether you can you know play poker play chestsÂ Â  whatever like the holographic cards holographicÂ \nboard game. I just think it's going to be wild. it's going to remake I think so many differentÂ \nfields that we think about today from how we workÂ Â  and productivity to a lot of things around scienceÂ \na lot of things around education entertainment funÂ Â  gaming. But this is just the beginning youÂ \nknow this is the first version, it's aÂ Â  prototype version that we've made in orderÂ \nto develop the next version which is hopefullyÂ Â  going to be the consumer one that we sell toÂ \na lot of people. Why build these? Well I thinkÂ Â  it's going to be the next major computing platform.Â \nSo if you look at like the grand arc of computingÂ Â  over time you've you've gone from like mainÂ \nframes to computers that basically like liveÂ Â  on you know your desk or on a tower to phonesÂ \nthat you have in your hand that you basicallyÂ Â  like you know can take with you everywhere thatÂ \nyou want but it's it's pretty unnatural right itÂ Â  takes you away from the world around you and. IÂ \nthink that the trend in computing is it gets moreÂ Â  ubiquitous it gets more natural and it justÂ \ngets more social right so you want to be ableÂ Â  to interact with people in the world around youÂ \nand I think that this is probably going to beÂ Â  the next major platform after phones. I'll giveÂ \nthese to you. These are the clear ones that showÂ Â  all the... The whole thing is a special edition andÂ \nthis is like a really special edition. There'sÂ Â  not a single millimeter of of space. You knowÂ \neverything in here from the micro projectors thatÂ Â  um basically shoot light into the wave guidesÂ \nright it's a special type of display system. IÂ Â  mean these aren't normal displays like you haveÂ \nin a phone or a TV or computer like the type ofÂ Â  displays that people have been building forÂ \ndecades. It's a waveguide system. The projectorÂ Â  that's shooting light basically goes into theseÂ \nnano etchings across the wave guide that are whatÂ Â  catches and creates the holograms. In order toÂ \nsynchronize that with your where you're lookingÂ Â  there's eye tracking and little cameras,Â \nthey illuminate your eyes and then of courseÂ Â  there's all the basic stuff that you need all theÂ \ncomputing, the batteries to power the whole thing,Â Â  microphones, the speakers because it needs to beÂ \nable to play audio and speak with you and theÂ Â  cameras and sensors to see things around you inÂ \nthe world so that way when it's placing hologramsÂ Â  in the world it can do that in the right placeÂ \nand understand where you are so that probablyÂ Â  is still not covering everything because there'sÂ \na lot of things that need to go into syncing upÂ Â  the holographic images between the two displaysÂ \nbecause you don't just have a single displayÂ Â  like you have in a phone or TV you have two andÂ \nit moves around and you know physical thingsÂ Â  are hard and need to be synced up. There's alsoÂ \nthe radio that has to communicate with your otherÂ Â  computing devices to do heavier computing um andÂ \nthe wrist based neural interface that you probablyÂ Â  got to try out. We kind of miniaturized all of thisÂ \nand fit it into uh you know normal looking pair ofÂ Â  glasses which is... you know when I told the teamÂ \nthat we were going to do this 10 years ago youÂ Â  know people weren't sure if we were going to beÂ \nable to but I think you not only we're goingÂ Â  to be able to do this but I think we're going toÂ \nbe able to get it cheaper and higher quality andÂ Â  even even smaller and more stylish over time. SoÂ \nI think this is going to be a pretty wild future.Â Â  There are so many versions of trying to getÂ \na similar idea of digital objects in physicalÂ Â  space. I'm thinking of for example of glasses thatÂ \nhave heads up displays where it's headlocked andÂ Â  it's moving with my eyes, glasses that are reallyÂ \ncreating digital objects in physical space thatÂ Â  don't move as I move, I'm thinking of these, I'mÂ \nalso thinking of the Snapchat Spectacles that theyÂ Â  just announced, then on the other hand there areÂ \nheadsets like the Quest and also like the AppleÂ Â  Vision Pro that seem to fall into a differentÂ \ncategory. I'm curious how you would organize thisÂ Â  landscape for people and how you think aboutÂ \npeople using these tools in their real livesÂ Â  in the near future? Yeah so when we were gettingÂ \nstarted on this about 10 years ago I thought thatÂ Â  something like this was going to be the ultimateÂ \nproduct for everyone. Right you get to you knowÂ Â  normal looking pair of glasses and we'll continueÂ \nimproving that that can have full holographicÂ Â  images. I think it's super powerfulÂ \nand it is sort of the science fiction future thatÂ Â  I think we all hope to get to. On the journey weÂ \ntook a few other approaches as well um to help usÂ Â  develop towards that including building glassesÂ \nthat don't have displays to try to learn. JustÂ Â  take a stylish pair of glasses today and put asÂ \nmuch technology into it as you can but reallyÂ Â  focus on the form factor and that's the Ray BanÂ \nMeta glasses and it's doing really well andÂ Â  initially we thought that that was sort of introÂ \nproduct for us to learn how to build this but oneÂ Â  of the things that's clear now is you're going toÂ \nbe able to make that product a lot more affordableÂ Â  than this probably permanently. So I actually thinkÂ \nthat there are going to be a bunch of different ofÂ Â  these paths that we've taken are going to beÂ \nkind of permanent product lines that peopleÂ Â  will choose. I think you'll see display-less glassesÂ \nlike the Ray Ban Metas continue to get better andÂ Â  better, great for AI, no display but you can talkÂ \nto it, it can talk back. I think there's going toÂ Â  be something in between these that's basically aÂ \nheads up display, so it's not a 70Â° field of view,Â Â  maybe it's a 20Â° or 30 degree field of view,Â \nso that's not going to be what you want forÂ Â  putting kind of a full hologram of a person orÂ \ninteracting with the world around you but it'sÂ Â  going to be great for you know when you're talkingÂ \nto AI, not just having voice but also being ableÂ Â  to see what it's saying or being able to textÂ \nsomeone with your wrist-based neural interface andÂ Â  then have their text show up rather than having itÂ \nread to you, which is, we read faster than weÂ Â  can listen or getting directions right or justÂ \nbeing able to search for information get all that.Â Â  So there's a lot of value for heads up displayÂ \nthat will be somewhat more expensive than theÂ Â  display-less but somewhat cheaper than this.Â \nThen I think you're going to get this. It's goingÂ Â  to be probably the most premium and and expensiveÂ \nof glasses products but hopefully still somethingÂ Â  that you know like a computer is generallyÂ \naccessible to most people in the world but I thinkÂ Â  that there are going to be all of those and IÂ \nI think people will like them. I also think thatÂ Â  the headsets that people are using around mixedÂ \nreality will continue to be a thing too becauseÂ Â  no matter how good we get at miniaturizingÂ \nthe tech for this you're just going to beÂ Â  able to fit more compute into a full headset.Â \nFundamentally our mission is not you know buildÂ Â  something that is advanced and only a few peopleÂ \ncan use, we want to take it you the last mile andÂ Â  do all the innovation to get it to everyone. WeÂ \nyou know just shipped or announced Quest 3S,Â Â  the new mixed reality headset where we basically areÂ \ndelivering high quality mixed reality for $299.Â Â  I was really proud last year when we deliveredÂ \nQuest 3, the first kind of really high qualityÂ Â  high resolution color mixed reality device forÂ \n$500, right it was like, it's like a fraction ofÂ Â  the cost of of what the competitors are doingÂ \nand I think it's actually higher quality in aÂ Â  lot of ways, and now we've just doubled down onÂ \nthat. So I think that they're all actually goingÂ Â  to end up being important long-term product lines:Â \ndisplay-less, heads up display, full holographicÂ Â  AR, full headsets. I think that they're all goingÂ \nto be important. Yeah. If you play out the futureÂ Â  of not just the hardware that we've been talkingÂ \nabout so Meta Ray Bans, Quest, Orion, but alsoÂ Â  the Llama models, if everything goes according toÂ \nyou and the teams wildest dreams, I'd love forÂ Â  you to just begin to describe what that feels like.Â \nI mean I think that there are two primary valuesÂ Â  that we're trying to bring. On the AR and kind ofÂ \nmixed reality side, the main value we're trying toÂ Â  bring is this feeling of presence .Right so there'sÂ \nsomething that I think is just really deep aboutÂ Â  being physically present with another person thatÂ \nyou don't get from any other technology today andÂ Â  I think that's the thing when people have a veryÂ \nvisceral reaction to experiencing virtual or mixedÂ Â  reality what they're really reacting to is thatÂ \nthey actually for the first time with technologyÂ Â  feel a sense of presence like they're in a placeÂ \nwith the person and that's super powerful. IÂ Â  focused on designing social apps and experiencesÂ \nfor 20 years that's sort of like the Holy GrailÂ Â  of that is being able to build a technologyÂ \nplatform that delivers this like deep sense ofÂ Â  of social presence. The other big track is aroundÂ \npersonalized AI and for that and that's sort ofÂ Â  where Llama and Meta AI and all those things areÂ \ngoing. There's all this development that's goingÂ Â  into making the models smarter and smarter overÂ \ntime but I think where this is going to getÂ Â  really compelling is when it's personalized forÂ \nyou and in order for it to be personalized for youÂ Â  it has to have context and understand what's goingÂ \non in your life both kind of at a global level andÂ Â  like what's physically happening around you rightÂ \nnow and in order to do that I think that glassesÂ Â  are going to be the ideal form factor becauseÂ \nthey're positioned on your face in a way whereÂ Â  they can let them see what you see and hear whatÂ \nyou hear which are the two most important sensesÂ Â  that we use for for kind of taking informationÂ \nand context about the world. I think that this isÂ Â  all going to be kind of really deep and profoundÂ \nstuff but it's basically those two things: It'sÂ Â  this feeling of presence and this capabilityÂ \nof really personalized intelligence that canÂ Â  help you. I'd love to talk about each of thoseÂ \ntwo things. The first on presence, I owe a lotÂ Â  to being able to connect with people online. RightÂ \nthis job that I have is by definition that, also withÂ Â  my family. My parents don't live anywhere closeÂ \nto me. I video call them a lot and when I thinkÂ Â  about the progress of technology like this in aÂ \ntimeline from the telegram to the telephoneÂ Â  to video call to some feeling of presence withÂ \nanother person who's feels like they're rightÂ Â  there in front of me, that makes me feel incrediblyÂ \noptimistic. I would love a future where like I canÂ Â  lose in Scrabble to my mom and feel like she'sÂ \nreally there in front of me. Yeah and it feels likeÂ Â  we're not that far away from something - I agree!Â - that\npersuades my brain that that's happening. YeahÂ Â  totally. And also I miss hugging my mom right likeÂ \nthat never goes away. Yeah haptics is hard. Yeah andÂ Â  so my question is about thatÂ \nit's about this this feeling of like it's hardÂ Â  for me to imagine um a future where real physicalÂ \npresence is not different and special in some wayÂ Â  where I don't miss literally hugging myÂ \nmom and I'm curious how you think about theÂ Â  parts of human connection that are eye contact andÂ \nphysical touch and things that our ape brainsÂ Â  value for connection with other people. Yeah well eye\ncontact I think we're going to get to a lot beforeÂ Â  the the touch part. For haptics I do think we'llÂ \nmake progress on that but it's it's obviouslyÂ Â  there's a spectrum there too from kind of handsÂ \nwhich is where if you you draw out the kindÂ Â  of like homunculus version of a person in termsÂ \nof like what are what are our kind of sensory youÂ Â  know what what's like the majority of what we'reÂ \nsensing it's like yeah yeah so I think beingÂ Â  able to do that for your hands is probably theÂ \nmost important place to start and you have a roughÂ Â  version of that with controllers today. I thinkÂ \nthat that'll get even more over time. We have thisÂ Â  demo playing pingpong where you have a controllerÂ \nwhere as the digital ball hits the ping pongÂ Â  paddle you feel it hit the as if it's hitting theÂ \nping pong paddle wherever it is so you actuallyÂ Â  have a sense of like where it's it's hittingÂ \nthe the the paddle so I think that was thatÂ Â  was just a wild demo so I think we'll get some ofÂ \nthat the most extreme version of this is wantingÂ Â  force feedback right so I mean like for doing a lotÂ \nof sports right it's it's like okay we can kind ofÂ Â  do a good approximation of like boxing today orÂ \nyou get like good feedback on your hands but itÂ Â  would be hard to do a virtual reality version ofÂ \nJiu-Jitsu where you're like grappling with someone andÂ Â  you need like real kind of force feedback onÂ \nthat so that's probably like the hardest thingÂ Â  right to go do but I think we'll get there.Â \nYou know I think like most science fiction it'sÂ Â  not this binary thing that you just like wake upÂ \none day and we're like oh we've realized all theÂ Â  dreams but but I I do think that these platformsÂ \nare going to be the first time that I think thatÂ Â  there's a realistic sense of presence in allÂ \nthe ways that that's special to people forÂ Â  most things that people want to do which are notÂ \nthe most physical ones and even some of the basicÂ Â  physical ones I think we'll get. But then there'sÂ \na long tale of other stuff I mean smell is alsoÂ Â  really important for people yeah right it'sÂ \nI think it's disproportionately important forÂ Â  memories and that's not really a thing thatÂ \nI think in the next few years we're going toÂ Â  have in any of these devices I mean that's a veryÂ \ndifficult and challenging thing on its own. What isÂ Â  the piece of that that you feel most interested in,Â \nthat you keep coming back to in your mind? This hasÂ Â  the frustrating property to develop that theÂ \nsense of presence is almost like when you'reÂ Â  designing something that that's sort of tryingÂ \nto artificially deliver it you're deliveringÂ Â  an illusion to a person and more than any oneÂ \nthing that provides a sense of presence it'sÂ Â  actually more the case that any one thing doneÂ \nwrong breaks the sense of presence. You kindÂ Â  of know that you're interacting with technologyÂ \nbut it's so convincing that um that you just kindÂ Â  of go along with it. You're like okay yeah no thisÂ \nperson feels like it feel like they're there right.Â Â  When I did that pingpong demo I like at the endÂ \nof it I dropped the pingpong paddle on the virtualÂ Â  table and it shattered so that was not the bestÂ \nfor for our internal development butÂ Â  like that's winning in our in our developmentÂ \nright it's like when when you feel like somethingÂ Â  is is kind of so realistic that you you're justÂ \nconvinced that um that it's there now and thereÂ Â  are a lot of things that can break that right soÂ \nI think a a field of view that's too low right soÂ Â  something feels real but then you turn your headÂ \nand it's not there um latency read physics thatÂ Â  don't behave like realistic physics. It also isÂ \ninteresting in some ways what people can acceptÂ Â  as physically real even though it's not rightÂ \nso like we've done a ton of work on avatars weÂ Â  we have this whole work stream on Kodak avatarsÂ \nto do these photo avatars and it's I think it'sÂ Â  going to be incredbly compelling and people areÂ \ngoing to love it but one of the things I foundÂ Â  interesting is the ability to mix photorealisticÂ \nand expressive kind of the cartoony avatars withÂ Â  photorealistic worlds and kind of more cartoonyÂ \ncomputer game type worlds so you can have theÂ Â  a Kodak kind of photorealistic avatar of aÂ \nperson in what is clearly like a video gameÂ Â  or cartoon world and people are generallyÂ \npretty fine with that it's like okay thatÂ Â  that feels pretty good and similarly havingÂ \na photorealistic world but good increasinglyÂ Â  good kind of cartoon avatars as long as theÂ \navatars move in a way that feels authentic toÂ Â  the person you're interacting with it actuallyÂ \nfeels pretty good you know it's when you look atÂ Â  a 2d still frame of it some of the stuff canÂ \nlook a little bit silly and and we've certainlyÂ Â  you know had had a our share of memes aroundÂ \nthat but um but when you're in there you know andÂ Â  you you've played around with lot of the stuff itÂ \nfeels realistic because it's basically mimickingÂ Â  the kind of authentic mannerisms of of a personÂ \nthat you're interacting with and even if it's notÂ Â  a Kodak photo realistic avatar if it's kind ofÂ \na more cartoony expressive one so I I think thatÂ Â  that's it's very interesting to see kind ofÂ \nwhich pieces you need to unlock and what where youÂ Â  just need to be like very technically excellentÂ \nand consistent but it's um this isn't a spaceÂ Â  where it's like you deliver one thing and it'sÂ \ngood this is like there's a wide breth of thingsÂ Â  that you need to nail and then have it all comeÂ \ntogether and that's why these are you know 10 year projects. It seems like an interesting way to learnÂ \nabout the human brain and what we actually careÂ Â  about with respect to what feels real. I wasÂ \nwondering about, there was this moment in anÂ Â  interview that you did with Lex Friedman, you quotedÂ \nresearch that says that the average American hasÂ Â  fewer friends now than they did 15 years agoÂ  and I was so interested in that becauseÂ Â  it seems like if we want to get to a world whereÂ \nthere's more human connection this is the trendÂ Â  that we're going to have to grapple with and justÂ \nto give some data on this in the American Time UseÂ  Survey over the last 20 years the amount of timeÂ \nAmerican adults spend socializing in person hasÂ Â  dropped by nearly 30%. For ages 15 to 24 accordingÂ \nto the Surgeon General it's nearly 70%. and IÂ Â  look at that data and I think to myself well maybeÂ \nif we're all socializing digitally that doesn'tÂ Â  matter so much maybe there's a future where that'sÂ \nactually fine but there's also data that suggestÂ Â  that we're struggling somewhat. The number ofÂ \nAmericans who say that they don't have a singleÂ Â  close friend - yeah it's really sad - that share has\njumped from 3% to 12%Â in the last 30 years. It feels to me like with all the tools that we've built for human\nconnection, we're struggling to connect and I'm curiousÂ Â  why do you think that's happening? I mean there's a lotÂ \ngoing on to to unpack there. A lot has changedÂ Â  sort of economically and socially during thatÂ \nperiod and a lot of those trends go back beforeÂ Â  a lot of the modern technology. So I mean thisÂ \nis something that a lot of academics and folksÂ Â  have have studied but it is an interesting lensÂ \nto look at this though because I think wheneverÂ Â  you're talking about building digital typesÂ \nof connection one of the first questions thatÂ Â  you get is is that going to replace the physicalÂ \nconnection and my answer to that especially in theÂ Â  case of something like this is that no becauseÂ \npeople already don't have as much connectionÂ Â  as they would like to have. It's not like this isÂ \nreplacing some sort of better physical connectionÂ Â  that they would have otherwise had. It's that theÂ \naverage person would like to have 10 friends andÂ Â  they have two right or three and there's justÂ \nmore demand to socialize than what people areÂ Â  able to do given the current construct and givingÂ \npeople the ability to be present with people whoÂ Â  are in other places physically just seems likeÂ \nit will unlock more. It's not going to make itÂ Â  so, if I have glasses, it's not going to makeÂ \nit that I spend less time with my wife, it's goingÂ Â  to make it so that I spend more time with youÂ \nknow my sister who lives across the country. AndÂ Â  that's, I think that's good. IÂ \nthink people need that. As for the rest, IÂ Â  I think we could probably spend a multi-hourÂ \npodcast just going into all of the differentÂ Â  kind of socioeconomic political dynamics that areÂ \ngoing on but none of the trends that I've seenÂ Â  does it seem like the primary thing that's goingÂ \non is that because people are interacting onlineÂ Â  they're now not interacting with their with people\nphysically. Now certainly I think youÂ Â  you I do interact with people online who I alsoÂ \nlike to interact with physically but and I thinkÂ Â  that that's kind of like a combination um likeÂ \nmore combined richer relationship that you haveÂ Â  overall but I think that there's a lot goingÂ \non with the loss of of kind of social capital andÂ Â  connections that really predates a lot of theÂ \nmodern technology. The goal of what, I'm what I'mÂ Â  trying most to learn about is how we can structureÂ \nthe technologies that we use in the future to getÂ Â  toward this future I think you're imagining ofÂ \nmore human connection in more ways. I'm curious, youÂ Â  brought up the other big pillar of AI and in someÂ \nof your conversations, I'm thinking of a conversationÂ Â  with Tim Ferris in particular, you talked aboutÂ \na lot of different use cases of AI and they seemÂ Â  to me to fall on somewhat of a spectrum. LikeÂ \nfor example you mentioned automatic real-timeÂ Â  translation, like basically the Star TrekÂ \nUniversal translator. We're prettyÂ Â  much there! Yeah and that's one example on oneÂ \nend of the spectrum where some people might argueÂ Â  that there is a chance that someone is less likelyÂ \nfor example to learn a language because we can allÂ Â  speak to each other in real time in differentÂ \nlanguages. I think nobody would really argueÂ Â  that therefore we shouldn't have that kind ofÂ \nuniversal translator. People still learn Latin andÂ Â  Greek. Right exactly and so I think that endÂ \nof the spectrum is something like um technologiesÂ Â  that really measurably unlock our humanity becauseÂ \nthey remove a struggle between people and then onÂ Â  the other end of the spectrum there are a lot ofÂ \neducational things for example where the struggleÂ Â  is kind of the point right? Like it's like buildingÂ \na muscle. I can think of so many timesÂ Â  in my life where like the reason why I was doingÂ \nsomething was not the output it was the fact thatÂ Â  I was trying so hard to do it. There's one exampleÂ \nin the Tim Ferris interview where you talkedÂ Â  about your kids struggling to articulateÂ \nthemselves emotionally and adults very much hadÂ Â  the same problem and you talked about AI as a wayÂ \nto help them articulate those emotions. Yeah andÂ Â  I thought about all of the many times in my lifeÂ \nwhere I have struggled to articulate my emotionsÂ Â  and how I really could have used some help inÂ \nthose moments and I also found myself thinkingÂ Â  about the times when that was really buildingÂ \na muscle where like the act of struggling toÂ Â  communicate with someone and understand what theyÂ \nwanted from me was was important to my development.Â Â  And so my question is if you think about thatÂ \nas a spectrum between things that are reallyÂ Â  important to our humanity where and the struggleÂ \nbeing removed is helpful versus things where theÂ Â  struggle is the point and it unlocksÂ \nsomething about our humanity and is importantÂ Â  to preserve like building a muscle, how do youÂ \ndraw the line between those things and how doÂ Â  we ensure that the muscles that we're building forÂ \nthis future are stronger and not weaker? Yeah it'sÂ Â  interesting I mean I think we're always going toÂ \nfind new things to struggle with and I mean it'sÂ Â  you can always get better at communicating withÂ \nother people and kind of expressing yourself andÂ Â  understanding other people so having a tool thatÂ \ncan help you do that better isn't going to meanÂ Â  that like oh now we perfectly understand every youÂ \nknow it's I mean I think the maybe oneÂ Â  of the most functional aspects of this you'reÂ \nalready seeing a lot of these AI models reallyÂ Â  help people with coding right like a generationÂ \nago um before I was getting started a lot ofÂ Â  coding was like really low-level system softwareÂ \nand you know then by the time that I got intoÂ Â  it there was a little bit of that but um you youÂ \ncan make websites pretty easily make apps prettyÂ Â  easily and I think in 20 years or a lot soonerÂ \nthan that you're going to basically be in aÂ Â  world where kids will be able to just describe theÂ \nthings that they want and build incredibly complexÂ Â  pieces of software so it's um in that worldÂ \nare kids going to be not struggling I I don'tÂ Â  think so I think that they're going to be justÂ \nexpressing their creativity and and it'll it'llÂ Â  be this kind of constant iterative feedback loopÂ \naround like okay like yeah I you know took a fewÂ Â  minutes to describe this thing and like yeah thisÂ \nwhole like amazing virtual world was created thatÂ Â  I can have see on my glasses or whatever but likeÂ \nthese things are not exactly what I want them toÂ Â  be so now I need to like go back and edit them itÂ \njust I don't know I think that there's alwaysÂ Â  more. Another way to get this - it's one of the thingsÂ \nthat I think makes makes people so good. It justÂ Â  there's there's always more to do. We'll alwaysÂ \nfind the struggle? Yeah. Another way to get at thisÂ Â  is if you if you play this out to make theÂ \ntools even better in like 10 years let's sayÂ Â  your kids are in high school are there ways thatÂ \nyou would want them using AI because you think itÂ Â  would accelerate them intellectually and ways thatÂ \nyou would advocate for them not to use it orÂ Â  things that you would have concerns about? I meanÂ \nI think that there's some things that you needÂ Â  to be able to do yourself. I think that's a lot ofÂ \nthe basic fear that people have around this isÂ  that while we're building these amazing tools weÂ \nget away from this self-confidence and ability ofÂ Â  being able to do like this basic stuff yourself soÂ \nit's like all right you have a calculator but it'sÂ Â  still good to be able to do kind of basic math inÂ \nyour head because there are a lot of things thatÂ Â  come up throughout the day that you just want toÂ \nhave a general numeracy around right that oftenÂ Â  they're not expressed in numerical terms but justÂ \nin terms of understanding trends or understandingÂ Â  arguments that people are making, you you kind ofÂ \nneed to understand the shape of how numbers comeÂ Â  together and so I think one of the big debatesÂ \nis like should we still teach our kids to programÂ Â  computers even though you're going to have\nthese tools in the future that are just so muchÂ Â  more powerful than anything that we have now toÂ \nproduce incredibly complicated pieces of software.Â Â  I think the answer to that is probably yesÂ \nbecause I think teaching someone how to codeÂ Â  is teaching them a way to think rigorously andÂ \nthat even if they're not doing most of the codeÂ Â  production I think it's important that you kind ofÂ \nhave the ability to think in that way and I thinkÂ Â  it's going to just make you generally a betterÂ \nthinker and better person so yeah maybe that'sÂ Â  like this generation's version of calculatorsÂ \nit's like so you you want to you want to use theÂ Â  calculator but you'll also want to be able toÂ \ngenerally do without it. Other ones like languageÂ Â  I don't know I mean different people can comeÂ \nout I think this is one of the interestingÂ Â  questions about parenting these days is like isÂ \nis just kind of like what what's important toÂ Â  teach your your kids and in an era where so muchÂ \nis going to change over the the time that they'reÂ Â  even in school. Language I think you can makeÂ \nsimilar arguments. I think there's a lot of it'sÂ Â  like it's probably going to be less functionallyÂ \nrelevant in the future to learn multiple languagesÂ Â  but it sort of helps you think in different ways,\nyou know I found from the languages that I'veÂ Â  studied that a lot of it you learn aboutÂ \nthe structure of your own language, you canÂ Â  you know you also learn about the culture rightÂ \nbecause so much of how things are expressed inÂ Â  different places is tied to the nuance and theÂ \nhistory of kind of what how so I thinkÂ Â  like you that's all valuable and interestingÂ \nstuff to get into but then I don't know at theÂ Â  same time we only have so many hours in the dayÂ \nso people need to prioritize what they're goingÂ Â  to learn and it may be that okay in a world withÂ \nperfect translation which by the way we basicallyÂ Â  just announced on the Ray Ban Metas that nowÂ \nyou're going to be able to just like you go toÂ Â  countries yeah we're starting out with just a fewÂ \nlanguages but we'll roll it out to more and youÂ Â  know you'll be you could be traveling anywhere andÂ \nyou have your glasses and they just translate inÂ Â  real time in your ear. So it's wild, yeah soÂ \nI think people are going to need to choose whatÂ Â  what what they want to focus on going forward.Â \nHow do the developments that we've been talkingÂ Â  about in AI intersect with social media and theÂ \nplatforms that most people use today? There's aÂ  future where there's images and generated textÂ \nand maybe AI influencers. How does generativeÂ Â  AI change how social media feels in the future?Â \nYeah I mean I think that that's a reallyÂ Â  deep one. You know there's already been oneÂ \nbig shift which is that social media startedÂ Â  out as people primarily interacting with theirÂ \nfriends and now it is you know at least half ofÂ Â  the content is basically people interactingÂ \nwith creators or content that's not createdÂ Â  by people who they kind of personally know soÂ \nwe sort sort of already have that paradigm andÂ Â  I think AI is probably going to accelerate that. ItÂ \nwill give all these people additional tools rightÂ Â  so your friends will create kind of funnier memesÂ \nand more interesting content um that'll come fromÂ Â  a lot of different ways. I think some of it willÂ \nbe okay your friends have glasses and they captureÂ Â  a bunch of stuff and before they might have notÂ \nbeen able bble to edit it to make it interestingÂ Â  or maybe it was just too much work or they didn'tÂ \neven realize that they captured something amazingÂ Â  but now the AI is like hey I like made this thingÂ \nfor you out of your content um it's like okayÂ Â  that's awesome like people will enjoy that. CreatorsÂ \nobviously kind of much more specialized skillsÂ Â  are going to be able to use even more advanced AIÂ \ntools to make more compelling content but then IÂ Â  think that there will be a bunch of kind of greenÂ \nfield type stuff where maybe in the future thereÂ Â  will be content that is purely generated by AIÂ \nby the system personalized for you maybe it'sÂ Â  summarizing things that are out there that thatÂ \nare going to be interesting maybe it's um justÂ Â  producing something funny that makes you laughÂ \nthis is going to be like a very kind of deep zoneÂ Â  that there's a lot to to experiment with.Â \nI think there are going to be AI creators as well,Â  as creators building AI versions of themselves,Â \nI mean that's a thing that we just showed tooÂ Â  at Connect is basically I mean ifÂ you're\na Creator one of the big challenges isÂ Â  like all right there are only so many hoursÂ \nin the day and your community probably has aÂ Â  nearly unlimited demand to interact with you andÂ \nyou want to interact with them because you'reÂ Â  trying to grow your community. I mean that's bothÂ \nsocially and from a business perspective that'sÂ Â  sort of you know growing the community is anÂ \nimportant part of what every creator does soÂ Â  okay if we can make it so that each creatorÂ \ncan basically make an like an AI artifactÂ Â  that their community can interact with people beÂ \nclear it's not the actual creator themselves butÂ Â  it's almost like a piece of digital art thatÂ \nyou're producing like an interactive sculptureÂ Â  or something that it's like it's like you trainÂ \nit to here's the context that I wanted to haveÂ Â  here's the topics I wanted to communicateÂ \non here's stuff that I wanted to stay awayÂ Â  from you're giving your community something toÂ \ninteract with when you can't be there to to kindÂ Â  of answer all the questions and I think that'sÂ \ngoing to be super compelling so there's likeÂ Â  these interesting things but I think it's I AIÂ \nit's kind of like the internet in a way whereÂ Â  it's probably going to change almost every fieldÂ \nand almost every feature of every application thatÂ Â  we use um it seems sort of hyperbolic to say thatÂ \nbut I do think that's true and it's just hard toÂ Â  sort of enumerate all the different things upÂ \nfront but I think that over the next 5 to 10Â Â  years we're just going to explore the impactsÂ \nin each of these areas and it's going to beÂ Â  like an amazing amount of innovation and reallyÂ \nexciting. I feel two things simultaneously whenÂ Â  you say that. I feel both like I really wantÂ \nto be optimistic about the future of theseÂ Â  platforms and I obviously have gained so much fromÂ \nan enormous pace of change right like everythingÂ Â  that we're doing now and what I actually feel isÂ \nworried. I feel some specific concerns around theÂ Â  way that you know I might communicate with anÂ \naudience and the way that they might respond toÂ Â  that or the way that human communication mightÂ \nchange but also more generalized just sort ofÂ Â  fear of the pace of change and and worry and IÂ \ndon't think I'm alone in that feeling. Yeah andÂ Â  you're supposed to be the optimist! I know! And I'mÂ \ncurious like how you talk to people who feel thatÂ Â  way. What concerns do you feel are most legitimateÂ \nand what do you feel most misunderstood? I thinkÂ Â  the pace of change is always a concerningÂ \nthing right it's there is a lot of uncertaintyÂ Â  about how how things will go in the future andÂ \nwe're all going to get really amazing new toolsÂ Â  to do both our hobbies and our jobs and\nthey'll make it so we can do better work andÂ Â  have better lives but at least on the professionalÂ \nside it's going to be our responsibility to keepÂ Â  up with that or else it's going to be difficultÂ \nfor us to compete with other people who areÂ Â  doing a good job of kind of keeping up withÂ \nthe new trends. So I get it. I mean I thinkÂ Â  you know especially in the you know line of ofÂ \nwork of being a creator and it's a very sort ofÂ Â  competitive space, I don't think that like creatorsÂ \nnecessarily think about it as competitive but itÂ Â  is right it's like it's you know and um and so IÂ \nget it. I think that this is going to make it soÂ Â  that like the quality of work that people produceÂ \nand how interesting it is and how much they canÂ Â  communicate and like really efficiently is isÂ \njust going to kind of go through the roof butÂ Â  but when you're staring down a set of changes likeÂ \nyou know that there's some big change coming andÂ Â  you don't know what it is that's always a time ofÂ \nanxiety so I get it. If I take my creator hatÂ Â  off and I'm just a person who is youngish startingÂ \nout my career-ish, starting out building a family,Â Â  how would you advise someone like me to prepareÂ \nwell for the future that we're headed towardÂ Â  to be able to learn new skills now or just thinkÂ \nabout this future in an educated way? Yeah I meanÂ Â  I just think maintaining curiosity about things isÂ \nis important. I do think we can overstate to whatÂ Â  extent the next 10 years is going to be sort ofÂ \ndifferent from the last 10 or 15. I mean a ton ofÂ Â  stuff changed over the last 10 or 15 years too.Â \nIt's not like this is the only time in historyÂ Â  where there's some technology it's going to makeÂ \nit so there's new opportunities and things changeÂ Â  the internet coming into maturity and everyoneÂ \nhaving smartphones has already rewired thingsÂ Â  dramatically and I mean maybe the next period willÂ \nbe a somewhat bigger change or maybe it won't IÂ Â  think it'll feel different to different people but\n I don't think this is like going from zero toÂ Â  one it's not like okay everything's just kind ofÂ \nbeen normal and now like now it's about to changeÂ Â  it's like the technology of evolves over time andÂ \nand like the opportunities that we have evolve andÂ Â  improve and I think that's like the people whoÂ \ndo well I think are are people who are generallyÂ Â  curious about it and and dig in and and tryÂ \nto use it to live better lives rather than theÂ Â  people who who basically you know try to fight itÂ \nin in some way. One thing that I really want to askÂ Â  you about is open source. Yeah. I think imagine thatÂ \nwe're talking to an audience that has maybe heardÂ Â  that term but doesn't have any real idea of howÂ \nthat might impact them in the development of AI.Â  How would you explain the reasonable debateÂ \nthat people in your field are having about thisÂ Â  right now? Well I think there are two pieces. I meanÂ \nso what does open source mean? It means that peopleÂ Â  can build a lot of different things right so atÂ \na high level I look at the vision that a bunch ofÂ Â  companies have right so Open AI, Google, they'reÂ \nbuilding an AI right like one AI that I thinkÂ Â  in general they're like okay this is going to beÂ \nit's like you're going to use they think you'reÂ Â  going to use Gemini or ChatGPT for like all theÂ \ndifferent things that you want to interact withÂ Â  and at a high level that's just not how I thinkÂ \nthe world is going to go. I think we're going toÂ Â  have a lot of different AI systems just like we'reÂ \ngoing to have we have a lot of different apps.Â Â  I think in the future every business just likeÂ \nthey have a website and a phone number and anÂ Â  email address and a social media account is alsoÂ \ngoing to have an AI that can interact with withÂ Â  their customers to help them sell things to helpÂ \nthem do support. I think a lot of creators willÂ Â  have their own AIs right I think like a lotÂ \nof people will interact with with a bunch ofÂ Â  different things. There's a question of okay do youÂ \nwant a future that's fundamentally kind of veryÂ Â  concentrated and where you're interacting withÂ \nkind of one system for everything or do you wantÂ Â  one where a lot of different people are building\na lot of different AIs and systems just kindÂ Â  of like you probably didn't want there to be youÂ \nknow just one app or just one website. It's like aÂ Â  richer world when there's a diversity of differentÂ \nthings so that's one piece is is just givingÂ Â  people the ability to build it themselves andÂ \nwhat open source does it makes it that everyoneÂ Â  can take and modify the model and build stuff onÂ \ntop of it which is different from the kindÂ Â  of closed and centralized approach. The safetyÂ \ndebate is a specific part of this which is in aÂ Â  world where AI gets smarter and smarter, what's theÂ \nway that we have the highest chance of of having aÂ Â  a a kind of positive future and and not havingÂ \na lot of the safety concerns? And I think someÂ Â  people think that if we keep the model closedÂ \nand don't give it to a lot of developers thatÂ Â  should make it safer because then you don't getÂ \nbad developers doing bad things with the model. Historically I think what we've seen with openÂ \nsource is actually the opposite which is thatÂ Â  this is not the first open source project rightÂ \nI mean this is obviously this has been a thing inÂ Â  the industry for decades and I think what we'veÂ \ntraditionally seen is that open source softwareÂ Â  is safer and more secure largely because you putÂ \nit out there more people can scrutinize it becauseÂ Â  they can see all parts of the system and thenÂ \nthere are inevitably issues with any softwareÂ Â  there are bugs there are security issues andÂ \ninitially with open source people thought hey ifÂ Â  you're putting the software out there and thereÂ \nare holes in it isn't everyone just going to goÂ Â  exploit those holes and especially the badÂ \nguys but it turned out that it sort of in thisÂ Â  counterintuitive way that by making by adding moreÂ \nscrutiny to the systems the holes became apparentÂ Â  quicker and then were fixed and then peopleÂ \nroll out a new version just like we roll outÂ Â  a new version of our models right Llama 3, LlamaÂ \n3.1, Llama 3.2 everyone upgrades, so I think theÂ Â  same thing is going to happen here I think it'sÂ \nsort of this counterintuitive thing where evenÂ Â  though I I think there's some concern around allÂ \nright are bad guys going to do bad things withÂ Â  these models. I actually think you just get a kindÂ \nof smarter and safer model for everyone the moreÂ Â  it's rolled out and the more kind of scrutinyÂ \nis on it and then part of that is we getÂ Â  feedback and we make the model safer so that isÂ \nwe roll it out to to more people it's saferÂ Â  for more people to use. So I think that the historyÂ \nof open source in the software industry generallyÂ Â  would suggest that open source is going to leadÂ \nto a more prosperous and safer future. Our showÂ Â  is called Huge If True and what I mean by that isÂ \nkind of testing the most optimistic non-obviousÂ Â  thing and so my question to you is what is theÂ \nbiggest open genuine question on your mind right now? In which field? You're in so many! I amÂ \nparticularly curious about the combination ofÂ Â  AI and hardware but I realize that we've coveredÂ \na lot so I'm curious the direction you'd take thisÂ Â  on a question that occupies you right now. GoshÂ \nI mean I think maybe one that's a little moreÂ Â  AI specific is there a current set of methodsÂ \nthat seem to be scaling very well right so withÂ Â  past AI architecture you could kind of feed anÂ \nAI system a certain amount of data and and useÂ Â  a certain amount of compute but eventually itÂ \nhit a plateau and one of the interesting thingsÂ Â  about these new transformer based architecturesÂ \nover the last you know 5 to 10 years is that weÂ Â  haven't found the end yet. So that leads to thisÂ \ndynamic where Llama 3 you know we could train onÂ Â  you know 10 to 20,000 gpus, Llama 4 we could trainÂ \non you know more more than 100,000 gpus, Llama 5Â Â  we can plan to scale even further and there's justÂ \nan interesting question of how far that goes. It'sÂ Â  totally possible that at some point we just likeÂ \nhit a limit and just like previous systems there'sÂ Â  an asymptote and it doesn't keep on growing butÂ \nit's also possible that that limit is not goingÂ Â  to happen anytime soon and that we're going to beÂ \nable to keep on just building more clusters andÂ Â  generating more you know synthetic data train theÂ \nsystems and that they're just going to keep onÂ Â  getting more and more useful for people for quiteÂ \na while to come and it's a really big and highÂ Â  stakes question I think for for the company isÂ \nbecause we're basically making these bets on howÂ Â  much infrastructure to build out for the futureÂ \nand this is like hundreds of billions of dollarsÂ Â  of infrastructure so like I'm clearly bettingÂ \nthat this is going to keep scaling for a whileÂ Â  but it's one of the big questions I think in theÂ \nfield because it is possible that it doesn't. YouÂ Â  know that obviously would lead to a very differentÂ \nworld where it's I mean I'm sure people stillÂ Â  figure it out eventually just need to make someÂ \nnew fundamental improvements to the architectureÂ Â  in some way but that might be a somewhat longerÂ \ntrajectory for okay maybe you know the the kindÂ Â  of fundamental AI advances slow down for a bitÂ \nand we just take some time to build new productsÂ Â  around this or it could be the case and that'sÂ \nwhat I'm betting on that the fundamental AI willÂ Â  just continue advancing for quite a while and thatÂ \nwe're going to get both a new set of products thatÂ Â  are just really compelling in all these waysÂ \nand that the technology landscape and what'sÂ Â  possible will just continue being dynamic overÂ \nlike a 20-year period and that's probably whatÂ Â  I'd guess is going to happen but it I think it'sÂ \none of the bigger questions in the industry andÂ Â  kind of for technology across the world today.Â \nIs there anything else that you want to say? IÂ Â  don't know! Awesome. We're good. Amazing yeah thankÂ \nyou so much for doing this. Yeah no thank you...",
