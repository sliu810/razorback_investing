    "[Music] welcome back to the Bitcoin layer today it's a special episode because not only am I joined by Nick but I'm also joined by a very good friend of the show Michael Howell he's a CEO of crossb capital of course the global liquidity Savant it's quarterly at this point but we're very happy to have him on the show Once Again Michael how are you I'm pretty good thanks Joe very good to be here again and good to meet Nick absolutely it's always a good conversation with you so let's get the ball rolling straight away here uh when we talked last and this was early February um the bull market was raging on it still is Raging on we went through a bit of a correction but you advised that while the party continues it might make sense to dance near the door per se there were some conditions happening in the background that were were a little bit disconcerting I suppose now three months later just about uh give us your updated overview uh on global liquidity and where we're headed okay well I mean as as you know our view is the Global liquidity is pretty much all that matters you've got to understand uh effectively where where money is flowing in the in the Global Financial system and that's what we track um we think that the trend is basically uh uh upwards over the medium term the uh the doubt we had or the concern we had maybe over the course of uh the last one or two quarters is that basically what you've got is a situation where there was likely to be an air pocket and that air pocket was being driven by uh the Federal reserve and it was largely because of the of the tax filing date uh April 15th I believe which was likely to take a lot of money out of us money markets so if you add that factor or let's say accurately subtract that factor it's a dipping liquidity the other thing that was going on in the background were was China and if there were two really important central banks in the system it's basically the Federal Reserve uh and it's the People's Bank of China and what you had was not just the Federal Reserve maybe touching the the brake pedal ATT Tad uh you also had the People's Bank of China withdrawing liquidity from the system now that was important in the context that uh really for most of the second half of last year China was actually pushing huge amounts of liquidity into their financial markets and they basically stopped after the Luna New Year Peri period largely because the uan the Chinese currency was coming under a lot of pressure and they need to tighten money markets so what you had is the two big play in the system basically withdrawing liquidity and that air pocket is something that we were concerned about and I think it's really behind some of the corrections we're getting in Risk asset markets right now but the trend let me say behind that is still likely upwards and we still believe that our framework is uh telling us that you know the low in the cycle was let's say October around October of 2022 just after the British guilt debacle and the peak is likely to be in late 2025 now Michael we understand that there are so many components to your liquidity index coming from central banks all over the world as well as commercial Banks to tell us what you believe will be the main contributors toward a boost in the global liquidity index going forward for the rest of the year okay the for the rest of the year I think it's likely to be Central Bank easing and I think you can see around the world may be stepping outside of the US for a moment but a lot of central banks are very keen to ease policy uh you've seen that actually even today in the case of uh Britain where where the British Chancellor the Finance Minister has actually cautioned the bank of England on making two rapid interest rate cuts which is an astonishing statement in itself to say that actually a finance minister is saying Don't Cut Rate so aggressively so you've got that backdrop you've got Japan where you know there is a seeming reluctance to actually rein in the weakening Yen by an aggressive tightening of monetary policy and we know that from in Europe uh Mainland Europe the ECB is basically talking pretty openly about cutting interest rates in the next maybe four weeks or so so what you have is a backdrop where uh many other central banks are actually very interested in easing policy and I think given the backdrop of sluggish economies um there is really a willingness or an openness to actually 's policy I think the the slower party out there is the Federal Reserve I suspect that is likely to speed up I think that what you will see uh in the period in the run up to the election is probably a lot more stimulus coming out of the FED uh through the balance sheet we already have one hint of that with the tapering of the QT program uh we always thought that was likely uh you know around q1 Q2 of this year and you know it's happened uh it's been a little bit more maybe aggressive in the tapering than we uh envisioned first off but clearly that's happening and I think you've got the other Dynamic which is likely to come through which is that the uh the the treasury is likely to run down its balance at the FED a lot more aggressively maybe than people are thinking and that is you know I think the Janet in her Q uh or the Q announcement from the um from the treasury was very very conservative about um the size of the treasury general account this is getting a bit in the weeds here but it they were very conservative about the level of the treasury general account but I think that was really to make a statement that they didn't want to uh uh you know give a a sense that they were goosing the markets ahead of the election so uh that may be dis playing politics but I I figure they will do I mean I think it's not likely that it's going to step up at these elevated levels so more liquidity is coming basically the Bitcoin layer is very proud to be sponsored by river a

concurrent because I know that you're focusing on the Bitcoin price as a tell and you are joining podcasts like ours because you know that from the Bitcoin side we're focused on global liquidity because we see it as a driver so I'm wondering what you feel about the Bitcoin price does it lead or is it concurrent or does it slightly lag how do you view it well the the answer is let let's look at the data um the uh I think it's very difficult to argue why the Bitcoin price should lead and I think there's a compelling uh theoretical argument as to why it should lag and if you look at the evidence from the data it's pretty clear that it does lag now having said that the lag is relatively short uh from our experience in uh looking at other assets so what you would normally say uh for example I mean this is a very broad uh broad summary but Equity markets tend to get a kicker from liquidity traditionally after about six to nine months that's normally the lead time the real economies are more stretched out that's more about 15 months or so before you get a you get any traction from the real economy the fixed income markets and the Forex markets are a lot more sensitive and they tend to get their kicker about 3 months to six months after turning liquidity you know for example exle this a lot of our analysis goes back to the time that I was in Salomon brothers and as you will know many people will know Salomon Brothers was the biggest fixed income player worldwide and we used to look very very closely at these monetary flows and what you found was that as liquidity came into the system whether it was from the federal or other other players uh it tended to shift the term structure about 8 to9 months uh you know after an initial shot so that's the sort of lead times you kind of expect in financial asset for Bitcoin it seems to be much much shorter it's in a period of about sort of six to 8 weeks from what our analysis shows and we've done very thorough anal analysis looking at weekly data and we've actually Incorporated that using Granger causality tests uh looking at a structural VAR that's a vector Auto regression model try and understand how some of these shocks pan out and it comes out statistically significant with that kind of lead time now now interestingly if you also Factor gold bullion into that equation gold tends to be uh again uh responsive to liquidity you've got to say that it has a lower sensitivity than Bitcoin or ethereum but it tends also to respond rather later so that's more in the normal Forex Camp of being about three to six months afterwards excellent and I have the uh I have the chart here that is in your uh chart deck that kind of illustrates you see here uh gold and crypto obviously bundled together following Global liquidity and then following uh us CPI clearly here us CPI is not a very uh not a very good basket if you're trying to track liquidity and it seems like the these assets have done a pretty bang-up job with it yeah and I think it's I think Joe it's very it's worthwhile making this distinction or drawing this distinction because the word inflation is used very widely but let's kind of drill down and really examine what we mean here what we're talking about when we talk about monetary inflation is this expansion in global liquidity that we're seeing in other words on on the chart it's the black line that you see published there and the orange line is the market capitalization the size of the gold bullion Market plus the crypto market so those two factors together are really matching over the long term the movement in global liquidity now that is a monetary inflation in other words it's a devaluation in the value of paper money what you've got alongside on that chart is a broken line at the bottom which is actually us CPI that is High Street inflation High Street inflation and monetary inflation are not the same thing uh monetary inflation is an ingredient into High Street inflation but it's not the whole story what you've also got to take into account what's happening to costs and costs can be factors like o prices it can be factors like technology gains in other words the Big Boost of productivity that's coming through it or ultim AI it could equally be uh you know as well uh the impact of China and the fact that China is dumping very cheap Goods into uh the American High Street and therefore prices are coming down so that gap between the black line and the broken line is basically telling you that over time there has been cost deflation in other words costs have come down so if you look at what is the future for inflation uh in the American High Street it's basically a monetary inflation by Federal Reserve or the fiscal authorities uh plus what cost gains you can get or what cost productivity gains you can get uh from industry now it may well be that we're underestimating the AI gains or the technology gains but we may equally be overestimating the impact of China uh in the future because China is unlikely to be such a major supplier uh you know as one is led to understand uh into the Western economies in the future uh given tariffs and whatever else so it's kind of swings and roundabouts but you kind of get the idea there are two moving Parts uh in terms of High Street prices now when you talk about the monetary inflation you have in the past referenced the monetization of t- bills at the Commercial Banking level that commercial banks are absorbing a massive influx of supply of treasury bills and that in that as the central as the commercial Banks sorry the commercial Banks expand their balance sheet to absorb these T bills that this is a monetization of bills through the banking sector not through the Federal Reserve so correct I'd like to understand the mechanics a little bit more of this does this happen because commercial banks are funding their T Bill purchases through the repo market and what I'm also curious about is that the the TGA side of it the TGA gets funded only when reserves are debited at the Federal Reserve account so reserves do flood into the TGA when T bills are issued but it's my understanding that the commercial bank system is expanding to absorb this and that they are able to expand the system via repo so can I was hoping that you can explain this concept to us and get as deep into the mechanics as you'd like yeah I think it's uh yeah I mean it it's pretty straightforward I mean uh if you've got uh whatever the debt is whether it's coupon debt or whether it's bills uh if those uh instruments those Securities are bought by a credit provider that is monetization in other words they're using their balance sheet to fund the federal government so in other words what you've got to think about is a situation where the government writes a check to URI uh we put it in our bank account uh that increases the size of the liabilities of the banks but the banks have got a match that with assets so if they basically uh buy government paper that is Direct monetization on the other hand if the government sells to the private sector the non-bank private sector then all you're doing is you're swapping a bank deposit for a longer dated coupon Bond so that's not a monetization if the banks are either credit providers by uh by the debt then that's a direct monetization and the point being and the point that I'm trying to make in in those comments is that Banks don't tend to buy long-dated coupons they tend to buy very short-dated coupons and bills they have a tremendous appetite for bills so you know they are the big buyers when you get treasury bill issuance so if that if Janet is leaning more towards Bill financing then you're going to see the banks Hoover up more of this and that is a direct monetization uh and what I've argued recently is if you look at the statement that came out both of the Federal Reserve uh and of the end of the treasury with the quarterly refunding announcement uh in the last few weeks what you've actually seen now I would argue is a direct is an accord a so-called Accord between these two bodies maybe that's no great surprise but what they're working towards is duration management so they're trying to limit the supply of coupon in the system and whether that's the Federal Reserve saying well look hey we're not going to roll off so many from our balance sheet or whether it's Janet saying we're not going to issue so many uh we're going to keep we're we you we're keeping the calendar pretty much level here in terms of coupons and any swing payments in the fiscal deficit is is is basically covered by bills um now what that will mean is presumably the bill issuance will go up over time and that will break the longer term assumption that we've always held that uh treasury funding is about one bills four fths coupon uh and I would imagine that's going to drift higher over time it it has to and and for our understanding that does two things number one when commercial Banks monetize the debt by being credit providers expanding their balance sheet it boosts Global liquidity because you have the asset side of commercial Banks growing and that boosts Global liquidity on the other side you don't have the duration hit to the market when you're issuing bills so duration won't sell off as much as it would that boosts the prices of the collateral within the system and that also boosts Michael's Global liquidity index and so from both of these sides what you're getting is a boost in global liquidity and so then a boost of risk assets and then uh hopefully for the administration you know a favorable look from the electorate is is that accurate that is 100% correct and that is the that is the way to look at it looking at te accounts as people do misses the point here okay because you know clearly every asset has a liability and every liability has an asset so by definition they they're going to balance but what you need to take into account is duration and you know I I occasionally give talks at uh at Business Schools about liquidity and what's going on and I always start those Talks by saying look in finance the most important concept to understand is duration okay uh in other words mcau duration it's a wonkish finance concept but you will understand it but it's something that you really need to understand because what shows is it's a measure of the average timing of cash payments uh you know over time and a duration of five years tells you that you you're going to get your payment your cash payment uh on average after five years so duration is a really really important point in financial markets because financial markets wouldn't exist if there was no duration uh by definition so you've got to take uh duration into account effectively what we're really saying is liquidity is kind of the ratio between assets or liabilities and their duration and that is really what matters so you can get a change in liquidity if the if the pool of assets changes or if the duration mix of those asset changes Michael one day one day I dream that you will visit Los Angeles and guest lecture with me on campus and uh explain this concept to the students to layer on because duration is basically the first concept I teach each after I introduce fixed income we go into duration then we go into portfolio management uh I want to ask you before I hand it back to Joe you mentioned in a recent interview the Shanghai Accord a a half decade ago or actually almost a decade ago now and what's going on in Japan with the Deval devaluation of their currency and you also mentioned Here China facing pressure on its currency and therefore having to uh go go backwards on providing liquidity to the market so I was hoping that you could uh go to Asia for a second give us your whole overview and help us understand the currency War over there what is happening okay well this this this goes back to actually the book I wrote called Capital Wars a few years ago and what capital Wars is already about is saying that there is a tussle going on uh between if you like the great powers uh but it's being fought out in financial markets and currency markets uh rather Less on on the battlefield if you like traditional Battlefield and what you've got is uh uh a tussle between the dollar uh as the preeminent currency worldwide and Rivals that are coming through of which the Chinese are kind of posting the Yuan as their rival vehicle now as it happens China uh is a de facto a dollarized economy effectively and what China needs to do is to get off the dollar Hood and basically try and Export Yuan uh to the rest of the world in the same way that America exports dollars one of the things that that book says uh maybe controversially maybe not is that the whole idea that Bretton Woods ended in 1971 is a complete fiction okay maybe it's a convenient fiction but it's it's a fiction Breton Woods still exists the Breton Woods deal was all about putting the US dollar at the center of the Global Financial System since 1971 that has got even stronger not weaker okay the the Breton Woods up to 1971 was basically trade dominated since 1971 it's been Capital flow dominated but the dollar is the preeminent currency worldwide and there are absolutely no challenges to that as far as one can see it would be really really difficult uh for China to even you know scratch the surface here but clearly they're trying and one of the things that uh occurred in 2016 uh was that China was facing the prospect of a weakening Yuan when the dollar generally was strong and at a G20 meeting in Shanghai in early 2016 there was a secretive uh deal to basically stabilize Asian currencies now as I say it was secret it wasn't publicized but there's a lot of stuff on the internet about that Shanghai cord and if you look at the period from early 2016 to early 2022 the degree of volatility uh or the degree of stability if you like in Asian currencies is unprecedented you've never seen anything like the stability effectively a basket of Asian currencies flatlines through that whole period okay very very unusual even in the uh official Breton Woods period Asian currencies were not as stable as they were in the last as in that five year sixy year period now what then happened let me just say why is that important because if China is the Lynch pin uh around that Shanghai cor the Chinese Yuan and China was through that period operating monetary policy to stabilize the uan if you look at their monetary operations it was it was definitively doing that it gives China an ability to then promote the Yuan as a rival to the dollar because you've got a stable store of value in the system and other people can hold the uan okay uh as a uh as a either a vehicle currency or as a a store of value what you saw in March of 2022 interestingly but we can leave that for another debate it coincided with Russia's invasion of Ukraine but that may be another story who knows that may be linked it may not be what you saw was the CH the Japanese Yen starting to weaken furiously now a lot of people have been arguing for a long time that the yen is structurally undervalued uh because they look at trade surpluses is and they ignore the fact that actually we're not in a world of trade now in a world of capital the Yen started to weaken furiously in all my years of working financial markets which is now totting up to be quite quite a large number uh I have never seen a major currency weaken with the speed that the Yen weakened through that two or three month period from early 2022 markets are not as ruthless for major currencies as that uh governments are so this seemed to me to be a government-led move in other words there was something going on if governments wanted to manipulate one particular cross among the major crosses the Yen dollar is the easiest one to manipulate and I suspect there was something going on now if you now come up to date what you find is that coming into early 2024 uh the consensus view out there was that the Japanese Yen was the best best trade of the Year almost everyone was saying look the Yen's going to Rocket here it's going to move up it's going to go back from whatever it was 140 or thereabouts uh back to uh 110 you know you've got a structural rise in the Yen coming wrong because the yen is inst instrumental here in weakening the Chinese Yuan and destroying the Shanghai cord the Shanghai CT is in tattas it doesn't exist anymore Asian currencies are volatile there's been a huge step down and nobody in their right mind would want to hold the Yuan because it looks as if it's got to devalue more and the trigger for that which put all the pressure on the Chinese was the weakening Japanese Yen because this is a competitor currency in the region so to my mind and I could of course be completely wrong here but my mind my instinct tells me the Yen was a stalking horse uh a trojan horse if you like to weaken the Chinese Financial system and basically underscore do dollar preeminence now now in all that period and let me just finish with this comment in all that period did the US Treasury put its hand up and say hey look this is unfair competition why is the Yen devaluing so much this is a major trade partner of America surely this is unfair competition uh the Japanese are sort of you know potentially dumping Goods on America at cheap prices unfair because they said that about Vietnam when the Vietnamese devalued the dong by a much smaller amount and Vietnam hey is not anything like as important in Japan uh as Japan to American trade but the treasury were completely silent about Japan but they kicked up a fuss about Vietnam so what's going on I think it's a stalking course and I think what you've got is a deliberate weakening in the Yen and what you're looking at or what we're facing here is a Chinese Yuan that is going to devalue to about eight against the US dollar and that's what I think he's going on very well said I want to shift gears here briefly to the fed and then I do want to ask about um uh China and demographics uh you you had a chart in here and one of the bullet points that you talked about was that the FED liquidity could surge over the coming months as the US Treasury forces the end of QT we just saw um that uh the FED did announc the taper that everybody was expecting uh and you have this chart right here walk us through how the tapering of the fed's balance sheet impacts fed liquidity and then how you define fed liquidity and then the impact that that's going to have on risk markets okay the the point about the chart is that what you've got there is principally two lines the red line uh that you can see the the higher line is looking at the size the reported size of the FED balance sheet and that is what the FED has got all of us to focus on or the markets to focus on as a measure of their QT process so in other words that you know go back three years uh an increasing fed balance sheet was good uh now a falling f balance sheet is good I didn't quite work out the difference but anyway that's the that's the rhetoric that comes out of policy makers um but the issue is that the balance sheet per se is not entirely liquidity creating some elements on the balance sheet actually withdraw liquidity from the system uh some have no effect and what you've got to do is single out those elements that are liquidity creating and that's what we do in the orange line and that's what I wrote about about five or six years ago in the book Capital Wars we went through the FED balance sheet and tried to understand some of these ingredients and why it's important to actually analyze these various components now there are basically three major items on the FED balance sheet to think about you've got the bulk of the asset side which is you can think of as Fed Credit and if anyone wants to follow this uh this narrative with numbers uh look at the H 4.1 release that comes out 4:30 uh every Thursday uh in the US so that's published by the Federal Reserve that's their press release and all these numbers are are crystal clear so Fed Credit is the bulk of the asset side of the balance sheet now that per se would create liquidity in the system it would load up US money markets with cash apart from the fact there are two drains coming up one of those drains is What's called the treasury general account which is basically money that the federal government holds in a bank account uh is not circulating in the system and it holds on the FED balance sheet so you got to remove that the other element is basically a relatively newfangled uh uh element which is called the reverse repo program or facility which is basically money which is again out of circulation it's held on the FED balance sheet and it was really a replacement for the excessive Bill issuance that occurred during the covid crisis when uh essentially those treasury bills absorbed uh all the transfer payments that were pushed through into bank deposit accounts so as the bill issuance dried up so the Federal Reserve to preserve uh the Integrity of its interest rate policy issued the reverse repo accounts now what you've got going on uh in in the system is that the red line is still going down although it's going down at a slower pace and you can see the step up when uh Silicon Valley Bank uh blew up uh on the chart and what you've also got uh as you can see is an inflection around that time it was actually coincident with the British guilt crisis uh and the svb crisis uh in the orange line and that inflection is basically causing liquidity to rise and that's largely because the reverse repo account has been run down aggressively releasing liquidity back into the system and the treasury general account has sort of swung around a bit and the latest step down in that orange line is because the treasury general account jumped uh with tax filing in the US a after April 15 and what you've had is a lot of money entering the treasury and therefore coming out of bank deposit accounts uh coming out of the money markets now of circulation and the dotted lines there represent our projections and so what we're Envision what we envision here is there'll be a slow climb back now the problem with that particular statement is that what does it mean for Bank Reserves and the way that we think about this is that this is the input at if you like which is pouring money into the money markets what comes out the other end uh feeds into Bank Reserves so Bank Reserves pretty much move par pursue with that orange line and so what you'd expect is a dip in Bank Reserves that you're getting now and a slow recovery up our concern is that that pushes some of the regional Banks below their so-called adequate res Reserve threshold and it may create some problems and I don't think that Janet wants to face problems ahead of the election so I would fully expect uh the Federal Reserve to focus more and more on trying to get liquidity levels up again and speaking very briefly of the adequate Reserve level I actually have a chart that showcases the adequate Reserve level for both small and large Banks and I'd like to get your thoughts on it very briefly before I pass it back to Nick because it does touch on exactly what you were talking about there in that Bank Reserves are kind of at a a bit of a scary level right now where they're bumping up against what would be considered their Reserve constraint so here just to explain this chart for you because it is new and we didn't talk about it beforehand um this right here is the reserve constraint level historically the reason I marked it there was because um Bank Reserves have never been able to dip below this level they tried to in 2018 they failed and it's also the level that they bounced off of um when uh Silicon Valley Bank cratered and with be with the bank term funding program um Bank Reserves it's and this is small Bank cash reserves as a percentage of their total assets and uh thanks to btfp um this is where they were but now without btfp we're kind of right below that level once again in this red dashed Line This was with btfp the facility is no more loans are being paid back so we're right under this Reserve constraint level um so I guess I'm curious in your thoughts on this um how close are we with Bank Reserves to what would be considered this Reserve constraint level and what should policy makers have in mind uh when they're thinking about these things well I think the the the answer is that nobody really knows okay and that may be uh an astonishing uh admission uh but really nobody knows and if you look and there's a chart in one of our presentations or one of our our reports that uh that I put together which basically shows over time the Federal Reserves own estimates of adequate reserves in the system okay and you plot that and it draws out an exponential curve so in other words over time they've upped this minimum Reserve level many many many times so they've got no idea what it is um and so how should we now my view is I draw up a similar chart to the one that you show there Joe but actually my dotted line for the reserve constraint has a slight upward Trend in it over time as the system expands and I think we're pretty close to that threshold right now which is why I would Envision that policy makers have got to start acting and it may be that Janet decides that she's going to run down the TTA rather faster uh it may be that uh there are other means of actually getting liquidity into the system uh or it may be they go through the back door as I've suggested and start to issue a lot more bills and those bills are effectively a way of Rel liquifying the system but ultimately you're going to get you need the system needs more more monetary liquidity and the point that you know all our research and why this is an important factor on why I keep hammering on about this is that we're in a world now that is very different from the textbook world the texbook world tells us that interest rates are all that matter um you know I put for example a piece out on our substack Capital Wars today which was saying does do Federal Reserve interest rates Drive Bitcoin prices uh spoiler alert no that don't have any effect um what really matters is ultimately the fiscal arithmetic now why is that so important let's put this in context the textbook model says that interest rates Drive the system because what they're saying is we're in a world where Capital spending is really driving the business cycle so you know if we're in that world I'll come quietly and say well I agree that a higher cost of capital will freeze out Capital spending and what you'll see is a slower economy as a result hey we're not in that world anymore nobody's really doing massive amounts of capital spending nobody's building you know Capital intensive plant like Chemical Works or steel works or whatever in the west leave that to China and that's not interest rate constraint that's decided by The poit Bureau or whatever or Z jingping or whoever of his acolytes decide those things it's not about interest rates it's not Market driven we're in a world now in the west where it's not about Capital spending but financial markets are refinancing mechanisms not new financing mechanisms and a world of refinancing it's not the interest rate that matters it's the capacity to roll the debt and what I mean by refinancing is think of an example uh a sort of Homespun example of uh of a home mortgage right if you got a home mortgage which is a 25e mortgage and it comes up to Renewal after 25 years you're not that interested necessarily or at least step one on what the interest rate you pay is what you're really desperate about is whether you can find a credit provider or a bank who's going to lent to you can you roll the debt over because if you can't roll the debt over you're going to default and you're homeless okay so it focuses the mind in a world of massive debts and we've got $350 trillion of debt worldwide with an average maturity of five years which tells me there's $70 trillion of debt on average that you've got to refinance every year which is about what uh a short three quarters of world GDP but that's got to be refinanced every year by financial markets on top of what else they do so financial markets are absolutely now refinancing mechanisms and they basically overshadow new financing for Capital spending about four or five to one so this is the world we're in in other words balance sheet capacity is absolutely critical and balance sheet capacity is all about liquidity and what drives that liquidity the ability of the system to create liquidity are the central banks and the availability of collateral and that really is all it's all it's about so that's what we try and understand and as that liquidity is increased then you get a spill over into asset markets you get asset price inflation and ultimately you may even get high Street inflation but that's you know another story so that's the liquidity generation mechanism Michael I want to ask you about the refinancing that you mentioned a lot of it takes place at the overnight treasury repo level so we monitor Sofer volumes which are basically yesterday's repo volume primarily these are dealers that have treasury positions that are financing their inventory we also know that in September 2019 we had a repo crisis because some of that collateral couldn't find repo funding and it ended up with the FED instituting a standing repo facility my question to you is that in an ample reserves framework in which reserves are declining and the FED has to then expand reserves again there will be a signal from the market or from from Banks themselves that hey we're up against the restraint here in September 2019 it was a repo crisis but we have the standing repo facility today so what is the market signal to tell us we are up against Reserve constraint how will we see it is it in the repo Market or somewhere else I think I think the repo markets are a pretty good bellweather of this um I'm not um I mean you you know a lot more about the repo markets uh than I do but uh I would say that maybe it's not uh it's not a fail safe signal uh because maybe you can get problems outside of this in other in other corners of the market and I think one of the difficulties uh with you know the financial system of the moment is or currently is that it's complex and there are areas that we're not really too sure about for example the you know the shadow banking industry is one very clear example of that now I'll give you you know a couple of examples about this process number one is to say that every financial crisis you can think of in the last two or three decades has fundamentally been a refinancing crisis whether it's 2008 uh with the European Banks needing to be ba ultimately bailed out by the FED uh whether it's the repo crisis in 2019 whether it's the Asian financial crisis uh all the Financial crises are basically about refinancing problems okay so this is why it's so important if liquidity is not forthcoming you get a problem and what that tells you is that the relationship or the ratio between liquidity in the system and debt uh has got to be stable uh and that's really the necessity so if you see a rising debt GDP ratio for economies and that's what most economists are predicting you absolutely must have the stability a rising liquidity to GDP ratio but we know that as the liquidity to GDP ratio Rises asset markets inflate uh that's you know that's a fact so you are going to get over the longer term monetary inflation and Rising asset markets that clearly has political implications in terms of wealth divides but hey that's a different area to to think about the other thing to to say is that let's think about historical examples and one of the things that I've often said is that the Shadow banking industry today uh is an echo from what happened in the British Financial system in the 19th century now that seems a long step but there's a direct parallel there was a um a bank uh if you call it a bank but a financial institution called overend gurnie which basically went bust and the bank of England refused to bail it out and that created a financial crisis in 1866 now the overend gurny uh Institution was effectively what we'd call a shadow bank today it was huge in the equivalent of the repo markets it was a bill broker and they basically ran into liquidity problems and there was a shadow banking crisis then uh but the bank of England deliberately turned its back on over and gurny and ultimately what came out of that was the writings of uh of Walter badget Lombard Street and the bank of England acting as lender of The Last Resort which everyone now pretty much follows now the the point about that story is that one of the ways in the subsequent period that the governor of the bank of England trying to detect whether there were problems in the money markets is that traditionally every Thursday he would da his top hat which is what they wore in those days and physically go out and walk the streets of the city of London around the money market to see if he could detect whether there are any problems in terms of liquidity and I'm not suggesting that uh that Jal does that today but you get my point that you've really got to you've got to have a lot of feelers it's not really a question of just looking at interest rates and saying well hey interest rates are going to look after themselves and that's all we need to do there's got to be an active understanding of the liquidity needs in the system when you've got so much refinancing to go on now ultimately the solution of this is to say we'll get rid of debt but that's impossible debt is the bogey that's sitting on top yes I'm sure that the New York fed's open market operations desk is talking to dealers about their repo activity on a daily basis and communicating that back to the fomc so that they understand where that Reserve constraint is um and and people should should definitely go check out Walter badget and the history of the bank of England becoming the lender of Last Resort because that does pin the model for where we are today I want to ask you one question about crossborder Capital uh before I hand it back to Joe your firm is crossborder capital it's also the component of your framework that I'm struggling the most with because as a fixed income guy I understand collateral values driving uh liquidity I and I also understand balance sheet expansion driving liquidity but try try to uh break down why you named your firm crossborder Capital why that's such an important component to understanding liquidity uh very good point it's because we're in a world where Capital flows are important and those Capital flow shocks are often the factors that actually destabilize domestic Financial systems so if you see liquidity coming into a uh Financial system it tends to be uh if you like multiplied um number of times and you get these liquidity shocks now I I'll give you some examples of that but broadly speaking uh that's why crossb capital is important and perhaps think about these examples and this is going to get maybe I I I'm going to try not to get stuck in the weeds here because it's kind of a complicated area but basically Capital flow shocks should influence what economists call the real exchange rate okay so if you get a big Capital shift from from the rest of the world into America the US real exchange rate should go up now what is the real exchange rate it's the nominal dollar times some price index of us prices now the reality is in the modern world is that High Street prices and service prices are generally quite sticky they don't move very much and what takes all the impact is financial asset prices so effectively if you get that shock of liquidity coming in uh a global Capital flow it's the nominal dollar which goes up and asset prices go up now just think about what's happened in the last uh 15 years right what you've had since the global financial crisis largely because of I would argue because of instability in the rest of the world and because of the Basel Accords a lot of money is coming to us safe assets so money is coming to the US system what if you seen you've seen the dollar rise and you've seen asset markets rise okay and that's a normal feature what did you see in Japan in the 1980s you saw a very similar feature you saw Capital coming into Japan you basically saw the Yen going up and you saw asset markets going up now what happened uh in the middle 1980s was the US was very concerned about the strength of the dollar uh at that time for different reasons and they basically said to the Japanese what you've got to do is to try and loosen monetary policy so in other words don't let the Yen appreciate so much and try and get the y or try try not to yeah try not to get the Yen appreciating pump liquidity into the system and what they did is they took they kept the Yen stable effectively and they inflated their domestic asset markets causing a bubble now that bubble ultimately burst and we've had you know a legacy of three decades of problems in Japan ever since what happened in the Emerging Markets uh the Asian emerging markets in the mid90s exactly the same phenomena big Capital inflows pressure on real exchange rates to rise governments said we don't want to decouple from the US dollar so let's actually keep our currencies flat we'll pump in domestic liquidity which is what they did and over inflate a domestic asset bubble which again Burst when the capital flow retreated what happened in China in the wake of 2010 you saw a similar Factor Capital coming in the Chinese wanting to fix their currency against the dollar so what they did is they eased monetary policy and you saw this huge bubble in Chinese asset prices exactly the same phenomena I can give you more examples Scandinavia in the early 90s all these examples are very rude examples and what we've got to watch for is this movement of capital flow when am when am I going to get worried about the US system is when you start to see a significant Capital outflow leaving us assets and I think there's a chart I probably sent over in the pack which actually looks at the difference between what's happening in terms of us Capital flow and what's happening in terms of Chinese Capital flow and basically what you see is huge outflows from China in the last 15 years and huge inflows into the US dollar in the last 15 years consequently us real exchange rate goes up yeah so nominal dollar Rises Wall Street Rises strongly China real exchange rate goes down dramatically here's the chart for China big Capital outflows real exchange rate goes down in China result Yuan Under Pressure but they tighten to try and stop the Yuan falling and Chinese asset markets are destroyed exactly this it's the classic unwind that we've seen time and time again so this is why Capital flows are important because they ultimately are a cause of destabilization in the Global Financial system now I'm curious about the position of China and Japan are they are they selling treasuries as well at the same time as capitals actually flowing out of China and going into the dollar I'm trying to understand how these large countries are managing their US Treasury position yeah I think that's uh that's uh part of that puzzle but it's a it's a separate question and the I mean the fact is that China is reducing its treasur Holdings I think one could debate how fast I think the unequivocal point is they're not expanding their treasury Holdings as rapidly as they would have done in the past given their swelling Trade Surplus and traditionally they've basically at the margin put a lot of that extra uh you know Trade Surplus into US Securities and they're clearly not doing that anymore they're finding other vents for that they're buying gold uh they're going through what may be a a reformed belt and Road initiative uh with physical investment they're buying Commodities so they're trying to find other vents for that that money but I think that you know ultimately um that's what's going on the the problem is that China is the real exchange rate is under pressure in China uh and that's really what we've got to face now in my view what you see in this if you like Capital flow unwind is that the real exchange rate of China goes down what would you expect to see in that environment you expect to see price or asset deflation or let's say price and asset deflation and downward pressure on the nominal uan and I'd say tick all those boxes because you've got deflation in the High Street in China you've got asset huge asset deflation and you've got downward pressure on the Yuan it's telling you absolutely that the real exchange rate is under downward pressure and that's the normal adjustment mechanism that we see time and time and time again in the world economy wonderfully said we covered a lot Michael Nick do you have anything else uh I want to ask one last question about term premium because this is a concept that it goes back to your duration uh point from earlier that if we have increased duration that hits the market that this is going to affect liquidity term premium right now is the topic dour so explain to us how we should be looking at term premium is it a function of the qra announcements is it a function of something else yeah I think it's look the the what is term Premier term Premier is not something that anyone can calculate easily it's a sort of wonkish concept you've got to do a lot of math to actually extract it from the ter from the term structure but it's a very important implicit component because basically what the what a bond yield decomposes into is into two moving Parts one is interest rate expectations and the other is if you like a risk premium called a term premum for actually holding the bond over the investment Horizon and actually facing potential interest rate risk so it's a compensation what you're looking at the moment is a very anomalous situation because the term Premier rather than being positive being a compensation is it's negative an investor ultimately has to pay to the market to actually hold a bond now that's really a head scratching event and it shouldn't happen and the reason it's happening is there's basically been an artificial scarcity of Treasury coupon um by the federal res by by the US Treasury why has that happened it's largely because there's big demand for safe Assets in the system from Banks and insurance funds to a very large extent because of the barel Accords and because they keep saying that banks have got to hold more safe assets and you know us treasuries are the pristine safe asset in the system so everybody wants to hold those they're the most liquid uh instruments in the in the system and you know I keep coming back to the point that if you look at the history of Finance the most important price in every Financial system through time is the price of the dominant economy's debt that is US Treasury bonds that is absolutely key the issue is that um if you over Supply those treasuries the price of those treasuries is not going to go up anymore you're going to go down it's just supply and demand and that's basically what's happening despite the good efforts of the Federal Reserve despite the good efforts and the subtleties of Janet at the treasury what you're facing in the US is a massive increase potentially in coupon debt issuance in the medium term and as I keep saying the US is the cleanest shirt in the global laundry here okay I'm not hearing on the US it just so happens it's easier to analyze because America is very trans transparent in its data and the Congressional budget office gives us predictions out to 2050 of what basically debt the debt burden could be uh in terms of spending and uh and um and Taxation so it's transparent which makes it easier but I assure you every other country is in a far far worse situation now that debt issuance is clearly going to weigh on the treasury market and the problem we've got into which is why monetization is the is the important word to think about while fiscal dominance is a concept to understand and why Bitcoin and gold bullion and other crypto may be the way out of this for investors to try negotiate these risks and the problem is that if you start to think about what's Happening Here the contrast with today or contrast today with 1980 in 1980 when vula was at the fed us interest rates were were 15% right so we're now at a third of those levels but the debt burden is getting even bigger the interest payments we've got to pay on the debt now exceed a trillion dollars more than the US defense budget that focuses the mind right it is going to get worse why is it going to get worse because in 1980 the debt GDP ratio the public debt GDP ratio was 25% now it's 125% it's five times bigger and it's getting more and by the magic of compound interest which after all Einstein said is the eighth wonder of the world and he you know he should know um by the by the dent of compound interest what you've got is that these interest payments are escalating over time and they're compounding and the issue that what this really means is that the standby that the monetary authorities always had in the past is to say well look hey we don't care about this because we can always discipline the markets because what we'll do next year is we'll hike interest rates we'll push people out of risk assets like equities and we'll force them into government bonds and then we can start the whole process again because we can fund ourselves at lower interest rates and everyone is cramming into the bond market because of the threat of recession trouble is they can't do that in the future because the interest bill is so high now that if they start pushing up interest rates and bond yields start to rise even more the interest bill is going to going to you know Shoot To The Moon uh it's you know it's going to be out of control so their ability to to move interest rates is very very limited so my view is that what you've got is a situation out there where interest rates don't move very much at the policy level it's very difficult for japal to do very much in in all honesty um you've probably got an upward sloping curve because of the pressures of of term Premier Janet would try and offset that by basically saying look what's got to happen here is we're going to go through more Bill issuance we're going to try and restrict the amount of coupon that's coming on the market uh the Federal Reserve May Hoover up more of that coupon so they go back to what is called QE or although they may rename it quantitative support depending what the acronym Department of the Federal Reserve thinks are but um they're going to go down that route but ultimately what you're talking about here is fiscal dominance and monetary inflation and in a world of fiscal dominance and monetary inflation a 6040 asset mix Equity bonds is exactly the wrong mix it won't work what you need is radically lower bonds and more direct re monetary inflation Hedges like gold and cryptocurrencies and that's why we're bullish on Bitcoin in the in the in the medium to long term because whatever you might say about the cycle uh whether liquidity es and flows in the next 12 months is not necessarily the point the trend has got to be upwards for the simple reason that the fiscal regimes in every Western Country are out of control because of mandatory spending because of polarized politics in the domestic level which means that you can't really effectively raise taxes without alienating your critical marginal voter uh and at the global level there's a polarization between us and China which means that defense outlays have got to be much much higher so the fiscal arithmetic just doesn't work unless you've got monetization and monetization means uh asset markets go up so you know there's an old saying in Ireland which is if you want to get to Dublin don't start from here but that's where we are it sounds like a de facto yield curve control policy from the treasury Department as they try to manage the shape of the yield curve and how much long-term debt is going to be issued Michael Howell crossb capital thank you so much for joining us once again at the Bitcoin layer and for your tremendous insights and for teaching us so many things
