"Risk of US Re Inflation, China Disinflation",2024-09-25 12:15:04+00:00,4,WFjPwzgcUAE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFjPwzgcUAE,are you saying that right now the risk of a reinflation kind of moment is greater or less priced into a market and more real than say a downdraft in growth well certainly it's less priced into markets when you look at long-term inflation expectations the expectation is for you know for inflation to be at 2% or below 2% essentially forever uh and given the geopolitical dynamics given the fed's easing into a relatively strong economy given the fact that you start you still see a lot of sticky dynamics in inflation particularly related to wages which are showing some signs of reaccelerating that whole picture doesn't really align with the probabilities of you know a certainty around 2% inflation and much more likely that we have higher inflation head rather than lower inflation normally somebody with that kind of view would be bullish because if you believe in this sort of strong economy that could foster some reignition of inflation that would be probably positive for equity valuations but you wrote the stock market is priced to perfection and so far this is providing plenty of data points that the perfection is unlikely to be achieved in reality why well i think when you're tr trading markets you got to trade against what the price and expectations are and we're at pees that are you know almost as high as they were during the tech boom um we have forward earnings growth expectations in the mid teens that's a pretty strong scenario uh already priced into the markets now the fed is helping that along uh and that's probably a positive but i think the story is much more around u being long stocks relative to bonds because that's the scenario you know of the growth re acceleration that probably isn't fully priced into the market let's introduce china into the conversation they're now exporting disinflation perhaps even deflation how do they factor into your world view right now well china is experiencing uh uh debt deleveraging um you know akin to what happened in japan and akin to a classic balance sheet recession classic balance sheet recession and the policy makers there are um maybe uh driven by motivations are not related to macroeconomic policy more like political motivations and so for whatever reason they're choosing not to respond to the situation uh and so china's probably in this malaise for the foreseeable future um i think the effects on the west are are actually relatively limited and the reason why that is is you know china's deflationary impulse has been basically the same for the last couple of years probably china is not going to accelerate in terms of getting a a deeper and deeper um or a wor rate of deflation going on in the economy and if anything we've seen it tick up and so the big picture is it's not it's probably not the main story that's going on when you're looking at us inflation western inflation in general what really matters it's the labor markets it's all about the labor markets it's all about that wage data uh if you look at the atlanta fed wage tracker data we're one to two points above where we were preo uh and unless you believe productivity has matched that increase uh that's an underlying inflationary pressure that remains in the economy but bob isn't the deflation ar pressure coming from china has everything to do with the commodities market isn't that helping western economies yeah it certainly is an effect on the commodities markets and if you're trading you know copper or uh or other direct commodities that china has a meaningful share of that's going to be an influence a meaningful influence on that supply demand but the flow through of that to to the um to the us inflation picture it's pretty tiny compared to rents labor um the other sort of imported you know the other sort of imported goods costs that um you know cars new cars used cars all of those things represent a much bigger impact on us inflation and us policy
"Equity markets, Fed Cuts and Inflation",2024-09-24 12:15:05+00:00,4,y36GJaSo9WM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y36GJaSo9WM,hey bob great to chat with you i want to talk about what we are seeing across the board in terms of sector action with the s&p uh closing at a fresh record today but that wasn't the case across the board we saw a little bit of pressure in tech we saw utilities performing well do you think that there are certain sectors of the market that are kind of coming out of recessionary territory and others that are preparing for it what do you make of the bifurcation well i think a lot of this comes down to the pricing and when you look at what's priced into the tech side side uh of the equity market uh you have not only perfection but uh you know some of the most uh incredible uh earnings outcomes that you could uh that you could achieve and so i think part of the story here on a forward-looking basis is that easing is going to help create a bit more breath uh in the overall stock market so those areas of the market uh that have been uh underperformers relative to med cap uh growth companies are likely to see some benefit from an easing of financial conditions and at the same time those lofty expectations in uh the mega cap tech stocks you know are continually very challenging to uh to meet on an ongoing basis and so i think some cooling there relative to the rest of the market uh makes a lot of sense ahead let me ask you bob you know the fed did deliver that super siiz cut and i think investors are trying to figure out what comes next year what's the path of and trajectory of cuts look like from here what are you telling clients bob well i think the most important thing about that meeting was that uh chairman powell uh outlined the need to cut monetary policy ahead and at the same time talked about those cuts in the context of a strong economy and that combination of dynamics plus the speakers that we saw come out uh through the course of today suggests that the fed uh is happy to cut interest rates even if the economy is strong so it's not necessarily clear that you need a meaningful weakening of employment conditions over the course of the next 15 months to get the kind of cuts that the fed uh has talked about and the reason why that is is they you know the fed believes that inflation is beat uh it's no longer a concern and so if it's no longer a concern why maintain interest rates at this level when you can you know cut interest rates and avoid even the smallest risk of an economic downturn are you buying that call on inflation from the fed bob well i think the way that measured inflation is reported we're unlikely to see a meaningful shift in measured inflation over the course of the next year plus and i think that's a very interesting dynamic which is that to the extent that uh the fed delivers uh accommodative policy into a reasonably healthy economy that's likely to create inflationary pressures ahead we're already seeing it to some extent uh in seeing wages start to pop up a little bit uh by very timely measures but the problem is that will not flow through to measured inflation rates until you know 12 15 24 months from now and so the fed is going to juice the economy here and probably juice asset prices but won't suffer the consequences in the reported data uh until you know considerably uh ahead and so that creates this period of time where there's the risk at the fed is too easy relative to underlying conditions
The Constraint on AI Growth Expectations,2024-09-23 12:15:04+00:00,5,rRfBhNsPwpY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRfBhNsPwpY,turning turning to the ai story um you know the the the the greatest techno optimists will talk about how ai is going to deliver um double digit earnings growth over the course of the next 10 years as a function of incremental investment increased productivity and margin expansion by companies um and the reality is that just the investment and just the increased productivity even if you pencil in incredibly good productivity like a 2% support to productivity has a very modest impact on earnings because you know a lot of that you know margins are only 14% or 133% so you know if you get increased productivity and it goes to equally to labor and capital it's not that big a deal it helps your top line but that's about it the real thing that the techno optimists in the ai world are talking about is massive margin expansion and for instance to get to mid double digigit earnings growth over the next 10 years you would have to have margins expand by 1% every year for the next 10 years and why would they right yeah and the challenge with that the challenge with that that the techno optimist can't answer is if you get more productivity if you sorry if you get better margins what that means is you're firing people relative to your top line and who if you fire the people who is spending the money the only way that margins expand is if you have someone else some other sector to savings and so in order to get anything close to what uh those folks are expecting you'd have to have a different sector of the economy started to save by at a rate that's something like six or seven per of gdp every single year forever to support those margins you know are we gonna have government budget deficits that are 7% of gdp bigger forever in order to support those margins are household is going to just save 7% of gp a year like it the math doesn't work and this is this is the exactly the same problem that happened in the tech bubble back in 2000 is people were penciling out the same sort of outcomes and didn't recognize that it the implausibility of having you know that productivity boom that isn't met with rising incomes and that's basically you know set expectations that were implausible that then collapsed so is that what people are missing in this is that even though we have companies that are profitable and that's one difference between today and the 200 bubble uh the growth just isn't where the market has priced them in yeah i i i think i think the big the biggest challenge the biggest challenge is whether or not i mean the i think tak a step back technological innovation is very very hard to fully understand the magnitude of technological innovation and the idea um you know essentially what people are saying is that this is uh that this is going to have an effect that's equivalent to the personal computer you know i'd say uh you know my base case would be that that's probably not true um uh but you know it could possibly happen but i think the the thing that people really miss is the cash flows because it uh like the laws of physics cash flows uh are the are the constraint to uh corporate uh you know corporate income right it corporate income is not a uh it's not a theoretical thing it has it's built of cash flows both in terms of revenue and spending and if you can't connect you have to connect that optimism to cash flows to get the outcomes that are being described and that's the thing that doesn't fully that doesn't connect well and i and i have talked to plenty of techno optimist and i've gotten none of them none of them have given me an answer to the question of if you fire all the people to get those margins who is going to pay for the topline growth
The U.S. Dollar As Reserve Currency,2024-09-20 12:15:05+00:00,3,gD93Xi0nWp0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD93Xi0nWp0,if you look at the history of what has brought down um core reserve currencies it typically takes losing a war um as a primary reason why you why there would be a transition you just blew my mind but honestly away from that currency and so um you know could i what are the probabilities could i see uh a situation where there's a meaningful global conflict and the us is a loses that global conflict and as a function of that um you know the us monetary system becomes less important uh certainly i think to suggest otherwise would be uh foolish um absent that at least you know i'd say in the next 10 20 years there's not a lot of clear alternatives that exist and that's really when it comes to a reserve currency it's not the perfect currency uh it's it's the one that has the deepest most liquid capital markets with the best sort of legal infrastructure and that's really that that's the us like like i always thought you know and i was um very familiar with some uh very aggressive ceno files uh that the idea that china was going to take over uh the chinese yuan was going to be a meaningful reserve currency to challenge the dollar like that always sounded like garbage to me given you know the infrastructure i always like whenever i think about the chinese yuan and the reserve currency i think about um uh the the comments from the head of the russian central bank which who who's actually like quite a sophisticated thinker in in markets and she's basically like why the heck would i ever hold you know chinese yuan in the case of an emergency they'll just take it away from me with capital controls no point like man if the russians won't hold your currency as a reserve currency like you know good luck yeah i agree do you want them to be the arbit arbiter of global trade and the answer there is no but is kind of ironic that that came out of russia considering we did freeze up a lot of their dollars absolutely right but even with that even with that they won't hold the chinese one still trust okay so yeah that is that is an excellent point
The Value of Gold,2024-09-19 12:15:00+00:00,4,EnQcD1aRSxE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnQcD1aRSxE,"well i think gold from uh from a more secular perspective i i find very compelling for two reasons one from a fundamentals perspective if you just you know what what problem do we have globally not not not just us go gold is a global asset very important to recognize so like what happens in china and you know other developed economies and in the emerging world they all matter to gold supply and demand the big picture story globally is we have too much debt and particularly too much government debt relative to our ability to earn income in the future uh to pay off those debts and the basically the way that that works and you know that that's that's a story that has existed many times in the past through many different cycles and has basically only resulted in one very simple solution which is the devaluation of money relative to stuff uh and incom producing assets and that's that's how it works out and so that sort of fundamental you know who knows you know today tomorrow 3 months who knows but what what matters is sort of strategically we're in that circumstance that should be beneficial uh you know should be really beneficial to to gold uh over time and then i think um you know more structurally i think gold has benefited from uh being totally vastly under owned particularly in the west like the you know if you look at financial advisers 90% of them don't have literally zero zero gold in their clients portfolios and those that do have gold you know the average is like 1% of your portfolio and you just compare that to stocks or frankly bonds and you look at it's like the whole world is overweight stocks and bonds and nobody holds any gold and so it just doesn't take that much shift in allocations a one percent shift in allocations would be a huge influence on the gold market that's amazing quick can i throw two quick followups so number one you said gold is a global asset we're not really like a bitcoin show but we have had crypto people on like nat let natalie brunell most notably and uh we're always i'm always trying to distinguish between the two i think you said something that's important gold is a global asset um bitcoin is not right not yet i mean even ch like china banned it at least for a period of time could you say that bitcoin currently is not a global asset well i i think i think bitcoin is um there're certainly a there are certain certain areas of the world that are excluded from it and excluding china uh through bands is a is a pretty big component uh of it and you certainly contrast that with gold like part of the reason why there's so much domestic chinese gold demand from the private sector is because they can't invest in other assets uh including bitcoin right so gold you know real estate sucks stocks suck you know wealth management products suck uh they can't get their money out of the country into dollars like the only thing that's left is to you know p gold that's it's it's you know the the the longtime asset i think when it comes to to bitcoin you know the corrar there's certainly some corrar between bitcoin and gold i just think when you think about which uh people are going to move to in this sort of environment like gold has three a 3,000-year track record in a certain you know uh demonstrating these return properties bitcoin has meaningfully less track record and if you just empirically look at the return pattern you know gold is doing what you'd expect it to do given that fundamental dynamic and the drivers of bitcoin been much more idiosyncratic uh over time and so you know just less confident that bitcoin is going to be a good uh alternative currency uh or or a reliable alternative currency"
Will The Consumer Be Driving Demand in Q4?,2024-09-18 12:15:04+00:00,2,ZiarhIbXPXk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiarhIbXPXk,to a little bit more micro bob lost potentially in all of this is the fact that after september we've got q4 and the consumer is very important during q4 and not just the high-end consumer we've seen some credit stress uh inflation stress on the middle class workingclass consumer what kind of signal do you think the market which is still expensive is going to need to see during the fourth quarter to feel like everything's okay well i think the the key challenge on the equity side of things is uh just strong the expectations are for earnings growth over the course of the next you know 15 to 18 months they're really expecting something like you know low to mid double digit earnings growth uh and the only way you're going to get there is either through pretty good top line or you know pretty significant margin expansion up back to highs and so the question for i think a lot of folks that are looking at the stock market is how do we get those sorts of relatively elevated expectations to get realized you're going have to see a lot of strong demand in the economy and so far when we look at what's going on you know demand is okay it's not meaningfully slowing or creating anything that's close to a recession but we're a long way away from the type of boom that's being priced into stocks right now i can't help but wonder if we end up seeing a lot of buying this holiday season without a lot of discounting and then you you don't end up with uh with those things that you talked about
How Do Elections Factor into Asset Markets?,2024-09-17 12:15:02+00:00,3,DvkK9ogcDtw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvkK9ogcDtw,so obviously we have a us election coming up you know we've had this big turn of events with kamal harris replacing joe biden um you know i mean how how how do you look at like an election as a factor when it comes to investing in markets i think most elections uh are uh are more riskmanagement uh type uh periods rather than uh rather than uh times to generate alpha i i think anytime your your uh your macro uh your macro manager is out there saying that they have an edge in trying to predict you know us elections or uk elections or any of these elections like they're getting over their skis the ability to predict the macroeconomy is totally unrelated to the ability to predict elections uh frankly uh elections seem you know much more uh in the area of astrology to me that they are of concrete uh concrete fact and so when you're trading through these sorts of periods you you want to understand what's priced in but probably the biggest thing you want to understand is uh making sure that you're not overly exposed to one particular outcome or another um in this circumstance you know i think they're it's any reasonable person say basically it's a it's a coin flip it's about a 5050 um you know anything other than that is kind of marginal um there are relatively big differences between the parties there's some similarities in terms of likely continuing uh an expansive fiscal policy but there are pretty big differences whether it's about tariff policy uh immigration or uh or about um let's say uh corporate friendly positioning uh whether it's on taxes or regulation and so you know an election uh of either party could could either could create meaningful divergences in asset markets and so you just don't want to be overweight one particular view or another and i think if you went through the 2016 election or you went through brexit which are both i think good pes where you had bodal outcomes that were very um very close uh and you had large market moves in either direction as a function of those of those outcomes uh and some of which were unexpected um you know i think it's very important just to not not get to overweight one of one particular outcome or another
Considerations for Proactive Rate Cuts,2024-09-16 12:15:00+00:00,4,0sjnzy5x-OE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sjnzy5x-OE,you should the fed proactively cut like the relationship between um things like uh openings and wages and the unemployment rate are not known i think it's just really important to recognize that we do not know how those things are going to play out through time uh and as a function of that i think it's very important to recognize that um because of that uh making policy decisions based upon speculation about how relationships might play out job openings as a simple example relative to the unemployment rate or wages um is foolish uh and therefore i think um you know could shouldn't the fed preemptively cut uh in order to avert recession dynamics um i think is it's it's always a question there's always the um the desire or always the lever um where recession dynamics always seem scary ahead and it always can feel better to cut interest rates now on the possibility that um that recession could possibly come and you want to get ahead of it but what we've seen you know but but there's a risk and i think the risk is not talked about in it which is that if we reinl this economy after a period of years of above target inflation um a reinflation of this economy could easily create a scenario where inflation expectations become stuck uh at at a level that is elevated um compared to you know a desirable level at 2% and without a meaningful deterioration of growth it's not clear that uh it's not clear that we're getting a meaning ful deterioration and growth and without that it's not clear that the balance the challenges of higher embedded inflation are worth the risks of you know are worth proactively cutting and that's the tradeoff and i think in general we say proactively cutting that doesn't mean maybe the fed cuts 25 basis points or whatever maybe the fed cuts a little bit what i'm talking about is aggressive cutting and so uh the argument that there is no cost of aggressive cutting you know from aggressive cutting is is um people aren't considering the the possible consequences of it and uh embedded inflation from a structural perspective go back to the 70s talk to people who lived through the 70s and the pain that occurred there that was 15 years of terrible economic pain and so avoiding years and years of terrible economic pain in order to you know avert a possible circumstance that labor markets might possibly be deteriorating that's not a good trade-off and i think that's the that's the thing that the fed and and to be clear other central banks are wrestling with and they're increasingly recognizing that um you know there's no reason to be proactive in particular from the fed's perspective because if things start to be meaningfully weak they can always cut interest rates given the fact that they have a meaningful range at their disposal
Unlimited Macroeconomic Webinar September 2024,2024-09-12 12:15:07+00:00,23,Wpl8ppZObxw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpl8ppZObxw,[music] september 2024 macro webinar asking the main question how many cuts so this month i wanted to do something a little different than what i've done in past months um instead of uh looking at sort of a bespoke set of information across the various uh economies uh and talking through and and giving that synthesis based upon all those sort of individ visualized or tailored perspectives i wanted to scan across the major developed economies using largely similar charts across each to really help uh give perspective on the biggest them that i think is going on in the markets right now which is the expectations of an aggressive easing cycle by developed world central banks despite the fact that inflation remains elevated and economic conditions remain pretty good uh across most of the developed world and so let's get into it uh i'll start with this chart in the us which i think is probably the most important chart uh in terms of what's going on today and here the green line is uh the target rate and the blue line is the two-year interest rate and so what you can see here is that the two-year interest rate is trading way below about 175 basis points below the current fed funds target rate and what this effectively means is that market participants expect that interest rates on average over the course of the next two years will be 175 basis points lower than they are currently today and essentially what that means is that there's going to be an aggressive rate cutting cycle uh as much as 225 basis points over the course of the next 12 months and continuing uh thereafter that's the path of monetary policy that's necessary in order to get the type of two-year interest rate pricing that we're seeing and so what that means is that at its core what we're seeing across the economy or across markets is this expectation of a very very aggressive uh fed cutting cycle ahead now i think it's important to connect that to what's actually going on in the real economy if you look at what's happening with growth conditions they're on the leftand side a couple of different measures real gdp we also have you know final sales of to domestic purchasers and final sales of domestic producers all just different lenses to understand what's going on comprehensively with the economy and what you see when you look at this is that despite the fact that interest rates have been elevated for an extended period of time what we see here is that real gdp in the united states real gp growth has remained you know depending on exactly how you measure it between two and 3% that's pretty good for an economy that has uh a prime age workforce growth rate of you know below 1% um and productivity on a longer term trend basis that is you know a percent or so um maybe a percent and a half you put that together and you get an outcome where um this level of growth is creating a level of prime age labor force participation that is at multi-decade highs um while there's a lot of focus on the unemployment rate that unemployment rate of course is uh at the economy wide level it's still pretty low all things considered at 4.2% um having ticked up somewhat from last year uh but when you look at essentially the core workers the folks who can who are you know their prime ag working days what you see is that basically um you know it's been a long time since we've had this level of employment and that hasn't really changed much over the course of of the last year um despite the sort of unemployment despite the unemployment rate rising most of the unemployment rate rise has actually been amongst younger cohorts below uh 25 um so reflecting the fact uh and has also been a function of the fact that we've gotten a big rise uh an increase in new supply people coming into the labor market so that can overstate the weakness on the economy-wide level whereas when we look at the core of what's going on with the labor market it still looks pretty strong not much deterioration here so reasonably strong economic conditions you know fine economic conditions labor force uh participation or labor force or employment amongst the core of the economy you know at alltime highs and still dealing with the persistence of uh elevated inflation relative to the fed's target now here on the left hand side i show both cpi um which is you know currently running in the low threes and expected to basically stay at the same level about 3.2% based upon what's expected uh in tomorrow's uh report core cpi year-over-year and then of course we have core pce which is a little bit lower for a variety of technical reasons you can see it's generally lower than cpi um which is still running in the mid tws you know both of which are clearly above what the fed's target is and um with with relatively challenging comps through the back half of the year it's um you know unless there is a uh surprise uh deceleration and inflation and measured inflation odds are that these numbers will remain elevated compared to the fed's target and probably even more important than the nuances of exactly the timing of year-over-year inflation and the and the and the comparables ahead is the composition of inflation still reflects the fact that there is a fair amount of in embedded inflation pressure in the economy on the right hand side i've broken down inflation to two different pieces which is the services side as well as the good side and i think it's important to recognize if you look at that blue line what you see is that a big you know a big driver a big driver of what we've seen in terms of the disinflationary environment has been a function of poor goods prices falling rapidly in fact the pace at which they're falling today is the lowest pace that they've been you know essentially the most negative that they've been uh for pretty much the last uh three or four decades except for a a short period um in just after the 2000 uh bubble crash and so what we're expecting to to believe that uh that the current level of inflation will persist for an extended period of time is really quite a bet on uh the fact that these core goods prices will continue to fall at the pace that they've been falling uh in the recent period and so you know that certainly is uh you a big part of what's happened uh in terms of price growth is that we've seen a transition from you know the rises that occurred during the supply chain disruptions to now some of those prices normalizing but at some point those core good prices are no longer going to be normalizing and what they have to do is keep falling at the same rate to get this level of disinflationary pressure in the economy at the same time when we transition over to the services sector what we see is that services inflation in the us remains elevated of course part of this is the housing story but uh services x housing for services x housing also remains elevated reflective of the fact that nominal wage growth in the united states remains elevated compared to where we were in a pre-co period so you add that all up and um and basically drawing a straight line to say inflation is beat is a big bet that core goods inflation is going to continue to decelerate as rapidly as it has uh essentially in into the future and that we're um going to get enough labor market weakness that's going to bring down services price inflation which as i show on the first chart we really haven't seen all that much labor market deterioration over the course of the last year or so that has to be contextualized with this story which is essentially the most rapid interest rate cuts the only time we've seen interest rate cuts at this pace has been in the depths of the financial crisis and the depths of the 2000 tech bus and so uh at this point the market is all in not just on cutting rates as a function of some moderation of inflation but way beyond that essentially pricing in a near certainty that we're going into an immediate recession which would cause the fed to need to be uh aggressively accommodative uh given the uh given the pricing you know at a time when things are fine uh uh and you know with stock markets at all-time highs and spreads at alltime lows it's not like there's a lot of pressure from the financial economy to create a meaningful slowing of the us economy here now scanning to the next uh the next spot on our map which is europe we see basically the same dynamic in place where there has been one cut uh that's happened so far uh but the target rate remains about 140 basis points above what the 2-year interest rate the german 2-year interest rate is uh reflecting the fact that there are expectations of very aggressive european cuts ahead that's coming in a time when the unemployment rate is at multi-decade lows and services inflation you know headline inflation continues to be elevated core inflation continues to be elevated and in particular the service sector inflation uh they're shown on the right hand side in the gray line is really moving in the wrong direction when it comes to uh the ecb's goals here uh and so in that circumstance a tight labor market pretty good wage growth uh as a function of that a pretty poor productivity growth elevated services inflation elevated core inflation again you have to come back here and say look at what's priced in an aggressive easing cycle in the context of an economy that continues to have above target inflation and relatively uh tight labor markets and decent you know decent grow for the european context um you know not necessarily booming growth in any absolute sense but growth that is strong enough given the productivity to continue to keep labor markets relatively tight the uk another similar story which we see here uh in this case slightly less aggressive uh but uh despite you know we've had one cut so far um and we're still seeing two-year interest rates uh trading about 100 basis points below the current interest rate level it's notable uh that that you know that implies an aggressive easing cycle coming out of the uk which is notable considering uh the speech at jackson hall um from uh the boe governor that the desire was to be uh you know that inflation is not necessarily uh beat that you can't necessarily call victory and that the boe intends to to be slow moving in its behavior ahead and there's good reason for that when you look at the underlying fundamental conditions in the uk on the left- hand side the unemployment rate roughly at secular lows we saw another print this morning that was um you know that that was even better than what is shown on this chart uh and you see inflation that continues to be elevated particularly driven by services inflation which is particularly driven by wage inflation which is keeping overall inflation up and in fact the boe by its own uh projections expect uh that inflation will remain above target over the course of the next uh 18 months or so and so connecting back to what's going on in terms of the market pricing you see a very aggressive cutting cycle priced in at a time when you know growth conditions if anything are perking up a tad um and you're seeing you know strong labor market strong wage growth elevated inflationary pressures australia another example here um where uh you know the rba has been hesitant to cut uh given the continued inflationary pressures in the economy uh yet two years are trading about 70 basis points below what the current target rate is maybe not pricing in quite as an aggressive set of cuts as uh as in other locations but still a pretty uh significant easing cycle priced in and this is coming at a time when employment as a share of the population is also at secular highs pretty stable and at secular highs and where we continue to see australia inflation well above the rba's target uh predominantly driven by that elevated services inflation and the rba has been very clear about their hesitancy to enter an easing cycle given this combination of pressures certainly uh pushing off expectations of cuts in the short term uh and raising questions about whether they have the ability to cut interest rates much at all given the underlying inflationary pressures that they keep seeing in the economy now canada i think is an interesting case um because it is one of the places where uh there's a significant easing cycle priced in but where the macroeconomic conditions align with the type of conditions that would occur uh in you know type of conditions that align with an aggressive uh easing cycle and so you know most people don't really care about canada it's pretty small all things considered um for macro investors it's a market to trade but i think if anything it's it's for most investors for a broader uh investors with a broader perspective i think it's uniquely interesting because what it does is it it gives you a sense as the type of economy me that where these conditions are appropriate where conditions are aligned with a big easing cycle so you see some easing has already occurred and further easing is expected ahead and what's happening to align with that well you're seeing basically a rapid deterioration of the labor market conditions in canada uh we've seen the unemployment rate rise about a point and a half give or take um and its deterioration is uh accelerating and particularly um if you start to look at some of the private sector dynamics that are going on uh the deterioration is even more acute and more rapid uh and while canada continues to get a relatively elevated amount of immigration you know this is not an this is not a labor supply side story this is a significant deceleration in uh in the rate of uh job creation in the canadian economy and so you're seeing deterioration you're seeing accel some acceleration in that deterioration you're seeing a level of unemployment that looks more midcycle relative to what was going on in the previous cycle this is not a great scenario and you also see growth that's running at about zero um for an economy that has relatively strong uh employment growth so a per capita gdp number which is pretty clearly negative and so that that's an economy that needs some stimulation it certainly doesn't need restrictive interest rates and you also see on the inflation side inflation has uh come down now the bank of canada has a slightly different mandate because it's got a one to 3% mandate but you see basically uh that most inflation measures are basically at you know that 2% level well within their target range and and so this is the type of economy a rapidly deteriorating labor market one in which um you know one in which inflation is already back to the mandate where it makes sense to normalize interest rates uh to reduce restrictive interest rates in order to support the economy but that's a story that's totally different than what is going on in places like the us europe and the uk and australia very different story similar pricing but a very different story in fact the pricing in the us is far more aggressive uh over the course of the next 12 to 18 months than it is in canada despite canada having much weaker uh conditions in place and a more explicit commitment to an aggressive easing cycle of course in the developed world the one outlier is in japan um there's been a lot of talk in uh uh in the sort of uh mil of the macro world about how japan is likely to enter a tightening cycle there was some commentary from japanese policy makers at the boj um uh you know speaking to the the parliament there about you know the desire to normalize interest rates uh but certainly the markets have not really taken that to heart you know currently japanese short rates are at 25 basis points after the uh hike that happened a little bit earlier this summer and two-year interest rates are you know basically at the mid mid 0.3% range or pricing at about a 15 basis point increase that's certainly within the range of we'd call this not much tightening priced in expected uh in the short rate market and that makes a lot of sense when you look at what going on in japan there's no real reason to tighten in japan if you look on the leth hand side we show real gdp the level of japanese real gdp is actually below uh what it was in the pre-co period that's you know considerably weaker than what we've seen in other developed economies and japanese core inflation has moderated considerably and really for the last year has been running give or take around 1% that certainly doesn't make japan look like they have an inflation or any urgency to tighten and so it was not too surprising when we saw today that the bo that several members of the boj came out and said that there was very little urgency uh to tighten further so what tightening has occurred there has been through the exchange rate over the course of the last couple of months uh and th that move in the exchange rate will likely translate into lower price growth or slower price growth in uh in headline inflation as well helping uh them bring down that slightly elevated headline number uh in order to sort of basically the overall picture there is you know weak economic conditions weak inflation and you know more of the malays that we've seen over the course of many decades no urgency to titan in japan i'll wrap it up with one uh last place in here um turning our attention to china uh you know the the chinese uh debt depression and i use the word depression not to be uh uh bombastic i use word depression to describe a dynamic a depression is one in which uh there debt levels are sufficiently high that despite a decline in interest rates uh the private sector in particular is not in a position to take on more debt uh in order to create an economic re re acceleration in response to the policy easing that's what a that's what a depression is could also be called a deleveraging um but it's it's really uh it's meant to to um to describe a dynamic where uh we've broken out of a cyclical dynamic and we're now in um a self-reinforcing debt driven downturn and i think the chinese markets are really highlighting that we're seeing stocks move back to uh decade plus lows here and we're seeing the bond market also start to continue or seeing the bond market continue to fall to decade plus lows as well despite the fact that you know on both sides both in terms of the equity market and in terms of the bond market various policy initiatives have been put in place in order to intervene in those markets to prop equities up and to have bond yields not fall nearly as fast and despite those circumstances you see the markets just keep pushing uh and reflecting more of this del aaging or depression dynamic that's going on in that economy um that is uh that's the short story a little different i know than some of the previous uh presentations but i think the goal here really was to sort of look through across everything the biggest cross cutting dynamic is this dynamic that there is a global a relatively significant global easing price stand across these markets the economic conditions do not align with a significant global easing and the likely the biggest story that we're going to see over the course of the next three or six months is um is a recognition of this disconnect uh particularly in the bond market um as central banks are likely more hesitant to ease uh relative to what we've what we see priced into the market
Is Inflation Still a Problem in the U.S.?,2024-09-12 12:15:06+00:00,4,cO5DnZDEE5g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO5DnZDEE5g,and and there seems to be aort of growing consensus whether it's the markets pricing analysts or the fed themselves that in general inflation is no longer a problem are you are you in the same camp or not i i think uh i'd say not so fast uh on that front and the reason why that is is that um is that we we have uh we have two meaningful tests coming up on whether inflation has durably fallen uh to 2% first of all let's make sure we rem remind ourselves of the starting point inflation is not at 2% um 2% is the fed's target uh pce is still above 2% uh a lot of different ways you can slice it but between you know two and a half and 3% cpi is above that cor cpi is above that and so we're not at uh the fed's target in terms of inflation so that's our starting point remember that just to get to this point um it is taking remarkable goods disinflation over the course of the last 12 to 18 months now part of that has been a resolution of the supply chain issues that caused a big inflation spike but at this point when you look at things like core goods prices they're uh disinf lating or deflating at a level that was equivalent to or or even more negative than pre-co levels now do we think that we're in a world where you'd expect an extended period of core goods price deflation i don't think so and just the movement of that core goods price inflation back to something at pre-co levels or let's say above pre-co levels given you know the global de globalization dynamics and and tariff risks and you know various shipping issues there's a lot of reasons why you might think that core goods would end up uh prices would end up rising faster than they were um preco uh you know it services inflation still very elevated relative to pre-co so unless you get you have to have an extended period of very weak core goods prices to offset the elevated services price inflation in order to get to that 2% level and the real question is is that really going to happen or have we gone through a period basically we're had a price spike related to the supply chain issues a price normally ization related to the supply ch chain resolution issues and now we're going to go back to inflating in those prices so we haven't we haven't tested that and we haven't resolved it and if you think like any person who's like well inflation's 2% what they're saying is we will have relatively extreme core goods inflation forever uh and i don't think that that's a reasonable expectation so that's point number one point number two is let's say we actually get these cuts we're going to get probably some number of cuts um the question is do we get a re acceleration of the economy economy as a function of those cuts uh we're already starting to see you know mortgage applications for refinancing start to accelerate do we start to pick up more activity as a function of that easing um that would be a particularly concerning circumstance because we are not at 2% right so having a reacceleration of the economy at a time when inflation has not yet reached the fed's mandate is another test to see whether inflation is durably back down to 2% um you know central banks through time have learned that when you start to cut before you get inflation back to your mandate that is often uh that often leads to uh you know a a a second rise uh in inflation and and that's the risk that the fed uh has in front of itself if uh if it continues you know if it if it cuts aggressively at this point
Why is the Current US Economy Like the 50's and 60's?,2024-09-11 12:15:05+00:00,3,pPt16HRs72c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPt16HRs72c,in your eyes are there certain historical parallels to this type of cycle i mean is it the case that the cycles in the 70s and ' 80s were more income driven you know rather than the ones we saw in the 2000s yeah i i think the the the most relevant cycles that come to my mind are back in the 50s and 60s um you know there you had uh particularly post world war ii a generation that was coming out of you know the depression was familiar to them uh and they were very very reticent to take on new borrowing in order to finance their spending and so most of the expansions that occurred in the 50s and the 60s were they were predominantly income driven expansions low credit low borrowing mostly income oriented expansions um and i think in in many ways similar to you know us households went through a very painful experience in the global financial crisis um and you know people have been very reticent to lever up as a fun of that experience um over the last 15 years uh and so you know that that is very similar uh in that sense now you know expansions in the 50s and the 60s pretty much no one uh trading today uh has any direct experience uh other than maybe being little kids in the 50s and the 60s uh expansion so that's why i think it's one of these cases where people are drawing are always look to their personal experience to to to use to develop the and apply the heuristics that they've developed over the course of their careers and those are just not that not as relevant today as they as essentially studying previous cases like uh those those cycles i think the 50s and the 60s are also interesting because as you as you said it comes after the second world war of course we had the depression before that which was like the global financial crisis today and then the war you could say was a bit like covid in terms of uh you know the economy was shut down massive government spending so you kind of had something similar to kind of a wartime shut down of economy reopening uh so you had a kind of a covid effect today so there are lots of parallels that that we have to that period yeah i think that that's that's a that's a that's a good uh parallel to draw both the uh depression or deleveraging environment and then the wartime type spending of course uh during covid a lot shorter time you know all that was sort of compressed in a lot shorter time frames um but you know certainly in the in the core of our of our personal experience
Has Fed Policy Been Restricitve?,2024-09-10 12:15:03+00:00,6,MQ-C0l8GxLs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ-C0l8GxLs,so so how how do you look at the you know what the fed's done are we restrictive or not and and the impact on the economy of of of fed policy yeah i i think um if you if you look at this question of uh our interest rate hikes or the current level of interest rates uh you know very restrictive or not restrictive that question is that's an empirical question that's not a theoretical question i think there's a lot of um people who get uh sort of uh wrapped up in what is rstar and what is neutral and theoretical reasons why it should be one level or another um and i think for people who trade markets uh in the day-to-day like who cares what some theoretical arstar is like what you care about is are interest rates high enough to slow the economy or not um and i think when you look at that question um the the it's not it's not like interest rates have had no effect on the economy there have had some effect particularly for those um borrowers who are who need incremental borrowing to sustain themselves have faced much painfully higher interest rates and so the most liquidity sensitive sectors have experienced a significant tightening uh as a function of that and so you see like the most sensitive liquidity liquidity sensitive se like venture capital loss making enterprises like that you know a lot of them have are have failed are failing prices have fallen a lot etc the issue is at an economy-wide level those sectors are just like are not that sensitive and not that big a deal relative to the overall economy most of the overall economy is cash flow positive you know whether you're talking about businesses or households um you know their cash flow positive they're not borrowing a lot of money and so therefore it's not that the interest rates have had no effect they just haven't had that much of an effect and certainly haven't been able to overwhelm the income growth effect both for households as well as for corporations um over the course of the last couple of years and so you're seeing a slower economy than would otherwise occur if those rates hadn't risen but not one that is you know not certainly not very restrictive like i i think this idea i almost have to chuckle every time someone uh talks about very restrictive monetary policy like let let me tell you a story about very restrictive monetary policy like very restriced monetary policy means stocks are going down credit spreads are going up the economy is slowing rapidly like where are where in the world is very restrictive monetary policy credit spreads are at lows stocks are at highs the economy is grown at three two to 3% real for the last eight quarters like what on earth do you look at to say this is very restrictive monetary policy except theory some theoretical notion of our st yeah i mean some some people are pointing to things like weakness in the manufacturing sector the pmis are weak they're pointing to you know jumping the unemployment rate recently where it it broke you know it moved above the so-cal s rule um you know people look at the performance of stocks outside of magnificent 7 which has been relatively weak so so you know because of all of those things people have started to talk a lot more about okay there is something happening here we are about to hit a recession well i there's a there's a um there's a big difference between a late cycle moderation uh as a function of tighter monetary policy uh and uh and the idea that monetary policy is very restrictive and we're falling fast into a recession right th those two things are just they're just very different stories like and i think i think what's coloring people's view of this sort of dynamic is the credit driven cycles because it's true credit driven cycles are acute on the downside because they're self-reinforcing on the downside which is typically a very high borrowing and then that starts to slow which deteriorates asset prices and incomes and balance sheets and that creates further deleveraging and further deleveraging but that's not what's going on here what's going on here is a very very gradual slowing of economic conditions it's true yep uh the unemployment rates up what 70 basis points over the course of the last year but it was at 3.5% 3.4% you know it's not like we're talking about something that is like a disaster here we're talking about a very gradual slowing not to mention the fact the unemployment rate is the weakest essentially of all of the labor market indicators or let's talk about manufacturing capacity utilization is at a 25 it's at the 25 year average so it's moderated a little bit but we're not talking about you know you want to talk about a recession you know we're not close to a recession here in terms of the manufacturing sector and so i think people are trying you know it paid for a long time to try and get ahead of the immediate downturn type dynamic um particularly when you were talking about credit driven cycles so once the once there was some moderation it was self-reinforcing to the downside and that's created a trained behavior where people think that just because i see some weakness somewhere means that we're going to collap you know the economy is going to collapse and look what have we learned over the course of the last three years which is that um a weakness in one area or some signs of softening are not good predictors of the path of the overall economy uh and monetary policy and i you know i think we're seeing the same thing largely play out again today
What is the Promise Of AI for Productivity Growth?,2024-09-09 12:15:01+00:00,5,AEAQhO0drYw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEAQhO0drYw,you know you look at the productivity dynamics there's a lot of promise hope talk future uh thinking about what's going on what's going to happen with productivity and then when you look at the hard macro data like actually productivity over the last couple of years has been across the developed world has been uh the worst that it's been in decades um and so i don't see it but it doesn't mean it might not happen but that's the main that's the main rests yeah there was one post specifically about ai in regard to that yeah yeah i was going to ask about that you said the the the promised ai boom may be coming in the future but for now it's looking like a yawn from a macroeconomist perspective that's right when when macroeconomists see flat lines uh you know they uh they don't get too excited i think um i you know uh technological innovation um and projecting technological innovation and the productivity impact of it i think is one of the structurally most challenging things from uh from the perspective trading markets or or being uh from a macro perspective um isn't that funny bob that's one of the things people feel most certain about isn't it in any given moment right and i think that that's right is is that is that um i think it's in particular challenging because folks don't necessarily uh appreciate the baseline dynamics that have to occur so as a simple example i i post that exact thing about uh about about ai not having an effect and uh or not seeing an increase in overall productivity whether it's have any effect or not let's leave that aside not seeing that overall increase productivity and then you know a typical response is well i know someone whose productivity was increased as a function of using chat gpt and that's not the question when you're thinking about macro when you're thinking from a macroeconomic perspective what the impact of a technology innovation is on productivity it's not whether someone's benefit it's whether someone has benefited substantially more than has the techn technological innovation that has occurred before so as a simple example um like compare personal computing to an apple iphone to uh you know to an iphone to chat pt now from my perspective when you look at that in order to get productivity to accelerate prod growth to accelerate you actually have to have those subsequent technological innovations make us even more productive productive at an even faster rate not that they make us more productive because of course they make us more productive there's always technology that makes us more productive every day we become more productive right because there's always some incremental technology but to get more growth to get faster growth it has to make you more productive even faster and so i think that's one of the challenges that's all that always exists with technology with with um framing technological innovation and having the right perspective of technological innovation the question is not does it help the question is is it accelerating your productivity at a rate that is meaningfully faster than all the innovations that happened before i think that's the perspective it's super challenging for people to get their heads around because it's very hard to understand like uh indoor plumbing like do do you have an appreciation of how big a deal indoor plumbing was i don't i've always lived with indoor plumbing you know so you know uh but it was a big deal you know i mean it was a radical difference air conditioning refrigeration like these are things that were radical shifts in terms of uh productivity uh enhancement but we have no idea what they were like because we've always lived with them so we don't we can't look back at that 60s data and really appreciate how big a deal those were relative to like you know my iphone 15 vers is my iphone 14 versus i don't know my iphone 6
Insights Into Industrial Commodities,2024-09-06 12:15:07+00:00,4,kHFOaZR15lw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHFOaZR15lw,what about commodities bob um that you know there have been a couple really stellar performers here in the past i don't know year or so copper had a nice run it's backed off gold's doing pretty well um we talked about gold i know what um do you own any i'm simply put yeah well i think i think industrial commodities i think are really interesting um from uh from a let's say a long cycle perspective because the the challenge with industrial eies and you sort of made reference to this uh earlier which is that like the production of copper today is a function of what decisions people made 10 to 15 years ago right and what the demand was the perspective demand was 10 or 15 years ago and basically there's nothing you could do about it like you know on the margin you can try and scrap and you can try and get more out of a mine or whatever but like it takes 10 to 15 years to uh to start a m and produce and so we basically are seeing a circumstance where the uh production uh of these of the mine supply across you know a bunch of different let's say on the metals side of things is um is not projected to keep up with the demand now uh because the mine supply was done during you know was essentially set during a more depressed macroeconomic environment and particularly as you start to look at many of the metals um you know next generation uh you know activities are expected to use a fair amount of those metals which is gonna you know risks creating a squeeze now will the squeeze be as bad as what sort of two lines on the chart predict probably not because there's always efficiency and then there's you know replacement and you know whatever people are pretty smart about how how to make these things more and more efficient but there's general idea that we're going to transition let's say to a increasingly green oriented world without stantial use of industrial metals which are undersupplied in the context of you know supply being set 10 or 15 years ago like that story seems pretty compelling and that story will likely flow through to other prices throughout the economy right and maybe with the caveat that like if this economic weakness that we talked about materializes um you know that bed is temporarily off you know those those right the prices get hurt you know of course of course and there's and there's i mean part of this is there's sort of a strategic portfolio point and then there's tactical positioning and of course you know in some ways because metals are the um most marginal demand element um and because the uh supply is generally fixed um they're actually you know some of the best captures of incremental demand incremental global demand i should say um in a way that's a little different than oil because oil oil traditionally oil was thought of as having a relatively fixed supply and demand being the primary driver but what we've seen really in the last 10 years since i guess the mid-2010s is that um supply actually is um is pretty uh price sensitive and responsive through the creation you know of all the shale and related activities which means that um you know it's it's less oil is less is more supply sensitive um than uh than a lot of the metal side of uh of markets these days
"Inflation, TIPS and Nominal Bonds",2024-09-05 12:15:00+00:00,6,abP7UgyQj8s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abP7UgyQj8s,like if you if you're a long-term saver um the the biggest threat you actually have to your savings is is inflation right that that is the biggest threat eroding your purchasing power and i think too often investors don't think about um how do you preserve uh purchasing power over an extended period of time and how do you reduce volatility related to purchasing power right so i think this was this has been actually a very interesting three years because if you're a 6040 portfolio or for instance if you overweight bonds let's say you're getting near retirement and you were overweight bonds you had a double whammy of bonds falling in value and inflation obviously rising substantially in now yeah and you put those two things together and that is uh that is killer for a portfolio right um and so looking at your savings portfolio and saying not how do i optimize a nominal return but how do i minimize the amount of volatility that i'm getting on the long-term ra return i think is very important so a simple example right now is if i'm thinking about a long-term savings portfolio and say i'm looking at treasury inflation protected securities they're offering a two to you know 2.5% two to 2.5% yield real yield that pays that in real terms plus realized inflation now is realized inflation perfect of course it's not perfect i wouldn't you know but it's not worth getting too hung up on that like if inflation's high you're going to get paid more and if inflation's low then you'll be fine and you'll get that real yield acral that's a good asset from a long-term savers portfolio right like let me tell you you know getting a guaranteed or close to guaranteed outcome of a two to 2.25% real yield over a 30-year time frame you know it's pretty tough to actually beat that um particularly when you think about the risk-taking that would have to happen on top of it now you still want to think about like you know there's still possibilities that the us government could devalue those bonds in various ways so you might want to also hold gold and other assets commodities and other assets in addition to that um but that's a good example of if you're just thinking about nominal returns you might say let me go buy those bonds those nominal bonds right now if you're thinking about real returns how to reduce real volatility then you get drawn to assets like gold tips commodities you know commodity plays etc that are much better at preserving purchasing power okay tips um so i need tips nobody talks about them yeah i know yeah i feel maybe we need to wake the listener up a little of tips oh boy okay yeah it's the most the thing with tips i always i i think people people just don't understand how they how they work i think a lot of times and it seems like i don't maybe you could explain explain to people maybe just briefly how that how they actually uh function you know how you're able yeah well i think um i think the challenge with tips is that um they sound like an inflation protected asset um which they are because tips pay you actual realized inflation plus a real yield that's how they're quoted that's what they pay i think the the challenge that most people see with them or experien with them is you think you have a inflation protected security as an example long-term tips in the last uh in the last you know three years have gone down 40 or 50% and you're like inflation's up tips are down i'm confused i thought i was protected from inflation right that's exactly but that's because tips are a real bond a real yield bond and so real interest rates have risen so one of the challenges with tips if you go back three three years was the real yield on those assets was negative meaningfully negative which means by buying those assets you were locking in a destruction of your purchasing power that's a bad asset to buy just to be blunt like yeah you know there's lots of ways for instance if you just hold cash cash like yielding cash t bills or the equivalent you look across countries across time offers typically offers a modest positive real return uh across countries across time so like why would you buy something that destroys your value in terms of the yield when you could just hold cash but what's happened subsequently is that the real yield on those bonds has gone up a lot right up to that two to two and a half percent depending on the day and because of that now the expected future return of tips is very different than it was before and so you're getting that real return on a forward-looking basis and so that's why i think today they're a much more compelling asset class from a valuation perspective and from that inflation protection certainly than they were a few years ago when were basically locking in terrible returns right and inflation that tips pay that's cpi year-over-year they yep they pay they pay printed cpi which like look you know i'm not not going to say cpi is a perfect instantiation of the inflationary pressures of the economy like yeah i think there's all sorts of reasons why you why you might um think that it's imperfect but it's certainly better than not getting paid that uh accumulated uh return
What Could Drive Elevated Inflation?,2024-09-04 12:15:03+00:00,4,Qzl6F3hxg1g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzl6F3hxg1g,what do you think the prospect is of you know and maybe this is something that that um illuminates that the the shift or the issues with 6040 you know moving ahead like what do you think the prospect is of that we're in a higher inflationary period i'm talking about like multi- decades you know uh compared to what it's been um and that you know if the fed cuts rates now it's just it's going to be kind of smaller because uh they're not going to be able to cut as much and then we'll have that inflationary kind of rebound and then that's where my head's at i'm trying to figure out like all right the fed cuts now and inflation's still you know still higher than it has been uh in relatively recent history like what you know what happens next after that well i think the idea that we're going to be in a higher inflationary environment ahead um seems pretty compelling to me than the last 20 or 30 years what i first emphasize is if you're holding 6040 the portfolio you're holding is essentially an you know a position that is hugely underweight uh higher inflationary dynamics so just start off at 6040 it's basically saying there will be secular disinflation and strong growth happening for the next 30 years just as it has for the last 30 years and so even if you were just to get to neutral meaning like you were balanced to the possibility that we might have higher inflation or not in the next you know 20 you know the next 10 20 30 years that would mean getting away from the 6040 portfolio as your baseline uh and i think there's probably compelling reasons why it probably is higher than average that probability is higher than average because of the dynamics that we've seen like basically we had globalization and uh no conflict over the course of 20 or 30 years like if you look at the conflict side of things um you know we basically had the number the you know through 2000 through 2020 we had the lowest number of deaths in global conflicts per capita as we' had basically in 1500 years uh in in the global economy now am i predicting that it will necessarily go up i i'm not necessarily predicting it that it'll go up but it certainly it has risen and i wouldn't necessarily assume that we would fall back to that trajectory i was just reading the financial times today and it's like a war in ukraine a war in gaza a war in mly like how you know it's like war war war war and um and that is important because wars are inflationary no matter how you no matter how you look at it wars are inflationary whether you think they're just wars or unjust wars or whatever it doesn't really matter it's definitely inflationary because it involves creating stuff and destroying and also destroying the infrastructure that exists there and then having to rebuild it again and so i think that part of things like is really um you know tilts the probabilities are tilted towards more conflict ahead and certainly the momentum is in that direction uh and then in terms of globalization you we're clearly past peak globalization you know the geopolitical circumstance is you know folks are pulling apart whether say a trump administration gets elected uh and pursues a tariff policy or they don't get elected and you know the existing administration uh you know pursues other ways in which efforts are made to put up trade barriers um you one form or another trade barriers capital barriers uh geopolitical integration are is definitely going to be lower in the future than it has been in the past and so that also is inflationary because it means you have to duplicate supply chains and duplicate infrastructure versus just using the lowest cost producer globally
Yield Curve vs Stock Market Expectations,2024-09-03 12:15:05+00:00,6,v5lRFEPSRQM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5lRFEPSRQM,bonds versus equities and i'll tell you what i mean so you know we're still inverted the 10 years is like 4.1 or two or something percent and you know t bills one months are like 5.3 it's so you know it's like 100 basis points and um and when i look at you know the stock market seems really expensive if you look at cape ratio or and you know some people talk about concentration too in the top names um and there are other ways to look at it um market cap the gdp or whatever so it seems to me like you know we're getting this this vibe as everyone likes to say from the fed that you know cuts are coming which is not always a wonderful thing but people seem to think it is wonderfully bullish so if if like on the forward curve of of the short end of the the rayer like the the expectation is down and we're still like inverted 100 basis points in the 10e and stuff i me it seems to me like you could easily get a situation where the reaction to whatever happens geopolitically fed policy whatever it is pushes that 10year up kind of substantially and i don't i think at at current levels i'm not sure equities would like that very much that's sort of my concern right now i think that that is um i think that's a very reasonable concern um and part part of the challenge in trading markets is and particularly when you start trading bond markets is like you have to trade against what's priced in and what's priced in is to be frank like a very fast cutting cycle right you know what's priced in is by next summer will be at 350 and we're at you know 525 to 550 right now that you know those sorts of cuts is it possible of course it's possible but those are the sorts of cuts that would come you know in a relatively substantial deceleration you know it's we're getting we're getting close to one cut every meeting starting uh in september and you know that's a you know remember back when the fed was hiking at that level of aggression you know inflation was very very elevated right they were behind the curve of inflation was very elevated that sort of cutting cycle it's not quite a crisis cutting cycle but it is a uh would be consistent with a recessionary environment um you know relatively steep recessionary environment and so it's not clear that that's going to happen and as you say you know if the cuts don't come then you know yields will rise and if yields rise it will directly affect the economy but also affect equities directly through rising discount rates right and i feel like even like less cut than expected at at this point is like hawkish right it's like go ahead you know you cut whatever you know they usual quarter quarter you know their 25 point cuts or whatever and maybe that's like a lot less over the next you know some months than expected and that scene you know is kind of hawkish uh it just it it feels like like a a risky moment frankly to me yeah i mean i think for financial assets it is a risky moment because you have such essentially such extreme expectations priced in in stocks you have um you know it's not just that you have the various ratios that you refer to as being elevated which they certainly are but actually i think one of the important things is almost all those ratios are priced off of forward earnings um and it's important to recognize forward earnings are not actual earnings that's right you know people people are sort of like well forward earnings like that's you know it's obvious you know that that's what the baseline is okay well like when the earnings get delivered then they earnings not until they get the loan right and so i think we have um on the stock side ev valuation you know extreme valuations but also relatively extreme earnings growth expectations you know in the mid double digits to high double digits over the course of the next 18 months that's very very high for a late cycle environ you know for a late cycle economy to get that sort of earnings growth and on the flip side we have very high expectations of easing in the bond market and you sort of have in many ways like an expectation bubble going on right now in both the stock market and the bond market that can that are intersecting each other as you know and um could easily be disappointed simply you know if the fed is just a little more cautious than expectations and maybe if you know growth just doesn't quite deliver the extremity of the um earnings expectations that are currently priced in right so what do you do about it what do you buy i mean uh cash exactly
Might Inflation Come back to 2%?,2024-09-02 12:15:01+00:00,3,AkAZJJyL_kA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkAZJJyL_kA,if we talk about the inflation picture um i i think the basic question continues to be will inflation come durably back to 2% now we've had a couple of good months of inflation data and i think that's a very you know that that that's been a positive uh in terms of giving some signs that we might be moving in that direction uh but the question is is that going to be sustainable um and you know i'd say the is still out about whether that will be sustainable odds are more likely than not that we're going to at least be in this 2 to 3% range which is better than the picture that we were seeing earlier in the year but still is uncertain about whether or not um will actually sustainably be there and so a lot of the calls for 50 basis point cuts uh and um and and a lot of the pricing that exists in the in the short rate market related to the fall and inflation was really focused driven by this really acute what you see here in the middle acute slowdown in the uh inflation rate for these various super core elements uh as well as an acute slowdown of what happened in rent of primary residents and oar uh and interestingly enough you know those measures in part bounced back uh over the course uh you know in in the most recent report and when you take a step back and just basically scan um what's going on with inflation various inflation surveys of households of businesses of landlords basically say hey look does it look like there is a widespread collapse in price growth in the economy as would be indicated by these measures the answer is very clear that there is no signs of widespread collapse in price growth in the economy businesses aren't seeing it consumers aren't seeing it landlords aren't seeing it if anything you see some indic across all those that uh price growth might be a touch higher than where we were last summer and so the fed is appropriately cautious when they look at this measured inflation data and they say maybe we shouldn't be so confident to peg the last three months and say well the last three months are the way that they are um and and extrapolate that out into the future particularly when you see the sort of dynamics that we saw in the reporting that we saw in the report that we saw yesterday which is a lot of the things that were super disinflationary actually bounced back in the recent period uh and and so really calls into question is this really going to be sustainable or not part of the reason why the fed waited till se till september is because they're going to take in another inflation report a pce uh inflation report as well as an unemployment report between today and then and they'll make the call appropriately then
Equity Market Volatility,2024-08-30 12:15:05+00:00,4,qGYGDv_GGHs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYGDv_GGHs,the last couple of uh uh the last c 10 days basically 10 tr days have been quite a world whirlwind and i and i just wanted to to emphasize when you look at these sorts of volatility shocks you know we had we basically had very very low volatility for inan period of time and and naturally when you have this low volatil when you have a low volatility environment um a lot of financial entities will lever up in order to both take advantage of that low volatility environment but also as part of almost a mechanical uh var targeting type uh set of work that they're doing and a big part of the low volatility environment particularly the low pric and volatility environment was related to f selling by a variety of agents in the market that very very acutely switched you know back 10 days ago and typically when you see these sorts of v spikes they typically are followed by a period of deleveraging amongst financial actors what's notable about this period relative to those previous periods is that we have reversed ev all spike faster uh than has ever existed in the last you know almost 40 years of uh volatility behavior um in part that's driven by the fact that the fall sellers are highly incentivized to keep selling in order and and as a result keep volatility price volatility low it's also a reflection of you know on the margin incrementally good uh data that was sort of uh a bit more sanguin than what was concerned about than the concerns that existed before what i'd say about these is that these sorts of v spikes it's still the jury is still out about whether there's going to be a broader deleveraging that plays out certainly if you look back um even in 2018 um you saw periods uh you know weaker asset prices on a forward looking basis we haven't seen that yet but it does necessarily mean that it won't persist as deleveraging type dynamics and reassessments of risk do take time to be fully reflected in the holdings of financial asset holders particularly leverage financial asset holders so it may play out in the future um but regardless of whether it does or does not i think that magnitude of volatility spike during that period what it really highlights is the fragility of a late cycle environment where you know to be frank the unemployment report that we saw uh in the friday before that fall spike was certainly not an unusual uh set of information um and it created a heck of a repricing of expectations of fed policy the us bond yield stocks etc and so and that was really that was really the impetus which i'll talk about in a minute that was really the impetus that created the knockon effects when you see those sorts of market action dynamics if you've been around this business long enough you look at that and you say man that shows a lot of sort of fragility under the hood and actually if for regular viewers of this macro webinar if you go back a month ago i was highlighting how you know you can just sort of see in the market action that there was a bit of a liquidity tightening that was going on and you could see it in a very variety of different places in the market and then you know got a you not a huge shock but a modest shock and it created that of gapping in terms of risk assessment uh and and acute deleveraging among amongst financial entities and so i think if not this instance what it highlights is that uh the market is certainly vulnerable to shifts in expectations uh and doesn't necessarily have the sort of liquidity uh and robustness that you might have expected you know six 12 18 months ago
Are AI Potetnial Earnings Expecations Reasonable?,2024-08-29 12:15:05+00:00,8,moJqA_dsecg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moJqA_dsecg,i think the ai related spending uh and and essentially what is priced in what is priced in to the market related to ai i think is one of the most important questions uh that an equity investor should be thinking through as they're buying the market not just the ai names which i talked about but how is ai expected to influence the totality of the market now this is a case where um i think it's important from uh analysis perspective that instead of uh having a strong view in one direction or another it's important to start with an understanding of what's priced in and then think about the plausibility of that dynamic happening and so what i've done with this work here is i basically said look take as a given the expectations uh that are being talked about related to ai when it comes to to uh the the next say eight years um from the techno optimus just take it take it as it for granted that this is what is actually going to transpire how much would that path forward support equities relative to say where they were priced i don't know post svb right as i think is a good benchmark because that's really where you know the ai story started to get meaningfully influencing the equity markets and so on the left hand side what you see uh this is from bloomberg is basically a view of what the expected investment uh related to ai will be over time uh until it starts to sort of level out as a share of total tech related infrastructure and so you see moving from uh you know the last year which was uh if you can see it was basically six $65 billion with expectations that by 2032 it would rise to $1.4 trillion so that investment let's just assume that that is entirely earned that those sales related to that investment is entirely earned by s&p500 uh companies let's also assume that there is a massive boom in labor productivity related to ai um and here in the middle chart what we show is uh jp morgan has penciled out what the possible path of ai uh of improvement in productivity could be from ai uh basically penciling out something that is uh about uh twice as fast as the impact of the personal computer uh and about 50% larger so let's call that 2% in terms of a productivity benefit uh on an annualized basis well what does that get you if you put that together what does that get you in terms of increased revenue growth right revenue growth from the investment revenue growth from the increased productivity and what you see here is basically what you get is you know let's say the baseline us nominal gdp growth is about 4% nominal you add in that ai spend of 1.5 trillion uh by 2032 you get you know you add about 70 basis points of revenue growth uh and then you add in that 2% productivity growth uh and you you get something that's in the ballpark of just over 5% uh you know uh or just over 6% i'm sorry uh total uh earnings growth uh in the future so you know what does that mean well that is um you know transitioning from uh let's say something like uh 4% earnings growth to something like six to six and a half percent earnings growth you know that certainly would be beneficial uh to stocks but you're not talking about something over the course of the next eight years uh that would be a huge influence on stocks that's something you know on the order of hundreds of uh billions of dollars hundreds of billions of dollars in incremental earnings by 2032 so what would you pay for if you knew that there were hundreds of billions of dollars of incremental earnings let's say 5500 billion dollars of incremental earnings that would come by 2032 what would you pay for that even if you paid 20 times today you know you're not talking about uh relative to a a us uh market cap that's something like $50 trillion you're really not talking about a huge influence on stock pric is certainly a benefit but not a huge influence so this on the surface this is not enough to get you to the point where you're talking about stocks you know nearly doubling as a function of the ai story so how do you get to stocks nearly doubling of an ai story it has to come through margins and i think that's the important thing to recognize is many techno optimists will talk about how the ai revolution will create you know earnings growth that will persist in the double digits uh to the mid double dig the the most extreme techno optimists will talk in those terms if you uh pencil that out in order to get mid even low mid double even low double digigit returns uh growth rates in terms of earnings what you would have to do is get something like a 1% margin increase each year i want to emphasize each year you'd have to get a 1% margin increase and so what would that mean well if you take a look at what that would look like historically what it would it would do it would be to transfer the uh create a transition where corporate margins move from where they are right now which is about 12 or 13% up to 21% over the course of the next eight years representing the single greatest boom in corporate margins that has ever existed that is what is necessary and and by a mine right to to multiples of where they've been on a long-term basis now could that happen certainly could happen one of the challenges with margin expansion and particularly margin expansion when it leads to a reduction in costs particularly labor costs is who is going to pay for the goods and services that are resultant right so many companies will talk about hey look i was able to fire you know 90% of my my workforce in a particular area in order you know leveraging a that that would a sort of a typical corporate stor um the thing that doesn't get and then that sort of gets extrapolated well hey look we can just you know essentially gain all of that in terms of reduced headcount and maintain our topline revenue but one of the most important things that anyone who lived through the tech boom learned was that one person's income is their spending and if you lay off a bunch of people you're not going to get spending to continue at the same rate unless someone else dis saves and so that's the basic question is if you're going to get the sort of earnings growth that is essentially priced in and this this priced in earnings growth you know would be enough to basically double the s&p 500 from where we were in the in the post svv period if you put 20 times earnings on it in order to get this kind of uh earnings growth and this kind of sales growth some other sector some sector of the economy has to then change their savings rate to tove in order in exact offset of the margin increase that you see in the corporate sector
Does The Fed Need to Normalize Rate?,2024-08-28 12:15:00+00:00,4,2zAC3oV3ZLo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zAC3oV3ZLo,well that begs the question as to whether or not they need to move rates at all i mean the inflation rate has been coming down naturally on its own with uh with rates maintaining the way they are so why why bother changing things well i think that you know that's a good question as i said if you just look at if you were to take the path of what's happened out and i were to just drop you into an economy you know at some random time and i said growth is you know two to three% uh inflation's 2 to 3% stocks are at alltime highs spreads are at alltime lows uh and interest rates have been basically where they are today you know for the last two years what what would be the typical response and i think the typical response would be to not do much because it you know the economy is generally growing fine asset prices seem strong inflation's still a little too hot and therefore you probably shouldn't you know aggressively cut but i think what's happening is we're looking at the path getting to this point rather than looking at this point uh objectively and thinking okay well then they've got to go nor normaliz rates there's no reason to normalize rates unless there is a growth impulse to normalize rates uh or to to lower rates and i think that sort of speaks to the general point which is that if you've been through these market dynamics over time over the decades what you see is there's constantly this view we're going to go return to normal when in reality central banks move a lot slower in returning to normal and what is normal than uh than people expect and and i think we're setting up for the same exact thing remember there were seven cuts priced in for 2024 starting you know as of december a year ago right and and that has not and that did not get delivered not close to being delivered and yet uh people are speaking with the same confidence that we're gonna get 200 basis points of cuts over the next 12 months as they did back then even though the short rate market was dead wrong back then given the economic conditions the the theme of last year 2023 up until i would say november or even october was everyone calling not everyone but a lot of people calling for a recession i think bears overwhelmed the bulls last year that's more or less at least on media that i've observed that's more or less balanced out why fundamentally did the bears get it wrong last year if you were to look hindsights 2020 but the major did not yeah the bears did not get it fundamentally wrong last year that's an important thing to remember what happened was yeah what happened was there was the greatest easing uh of financial conditions supported by the fed treasury on november 1st that arrested the declines in asset markets that were going on right so what you had was not was not the market left to its own uh dynamics would have continued to sell off both stocks and bonds would have continued to sell off but what happened was you had a monetary and fiscal policy uh intervention in the markets to arrest those behaviors and create another leg up uh in the stock market and leg up in the bond market and so that was the dynamic was you know an unexpected and to be honest like not a particularly um not a particularly fundamentally driven easing uh effort by the fed and the treasury which reversed the market action
What do Job Revisions Indicate About the Unemployment Rate and Fed Cuts?,2024-08-27 12:15:04+00:00,4,XYpOdezo5Xo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYpOdezo5Xo,"let's talk about uh fed policy itself so i'm looking at today's data for example so today's news non-farmer payable growth revives down by 88,000 according to labor department a magnitude not seen since 2009 in terms of a downward revision uh says here the bls said the actual job growth was nearly 30% less than the initially reported figure uh last month so the how is going to impact fed policy at all keeping in mind it's not goingon to not going to impact fed policy at all and the reason why that is is is because basically these revisions were known um we could go down the rabbit hole of talking about qcw revisions but the gist is that um that every year there is a revision this data is for april uh of 2023 through march of 2024 so it's very stale and old it's not reflected or influen it doesn't influence uh the printed unemployment rate because that comes from a different survey and the big picture is like during that period employment was pretty good getting you know something like 175,000 jobs a year or a a month for an economy that you know whose natural rate of employment growth is probably and labor force growth is probably closer to 100,000 so we went from a very strong job market to a you know decent job market based upon those revisions and those people who follow this closely uh we already saw signs of this revision happening in previous quarters and so this is a very incremental piece of information and and the markets took it that way as well in the sense that markets didn't meaningfully move on the news well forward looking then uh can you give us some guidance in terms of how the uh the labor market can progress or evolve from here 4.3% with the latest unemployment reading is it going to take higher bob do you think i think we're in a in a process of gradually slowing gradually slowing economy as interest rates have been elevated for an extended period of time but that sing is very gradual the unemployment rate shift is probably the weakest indicator of any indicator whether in the labor market or the broader economy and partially overstated by the fact that it was driven up by a substantial amount of new entrance as well as temporary job layoffs um and so we're unlikely to see an acceleration at the pace that we've seen in the last couple of months that were influenced by those sort of transitory or one-off factors much more likely what we'll see is a gradual uh mandering up of uh unemployment uh very slowly uh and a gradual slowing of gdp but at a big picture level this is not an economy uh that you know if if you have an economy that's growing in a real basis at two to three% uh and you have inflation that's still at two to three% and you have stocks at alltime highs and spreads at alltime lows that's not a combination of dynamics that is consistent with 200 basis points of fed cuts in the course of 12 months it's totally inconsistent with that okay so you think the markets are too aggressive in pricing in how many cuts we're getting so how many do you think we are going to get realistically going into next year well if your trading markets the question isn't necessarily you don't have to pick your cuts uh precisely um but what i'd say is i think it's going to be a pretty slow process you know we're talking about a handful of cuts through the course of the next 12 months nothing like uh i guess the eight cuts that 825 basis point cuts that are priced in and certainly if you even just look at the september numbers you know the market pricing today is it is still for something it's about a 60 40 on 50 basis point cut um if you look at the fed minutes that were released today nothing indicates that there would be a move for 50 basis points you would have to see a incredible weakening uh of the labor market in the one print that we have between now and september to get anything close to that it seems highly improbable that you would get 50 basis points of cuts given what we're seeing comprehensively with the labor data"
What Caused the Global Market Reactions in Early August 2024?,2024-08-26 12:15:00+00:00,4,2Bl4LkF4PQc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Bl4LkF4PQc,i want to talk about systemic risk and acute market moves which you brought up earlier so let's address the last semi-acute market move we had earlier in the month uh it was less pronounced here in the us but globally like korea for example august 5th november uh august 5th and the n uh was uh was down so much that the they had to uh uh trigger the um circuit breakers but anyway what caused that there's been debate as whether or not the the yen car trade and was the sole cause what do you stand on this well you know i study what hedge funds how hedge funds were positioned for a living uh and it built technology that lets me see what's going on and a lot of the driver of what we saw was the second and third order consequences of hedge funds being caught off sides and other leverage investors being caught off sides on certain positions which created second and third order knock on effects in the global asset markets and so really what happened was this all started with a slightly softer cpi report which created a rotation away from growth stocks into the russell 2k stocks by that was july right you're talking about july yeah by july by market neutral hedge funds that then created increased perceptions of risk which caused broader hedge fund and levered books start to delever um particularly where they were over positioned which was really in places like the stock market um and so what was happening was those levered entities those levered uh hedge funds were what they were doing was trying to catch up on returns by going long high growth stocks and when those underperformed they had to cut those books that created a draw down in the stock market which created concerns about the fact that the fed would need to cut concerns about growth and the fact that the fed would need to cut you saw a sharp move in the two-year interest rate and the bond curve in general that created a very direct knock on consequence on the yen i won't go into all the details but the linkage is bond market the us bond market drives the yen and not the opposite way and so therefore what happened was the yen rallied the ton in response to the us bond market action and then as a function of that the nik then fell because most of those companies have you know vast amounts of foreign earnings which are when priced in yen when the yen rallies they underperform almost mechanistically as a function of that because they're foreign earners become less valuable and so that's the knock on effect not the other way around the yen carry trade like in terms of orders of magnitud just think about this way the amount of losses on yen carry positions were probably i don't know 10 billion during that period and the total losses in the us in the global equity markets were 6.5 trillion like the orders of people were saying that it was the yen carry trade driving the rest of the market action like the orders of magnitude aren't even in the ballpark it's a it's a silly way it's a it's it's uh in typically indicative of someone who doesn't actually truly understand the inner market action of the way uh the global financial markets work when they say it's the end carry trade instead of saying it started it germinated in the us and then knocked out knocked had knock on consequences elsewhere
Unlimited Macroeconomic Webinar August 2024,2024-08-23 12:15:03+00:00,46,WckqeUAfRNE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WckqeUAfRNE,[music] our august 2024 monthly macro webinar originally titled volatility is back uh right before uh volatility seemed to have compressed here um i i wanted to really i what i wanted to do in this conversation um is is really focus this month on what's priced in and i and i think you know it's so easy to get caught up in the intricacies of uh exactly what's happening uh with the day-to-day market action and the incremental uh price moves that you see and i think it can often be easy to lose track of where the current price levels are and what they're implying in terms of a ford picture of what's likely to transpire and so uh and whenever you're trading markets whenever you trade markets what you're trading is not uh is is relative to the consensus expectations that are built into that market pricing and so in order to generate alpha you have to have a divergent view relative to the consensus expectations so uh in order to understand how to whether or not you're divergent from the consensus expectations you have to understand what those are and so what's priced in is often you know the easy part of trading markets but it's so often overlooked particularly in times of market volatility and so let's start with what is priced in to the us markets uh this first chart gives you a picture of what's going on with short rate pricing and basically we've over the course of the last couple of weeks we've had a relatively significant shift in short rate pricing in terms of what's priced in uh for cuts uh and this updated as of a little bit ago what we see now is over the next year somewhere between 175 and 200 basis points of cuts that are currently priced into the market including uh three and a half cuts give or take priced in for the rest of 2024 that's really important to understand uh because what that does is it sets the foundation for the bond market and for all asset prices in terms of what's likely to to happen and when we look at this sort of pricing um it's been relatively acute shift in terms of the pricing you know it wasn't that long ago just the beginning of uh in in the in the early part of july where we had twos us twos uh at about 450 and they moved all the way down to well below four then popping up in the last couple of days and that magnitude of shifts has now been priced in a way where essentially there's a lot of cuts being priced in really over the course of the next six months by the fed almost 150 basis points priced in the next six months and then the following 6 months uh 50 more basis points give or take that's a very interesting pricing structure because what it implies is essentially a very rapid economic deterioration typically the fed only cuts at this pace of uh of of rates that are priced in when we have a relatively severe economic downturn and so that's what you see in these charts here which is we're giving some perspective on historically how much you know what has been the 12-month change in fed funds what has been the six-month change in fed funds and those lines that you're seeing are essentially what's priced in at this point and what you see is that um essentially the type of monetary policy that's being uh easing that's being priced in those were the things that happened uh that pace of things happened particularly if you look at that six-month chart in theid middle of covid in the middle of the financial crisis in the middle of the tech bust and in the 90 downturn so in the depths of those recessionary periods you saw cuts over a six-month time frame in line with what's currently priced in and over a 12 month time frame uh the cuts were a touch bigger uh in the uh covid period and and in uh 2008 and 2000 but not wildly far off with what's priced so essentially what that highlights is it highlights that short rate pricing right now is pricing in essentially uh a recession an acute recession type dynamic uh into the short rate market uh and in addition uh on top of that what we're seeing is that the yield curve while it has steepened to some extent through this period relative to uh recession periods it's actually not all that steep and so we still have a story where essentially depending on how you exactly you want to think about it we basically have a still close to zero term premium priced in uh to the long end of the bond market so very very quick cuts priced in uh akin to a recession no risk premium priced into bonds and that's basically what's what's going on in in the bond market now let's turn our attention to stocks uh and priced into stocks on the left- hand side what you see is the pe ratios uh this is these numbers are through the end of uh july uh and since we've done a nice roundt trip here so far in august they're largely representative what you see here in terms of pees is we're basically we're not at quite the levels on forward pees that we were in the tech bubble um but we're pretty darn close uh and it would only take something like uh 10% for the rally in stocks to get us to pe 12mon for pe levels that are on par with what we saw during that period of course we also saw relatively elevated pe levels coming out of covid that was a bit of a different circumstance because it was a post recession environment um and interest rates were close to zero at that same time so probably the most relevant corollary is where we were in the bust a tech bubble and bust and the pricing looks consistent with what we saw in the tech bubble now many people will argue that um that the earnings picture today for companies is quite a bit better uh than where we were in the tech bubble you know tech bubble pets.com etc uh the whole sort of uh story of that that period was that you know there was a lot of investment and there wasn't a lot of earnings that came with that investment um and it's true earnings are much stronger today than they were back in the tech bust uh bubble and bust but what we're paying for those earnings is not that much different and so while it's true there are more earnings we're also paying a lot more for those earnings you know we're paying as much for those for the same dollar of earnings today as we did back in the tech bump um in addition these uh this perspective is on 12month forward earnings now let me emphasize forward earnings are not actual earnings forward earning earnings are expectations of earnings and so when we look at what the expectations of earnings growth are over the course of the next 12 to 18 months what we see is earnings are expected to grow in uh mid to high double digigit range uh with sales growth priced or expected to grow right around 5% not that far off from what you see a nominal gdp and instead what we're expecting to see is margin growth uh to expand considerably over that same time frame something like uh 10% of the the earnings growth to come from margin expansion and you can see uh on the left on the right hand side what that pricing looks like what that expected um growth rate looks like relative to past earnings growth periods where mostly you've only seen earnings growth that is as strong as what's currently priced in in periods where you've had a significant uh rebound basically from a recessionary period it's very unusual to see earnings growth of this magnitude in a late cycle environment uh and this gives you some perspective in terms of uh the different pieces uh there on the left hand side what you see is the expectations of margin growth uh over the course of the next uh the next year um and into 2025 and what you see there is the expectation uh that you're going to get um you know you're going to get in total 15% earnings growth uh through 20125 relative to 2024 but you're only going to get nominal gdp or you're only going to get sales growth around 5% although that's ticked up a little bit um and if that's the case then you know the difference between those two has to come through margins and that's a relatively substantial expansion in margins expected and then from a risk premium pers perspective what you're seeing in equities a lot of different ways to think about equity risk premiums but the way i'd uh emphasize uh equity risk premiums today is look pees uh are quite elevated relative to what we've seen over the last 15 years so to are interest rates meaningfully more elevated relative to what we've seen over the last uh 15 years or so in the post gfc period the result is that the risk premium that you're earning on holding equities relative to bonds has compressed considerably this is just one way to think about uh equity risk premiums yard deni does this i think it's a you know it's a reasonable cut through that you can get some longer term perspective on and what you see here is we haven't been at this level of compressed risk premiums in stocks since the tech bust period so a considerably uh compressed risk premium on equities you have very high pees very high earning earnings growth expectations uh compressed risk premiums and so really what you're seeing is uh that analysts and investors are pricing out relatively you know quite strong equity outcomes and i think uh a big part of that is basically from a thematic perspective comes down to three basic themes that have driven a lot of the strength in stocks uh over the course of the last really like 18 months or so uh the first is and probably the biggest is pricing in an ai boom uh and that ai boom i'll go into in a little bit more detail in a minute um is uh is really a combination not just of increased uh spending on infrastructure related to ai plus productivity gains related to ai but in particular pricing in significant margin expansion uh in addition to the line improvements that would come from ai notably what we've seen over the course of this earnings period is that while earnings growth uh for for uh ai related companies you know has not been too bad uh and the surprise is if anything have tilted a bit positive other than uh uh tesla's outcomes um for the quarter specifically those stocks have generally done quite poorly and i think what that emphasizes is like look you could focus on any one quarter's earnings earnings always you know basically surprise to the upside because they get reset down the real question for these stocks is not what is earnings this quarter the real question is what does the outlook look like over the course of the next 24 36 48 months and i think what you're seeing here in terms of the equity response uh for a number of these ai names through this earnings period is a reflection of the fact that the indications are there's real questions about whether air related activities are going to deliver the type of earnings growth that are being meaningfully priced in to these stocks plus the rest of the market which we'll talk about the second thematic uh story that has been was an important driver of equities pushing to highs really in july through mid july uh was the expectation of a corporate friendly administration being elected um those expectations uh peaked in mid july uh and have fall en considerably since uh whereas you know uh with the switch of the candidacy and the democratic side uh we've seen a significant increase in the probability of a democratic administration being elected relative to a republican one and so we've had a big shift here that was a very important driver really post uh the debate up until uh up until the middle of the month middle of july that was supporting stocks that's faded to some extent um and finally what we have seen as a a final support to stocks is really this pricing in and of aggressive fed easing cycle um where uh where what people are expecting is that the fed is going to deliver meaningfully easy monetary policy all those cuts that's going to have both a valuation effect as bond yields fall the valuations of stocks typically rise just from a discount effect but it's also expected to stem any economic slowing and so you see this combination of themes all of which were very important in terms of being supportive to stocks and all of which from a fundamental perspective are starting to uh roll over a bit uh in terms of what they're showing uh except for i guess you could say the the fed easing cycle although in the last little bit you've seen that move in the opposite direction i think the ai related spending uh and and essentially what is priced in what is priced in to the market related to ai i think is one of the most important questions uh that an equity investor should be thinking through as they're buying the market not just the ai names which i talked about but how is ai expected to influence the totality of the market now this is a case where um i think it's important from a analysis perspective that instead of uh having a strong view in one direction or another it's important to start with an understanding of what's priced in and then think about the plausibility of that dynamic happening and so what i've done with this work here is i basically said look take as a given the expectations uh that are being talked about related to ai when it comes to uh the the next say eight years um from the techno optimus just take it take it it for granted that this is what is actually going to transpire how much would that path forward support equities relative to say where they were priced i don't know post svb right as i think is a good benchmark because that's really where you know the ai story started to get meaningfully influencing the equity markets and so on the left- hand side what you see uh this is from bloomberg is basically a view of what the expected investment uh related to ai will be over time uh until it starts to sort of level out as a share of total tech related infrastructure and so you see moving from uh you know the last year which was uh if you can see it was basically six $65 billion with expectations that by 2032 it would rise to $1.4 trillion so that investment let's just assume that that is entirely earned that those sales related to that investment is entirely earned by uh s&p 500 uh companies let's also assume that there's a massive boom in labor productivity related to ai um and here in the middle chart what we show is uh jp morgan has penciled out what the possible path of ai uh of improvement in productivity could be from ai uh basically penciling out something that is uh about uh twice as fast as the impact of the personal computer uh and about 50% larger so let's call that 2% in terms of a productivity benefit uh on an annualized basis well what does that get you if you put that together what does that get you in terms of increased revenue growth right revenue growth from the investment revenue growth from the increased productivity and what you see here is basically what you get is you know let's say the baseline us nominal gdp growth is about 4% nominal you add in that ai spend of 1.5 trillion uh by 2032 you get you know you add about 70 basis points of revenue growth uh and then you add in that 2% productivity growth uh and you you get something that's in the ballpark of just over 5% uh you know uh or just over 6% i'm sorry uh total uh earnings growth uh in the future so you know what does that mean well that is um you know transitioning from uh uh let's say something like uh 4% earnings growth to something like six to six and a half percent earnings growth you know that certainly would be beneficial uh to stocks but you're not talking about something over the course of the next eight years uh that would be a huge influence on stocks that's something you know on the order of hundreds of uh billions of dollars hundreds of billions of dollars in incremental earnings by 2032 so what would you pay for h if you knew that there were hundreds of billions of dollars of incremental earnings let's say $500 billion dollar of incremental earnings that would come by 2032 what would you pay for that even if you paid 20 times today you know you're not talking about uh relative to a a us uh market cap that's something like $50 trillion you're really not talking about a huge influence on stock prices certainly a benefit but not a huge influence so this on the surface this is not enough to get you to the point where you're talking about stocks you know nearly doubling as a function of the ai story so how do you get to stocks nearly doubling of an ai story it has to come through margins and i think that's the important thing to recognize is many techno optimists will talk about how the ai revolution will create you know earnings growth that will persist in the double digits uh to the mid double digits the the most extreme techno optimists will talk in those terms if you uh pencil that out in order to get mid even low mid double even low double digit returns uh growth rates in terms of earnings what you would have to do is get something like a 1% margin increase each year i want to emphasize each year you'd have to get a 1% margin increase and so what would that mean well if you take a look at what that would look like historically what it would it would do it would be to transfer the uh created a transition where corporate margins move from where they are right now which is about 12 or 13% up to 21% over the course of the next eight years representing the single greatest boom in corporate margins that has ever existed that is what is necessary and and by a m right to to multiples of where they've been on a long-term basis now could that happen certainly could happen one of the challenges with margin expansion and particularly margin expansion when it leads to a reduction in costs particularly labor costs is who is going to pay for the goods and services that are resultant right so many companies will talk about hey look i was able to fire you know 90% of my my workforce in a particular area in order you know leveraging a that that would that's a sort of a typical corporate story um the thing that doesn't get and then that sort of gets extrapolated well hey look we can just you know essentially gain all of that in terms of reduced headcount and maintain our topline revenue but one of the most important things that anyone who lived through the tech boom learned was that one person's income is their spending and if you lay off a bunch of people you're not going to get spending to continue at the same rate unless someone else disav and so that's the basic question is if you're going to get the sort of earnings growth that is essentially priced in and this this priced in earnings growth you know would be enough to basically double the s&p 500 from where we were in the in the post svv period if you put 20 times earnings on it in order to get this kind of uh earnings growth and this kind of sales growth some other sector some sector of the economy has to then change their savings rate to tove in order in exact offset of the margin increase that you see in the corporate sector and that is going to be very hard because which uh you know corporations in general represent roughly all the gdp in the economy give or take and so the question is okay which sector of the economy is going to tove at a rate of 8% of gdp a year could we have a fiscal deficit that expands by 8% of gdp it could happen but that would be relatively extreme do we have households that are at their lowest savings rate in decades would they dip in and uh meaningfully decrease their savings rate that's possible but the story the overall story which is very important to recognize is that in order to get these outcomes in order to get these outcomes what we have to have is we have to have a level of dissaving by some sector that creates the profit the the the flip side profitability for the corporations to represent the type of earnings growth that's being expected did in these uh in the current uh in the current pricing of the ai boom in the stock market and that right there that is a very very challenging story to play out so if you just take your baseline right and you say the you know our baseline earnings over the course of uh of the next like eight years eight years from now would be something like a little less than $3 trillion do of earning ings that would come from the s&p 500 add in that baseline you know add in that ai investment add in that productivity growth enhancement 2% productivity growth very very high over an eight-year period uh you get something like you know 5600 billion dollars of incremental earnings in order to get uh the type of earnings that are expected you have to add another say2 and a half trillion dollars of earnings on an annual basis that's what's necessary and that's what you need need to have that's where you need to get the sort of uh extreme margin expansion so and that's what's priced into the market right is essentially what we've seen price into the market over the course of the last uh 12 to 18 months uh as stocks have uh risen considerably is you know you can think about it something like2 and a half trillion dollars of forward earnings uh priced in uh 20 years or eight years from now at say 20 times uh 20 20 times pe and you get something like you know a doubling of stocks and that's not far off of what we've experienced right so uh i i think that's you know that's a pretty extreme pricing that you're seeing in the market related to the ai boom particularly in the context of you know recent earnings reports where a lot of these companies are looking at this and saying hey look are we really getting the type of profitability that's being talked about in this area now coming back to the sort of cyclical picture you know i should say that gives you the basic picture what's priced into the asset markets and stocks and bonds is a relatively extreme cutting cycle commensurate or consistent with a acute recession that's what's priced into the bond market what's priced into the stock market is the greatest technology boom uh of the last you know 100 plus years uh probably twice as big as the great greatest technology boom of the last um 100 years uh and you know those things are pretty inconsistent with each other in the sense of you know one is pricing essentially a 100% chance of immediate recession and the other is pricing stocks are pricing in essentially 0% chance of immediate recession and a boom uh and that's really an interesting story because if you look at what's actually going on neither thing has happened and and and what's happening instead is we're experiencing what is kind of like a very normal late cycle environment where you know growth is very modestly softening and that's what you see here you know real nominal growth is moderating a little bit real growth uh is moderating a little bit we're seeing areas of the economy that are softening um but nowhere near the boom the growth boom that's expected on the stock side and nowhere near the immediate recession that we're seeing on the bond side um timely measures of growth uh don't show anything like the type of acute slowdown that was feared i guess seven days ago or something like that um particularly coming out of the employment report and here's just two measures of timely uh growth rates which on the leftand side it's a weekly growth measure leveraging you know 10 different uh measures and and you see you know honestly not much is going on it's kind of been bumping around uh you know 2% give or take and on the right hand side you see the atlanta fed gdp now measure which is early in the quarter uh so you don't want to take it so literally but certainly none of the information that we've seen uh would suggest that we're seeing an acute slowdown including today's information about retail sales which you know was pretty strong all things considered so in a lot of ways it's a it's a goldilocks uh uh growth rate in the sense of it's not too hot and it's not too cold uh but it's imperfect for both stocks and bonds um there's been a lot of talk about what's going on in the labor market and i i figured i would just take a moment to dive into that a little bit uh when you take a look at what's going on in the labor market we have had a meaning you know a meaningful move up in the reported unemployment rate i i think it's important to recognize under the hood what's been driving that particularly over the last couple of months um overall uh if you look at the last 12 months uh the unemployment rate has risen by about 0.7% what's been driving that uh about about half of that give or take a little more than half of that has been driven by what i describe as either transitory uh employment related issues which is you know those employees on temporary layoff uh or driven by uh positive dynamics in the labor market which is getting new entrance into the market and new entrance naturally don't immediately get higher they often are unemployed initially as they enter the market and then eventually get employed uh what you see there is 24 basis points in terms of re-entrance and new entrance uh plus 20 basis points of temporary layoffs you add those two things together you know you've got something like you know 44 of the 71 basis points of unemployment rate rise which are you know not necessarily a a bad or likely to be sustainable over time rise um and so more likely with going on here we see is that the unemployment the labor markets are uh very slowly loosening in a pretty positive way in a way that's mostly driven by supply which is what you see over here on the right hand side which is if we just look at prim age workers which is really where the majority of income is earned and the majority of spending comes from what you see is that employment of prime age workers that's the red line is at multi-decade highs and what we see is labor force participation of prim age workers is also at multi-decade highs um and for those of you who are around back in the 2000 cycle you know the the the labor market in the 2000 period was extremely tight uh very very very hard to find workers and and we're not quite at that level right now uh but we're certainly nothing here looks like a recessionary environment with labor force and employment at these levels and so i look at this whole picture and i'd say it's it's basically consistent with the real gdp numbers and the nominal gdp numbers which is we've had a little bit of softening uh consistent with you know getting later in the cycle but nothing like an acute slowdown that's being expected in the bond market and nothing quite like the boom that's being expected over there in the stock market uh a lot of folks uh have been you know when when we had that acute move uh last week a lot of folks pointed to that move and said look that combined with the unemployment uh report suggests that we should have really uh we should have emergency cuts and i want to be clear that there at the time i thought there was no way uh there were going to be emergency cuts um and you know there continues to be no reason for such behavior emergency cuts happen when there is an acute credit deterioration uh or financial stability deterioration and uh what you see there on the right hand side uh you know is a bit tongue and- cheek around uh people calling for the fed put to come into the money uh when you saw that little wiggle up whereas the actual fed put came into the money i' argue appropriately during covid when there were serious concerns about credit risk the economy and the financial markets if anything actually financial stability particularly financial stability that the fed focuses on which is what's going on with the commercial banks has shown signs of normalization over the course of the last year in the post svb period while there was a lot of concerns in uh coming out of svb that the banking system would create would experience a significant deposit flight loan losses or deleveraging we really haven't seen that and if anything the most recent slo which came out during the market volatility last week really point to the fact that we've had now essentially a normalization of what's going on in the banking system uh relative to history and so that's basically what we're seeing here the fed is not going to look at either of these measures and be and have meaningful concern about financial stability uh so that's about the growth picture if we talk about the inflation picture um i i think the basic question continues to be will inflation come durably back to 2% now we've had a couple of good months of inflation data and i think that's a very you know that that that's been a positive uh in terms of giving some signs that we might be moving in that direction ction uh but the question is is that going to be sustainable um and you know i'd say the jury is still out about whether that will be sustainable odds are more likely than not that we're going to at least be in this two to 3% range which is better than the picture that we were seeing earlier in the year but still is uncertain about whether or not um will actually sustainably be there and so a lot of the calls for 50 basis point cuts uh and and um and and a lot of the pricing that exists in the in the short rate market related to the fall and inflation was really focused driven by this really acute what you see here in the middle acute slowdown in the uh inflation rate for these various super core elements uh as well as an acute slowdown of what happened in rent of primary residents and oar uh and interestingly enough you know those measures in part bounced back uh over the course uh you know in in the most recent report and when you take a step back and just basically scan um what's going on with inflation various inflation surveys of households of businesses of landlords basically say hey look does it look like there is a widespread collapse in price growth in the economy as would be indicated by these measures the answer is very clear that there is no signs of widespread collapse in price growth in the economy businesses aren't seeing it consumers aren't seeing it landlords aren't seeing it if anything you see some indications across all those that uh price growth might be a touch higher than where we were uh last summer and so the fed is appropriately cautious when they look at this measured inflation data and they say maybe we shouldn't be so confident to peg the last three months and say well the last three months are the way that they are um and and extrapolate that out into the future particularly when you see the sort of dynamics that we saw in the reporting that we saw in the report that we saw yesterday which is a lot of the things that were super disinflationary actually bounced back in the recent period uh and and so really calls into the question is this really going to be sustainable or not part of the reason why the fed waited till se till september is because they're going to take in another inflation report a pce uh inflation report as well as an unemployment report between today and then and they'll make the call appropriately then i think the the last uh the last couple of uh uh the last c 10 days basically 10 train days have been quite a world whirlwind and i and i just wanted to to emphasize when you look at these sorts of volatility shocks you know we had we basically had very very low volatility for an extented period of time and and naturally when you have this low volatil when you have a low volatility environment um a lot of financial entities will lever up in order to both take advantage of that low volatility environment but also as part of almost a mechanical uh var targeting type uh set of work that they're doing and a big part of the low volatility environment particularly the low price in volatility environment was related to fall selling by a variety of agents in the market that very very acutely switched you know back 10 days ago and and typically when you see these sorts of v spikes they typically are followed by a period of deleveraging amongst financial actors what's notable about this period relative to those previous periods is that we have reverse of all spike faster uh than has ever existed in the last you know almost 40 years of uh volatility behavior um in part that's driven by the fact that the all sellers are highly incentivized to keep selling in order and and as a result keep volatility price volatility low it's also a reflection of you know on the margin incrementally good uh data that was sort of uh a bit more sanguin than what was concerned about than the concerns that existed before what i'd say about these is that these sorts of fall spikes it's still the jury is still out about whether there's going to be a broader deleveraging that plays out so if you look back um even in 2018 um you saw periods uh you know weaker asset prices on a forward looking basis we haven't seen that yet but it doesn't necessarily mean that it won't persist as the leveraging type dynamics and reassessments of risk do take time to be fully reflected in the holdings of financial asset holders particularly leverage financial asset holders so it may play out in the future um but regardless of whether it does or does not i think that magnitude of volatility spike during that period what it really highlights is the fragility of a late cycle environment where you know to be frank the unemployment report that we saw uh in the friday before that fall spike was certainly not an unusual uh set of information um and it created a heck of a repricing of expectations of fed policy the us bond yield stocks etc and so and that was really that was really the impetus which i'll talk about in a minute that was really the impetus that created the knockon effects when you see those sorts of market action dynamics if you've been around this business long enough you look at that and you say man that shows a lot of sort of fragility under the hood and actually if for regular viewers of this macro webinar if you go back a month ago i was highlighting how you know you can just sort of see in the market action that there was a bit of a liquidity tightening that was going going on and you could see it in a very variety of different places in the market and then you know got a you not huge shock but a modest shop and it created that sort of gapping in terms of risk assessment uh and and acute deleveraging among amongst financial entities and so i think if not this instance what it highlights is that uh the market is certainly vulnerable to shifts in expectations uh and doesn't necessarily have the sort of liquidity uh and robustness that you might have expected you know 6 12 18 months ago just to finish up that topic you know a lot of folks have talked about the yen carry trade being the primary driver of what was going on in particular because you saw significant market action in japan on that monday um the end carry trade just for perspective um uh uh broadly across the financial system and particularly amongst leverage entities currency trading and leverage currency trading has become uh a meaningfully reduced part of uh uh of investors uh positions and and managers positions and in fact you know what really kicked this off had nothing to do with the yen what kicked this off was a soft cpi report which created an acute rotation from high growth stocks to russell 2k stocks particularly from equity market neutral managers that were holding that diff position and got caught in a short squeeze that had nothing to do with the year similarly as we got incremental information uh particularly sign indicating ease your monetary policy in the us that created on that friday a uh significant repricing of us monetary policy and a down move in the bond yield the fact that we then saw the market action in japan was more a function of the fact that the yen is trading off of us bond yields than it was something idiosyncratic to japan so what you see here is that the us twoyear starts to move down and then the yen moves down that's what you see here on the left hand side the two-year moves down which causes the yen to move down and the reason why japanese stocks fell was because you had a massive rally in the yen which created uh meaningful repricing of japanese stocks which are mostly global in nature and mostly earning um earning uh earning offshore revenue and earnings and so therefore they're particularly sensitive to the yen moves because it has a translation effect to the price of their uh of their stock in yen terms and so when you saw that move in yen that you see here um that then created the hit to japanese stock price and in particular in a liquid market particularly early early on monday morning that created that knock on effect and so uh the story was not the yen rallied and then you saw all this other market action it's not what happened what happened was us bonds rallied the yen rallied japanese stocks fell they fell significantly in an illiquid market which then created a broader repricing of risk which created a reinforcing dynamic in the us going on is a repricing of us assets and us growth expectations driving the rest of the asset markets the last thing i'll end on here before i get into the questions um which has kind of you know kind of been simmering in the background hasn't really been talked about that much because we've had some of these other dynamics happening in the us and in japan is uh is the significant weakness in china um and i think this is very interesting we've seen um a couple of new data points come out that really highlight um the fact that that china is in a deflationary depression and and i use depression not because growth is falling off a cliff the point of depression the word depression is not um about a growth rate the word depression is about uh macroeconomic uh dynamic and what that dynamic is is that shifts in a typical recession let's recession from depression in a recession you have a slowing of borrowing uh as interest rates are elevated and then as interest rates fall borrowing recovers which creates recovery in the economy in a depression essentially the decline the over indebted sectors that had been borrowing are unresponsive to a decline in interest rates and therefore despite the fact that interest rates fall they don't pick up their borrowing which creates an improvement in the economy that's exactly what we're seeing in china is the over levered household and and corporate sectors are not borrowing despite the fact that interest rates have fallen considerably in the market uh and so that depression environment the way that that gets resolved is through a decline in the currency you know get gets resolved basically through a massive easing right just think about how did the us and other developed economies get get uh their economies resolved during the global financial crisis it was a massive easing right both fiscal and monetary and so far chinese policy makers have chosen not to engage in that massive policy easing that meaningful policy easing uh necessary to break the depression cycle that's going on there and we've gotten a couple of extra data points which i think are interesting particularly around the currency pressures that exist uh in china and so what you see there on the le hand side is basically despite the fact that there is an incredible trade balance that china is uh experiencing what we see is that fdi flows and other capital flows are flowing out of china about as much as they possibly can creating a very fragile currency and i think the stress period recently is very interesting that despite the yen's move so significantly higher all china could do was basically move the currency back to the middle of its pricing band instead of actually taking it as an opportunity uh to move that band higher reflecting the very weak structural conditions there in fact things are so bad in china that they've decided to b basically stop reporting the information for instance uh the capital flows uh into the japanese or into the ch the chinese stock and bond markets are so negative that they've just stopped reporting the stock connect flows lest anyone have any idea how weak they are at its core there was a possibility in china um uh that the um that the third plenum which is an every roughly fiveyear meeting that sets out the strategic vision of how the chinese economy is going to be managed that we could see could have seen indications of a big bang of response to this deleveraging or depression dynamic in fact we saw exactly the opposite uh communications and inspiration that were much more aligned with uh what is this living a frugal life uh and fiscal restraint which are exactly the wrong things that are needed given the chinese dynamics
Higher Rates and Re-shoring,2024-08-22 12:15:02+00:00,6,GtFMHqvhBmc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtFMHqvhBmc,"so you have this reshoring going on you have cheap natural gas everywhere so you can kind of rebuild the whole industrial area of the us like there are a whole number of things that could create a lot of growth in the us that are going to push this inflation maybe beyond what everyone's expecting and can you help me kind of work through that the first part being you know is this debt to gdp how does that impact things when you have rising rates and then this reshoring that's occurring i mean i don't know to me it seems like inflation could be substantially higher on the on the higher rates and higher debt environment i i think it's important to um it's important to get down to the to the cash flows you know who's paying what yeah um as a function of those higher rates and so if you think about businesses and households their interest expense hasn't meaningfully increased because mostly what they did is lock in low fixed term loans for a long time or or issued long-term bonds and so um a higher interest rate environment will be corrosive to their cash flows over you know if it existed for five or 10 or 20 years from from now as you have to refinance like even homeowners you know people move they die they get married they get divorced whatever like you know there's children like people have to move and so eventually those mortgages will be reset but that's very very slow moving so if you just think about that for those borrowers there's not a lot going on in terms of the higher interest rate environment obviously for the government side uh the duration of government debt is quite a bit shorter obviously 25% is in floaters whatever t bills and you know a fair amount of the debt stock is getting repriced um on an annual basis that debt service has risen and um and the question is who earns that debt service who gets that debt service a fair amount of that debt service goes either to non gdp oriented savers so like a pension fund or it's going to rich people um uh and to a lesser extent it's going to to corporations but mostly what's happening is it's going to you know if a pension fund gets 5% more income what do they do they go buy some financial assets that's for sure but they don't create gdp if a household a rich household gets that income remember it's the last dollar in right and so im matt what does the spending profile look like for let's just say a homeowner or you know a household who has a million dollars of income what's that dollar of you know a million dollar to a million1 right their propensity spend that dollar is essentially zero which is quite a bit different from you know traditional income growth let's say if you added the extra dollar to the median income you know at $50,000 it would be very different and so the the the gdp impact of the higher debt service or the higher debt payments particularly from the government is is relatively dominous um uh and and and really the the story is much more about the fact that like you know most households yeah you know 96% of households are earning are employed and they're earning income and that income is going up 5% a year like that's that's a you know that's pretty good in terms when it comes to spending i think the sort of longer term dynamic which you point out related to the reshoring story i think is really important um in the sense that like we went through you know most of us all all we've known up until covid was like 40 years of disinflation globalization peace all three of those very important right in driving this lwi inflation environment and if you just sort of think about you know globalization rolling back and peace maybe not being as uh you know a conflict not being as low as it has been over the course of the last 40 years those things are very infl now you know onshoring is good for growth good for us growth and bad for inflation right from the perspective of like what we did for 40 years is find the lowest cost producer in the world and have them produce it rather than have you know it produced domestically this is a trade out there there's lots of there's lot there's many reasons why you might want to resore supply chains both you know economically as a business to create duplicate supply chains or durability in your supply chains there's also you know geopol itical reasons why you might want to onshore your production it's just a trade-off though it's good for growth and it's bad for inflation that's all there is to it and so i think part of that story is you know we've sort of all as investors and savers have looked at the world in this disinflationary growth strong growth lens over the course of the last 30 40 years built portfolios that benefit from that particularly like 6040 but if we're instead going to maybe inflationary growth or inflationary weak growth the portfolios that you want to have as a saver long-term saver are pretty different in those environments than what we've seen in the last 30 or 40 years"
Why Has Stimulated the Persistent Inflation ?,2024-08-21 12:15:04+00:00,4,p2nWagwcMCk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2nWagwcMCk,what are you seeing today across the inflation front i know you've got some recent tweets that you've been working on and putting out there and and and us growth versus reshoring versus interest rates versus inflation versus the us economy versus the global economy there's a lot of you know interrelated pieces of the puzzle there maybe you can walk us through some of your thoughts right now on how that's going to uh kind of move through the system and your new product is going to have sort of a regime dependent type of strategy structure to it so i'm thinking if you can walk us through the narrative on the global macro side then maybe we can move into how that manifests in investments and what you might think about for the for the viewers and listeners and how you're thinking through that in your uh in your hedge products yeah i i think from a from a a broad macro perspective um in a lot of ways we're seeing uh sort of very traditional late cycle style environment and um and that is uh that's an unusual environment for for because basically none of us have seen it in our professional lives or in our lives i have but i'm old um uh you know it's one where as we talked about sort of that restructuring of the economy and particularly the debt side of the economy has made credit growth just a much lower lower uh of much lower importance you know um borrowing by households and businesses today is at recession like levels if you look at recession lows over the course of the last 50 years were basically there there's not a lot of borrowing um and instead what we're seeing is predominantly uh an expansion over the course of the last two two and a half years that has been income driven and an income driven expansion you know you know in a lot of way is sort of like the the most classic expansions that exist uh in the world in the sense of you know if i earn a certain amount of income and i spend that income that becomes you know my spending become someone else's income and they take that income and they spend it right and that is a very sustainable dynamic because um unlike borrowing driven expansions there's no buildup of unsustainable uh conditions right if we just are all spending out of our income you know there's there's something going on right you know our balance sheets are the same uh and we get that gdp uh effect i think you know that that's sort of the underlying driver of this economy and that's quite a durable expansionary dynamic what's happened is that has led to a level of nominal spending that's too high relative to the productive capacity of the us economy led to inflation that's elevated relative to the fed's mandate obviously come down but still is elevated relative of the feds mandate and as is classic central bank tightened a lot in order to respond to that try and get the economy to slow down it's just that in an income driven expansion you know tightening is not particularly effective it's not to say it's not it's certainly not i i would uh it's hard to make a quantitatively driven case that it's stimulative i think there's some people who are confused who are sort of like a you know i don't understand this why this expansion is going on so i think it's stimulative it's not stimulative it's definitely contractionary it's just it's not that contractionary i mean just think about it if you're earning income you you know have a a 3% morgage locked in you own your car outright uh you know what what do interest rates have to do with anything interest rates could be 2% they could be 5% they could be 7% it like has no impact on your day-to-day life unless you're borrowing right right and so that's very persistent and so it's just taking a long time for the economy to slow down in the context of that durable income driven expansion
Is the 2024 U.S. Economy like the 2008 U.S. Economy?,2024-08-20 12:15:03+00:00,5,_XfGXzZhzZE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XfGXzZhzZE,bob what are you seeing today or are you seeing anything today that you know rhymes or you know potentially looks like some of the dislocations that you saw in ' 08 um are any of those dislocations as serious as they might have been in '08 what are you seeing in today's macroeconomic conditions and the potential for regime shift and obviously inf inflation has a spectre that is um hanging over the markets so anything there that you're seeing any corollaries or is this a little bit unique what's the same what's different well i think a lot of the dynamics that are going on right now that sort of surprised many market participants were the consequence of that gfc period and and in the um you know 15 years post gfc both in the moment and the 15 years post gfc you know i i had i was in the sort of lucky position to work with policy makers around the say the evolution of the regulatory frameworks um and and the incentives really in terms of how to restructure the economy and you know basically what happened over the 15 years post gfc up until covid was we totally restructured the the nature of debt in the us economy um it's it's hard to believe but back in 2007 50% of us mortgages were floaters um and you know average ltvs were between 90 and 100 at the time now both of those things are just non-existent today right essentially 100% are longer duration 100% of mortgages are longer duration fixed loans um and uh and ltvs you know except in sort of edge cases are um you know the 80 ltv loan is the benchmark loan that people take you know no negative am loans or anything like that that restruct ing the economy is the thing that had and i should say and also the banks have been totally restructured as well in the sense of um you know there were banks with 3% capital right 30x levered on a true equity basis at the time that doesn't exist anymore you know you need 10 to 15% capital to be running a bank these days so two huge parts of the overall system that have been totally restructured i think the thing that is so that's created a lot of reduced sensitivity to the economy you know to the to interest rates as a function of that um which i think is surprised a lot of people and i think the other thing uh that is very interesting particularly as it relates to the um the cr issue is i think a lot of people draw a direct distinction between the cr issue to cr issue today and the financial crisis but unless you're sort of in the bowels of how banks work you you wouldn't necessarily see the difference both are credit risks right there's going to be lots of losses on c no question about the question is not will there be losses just in the same where lot lots of losses on houses and house lunding back in the gfc the question is not will there be losses the question is when do those losses have to be recognized and there's been a total restructuring of banks to basically strip out any risky securities off their balance sheet so they don't have to be mark to market um and even you know even the efforts taken to let's say reduce the mark tomarket approach on on uh on bonds also have you know it's kind of the end of that series of steps and now we have e yeah there's going to be a few hundred billion dollars of losses and they're going to be eaten by banks but if it takes 15 years to recognize them like who cares you know so far banks have recognized you know have earned like a hundred billion dollars in nim on these loans and have recognized a billion dollars of losses or something you know i mean just like who cares right if it takes 15 years but that's really important so people particularly post svb i think missed they looked at c they said we're going to have a financial crisis dynamic to be clear the fed missed that the fed sat there and said we're going to have a cr driven financial crisis in the banks they missed it right they should know better but they missed it because they didn't understand folks didn't understand how the the risk exposures of banks had been totally restructured to significantly reduce the risk of a larger scale credit event through lever financial entities
Elections Are Risk Management Exercises,2024-08-19 12:15:03+00:00,6,ugCyYPXsM9k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCyYPXsM9k,i did want to ask you about the election from the perspective of like the economy and markets because you have a probabilistic framework which i really like about how you look at everything and i'm just wondering like do you think about things like elections in terms of how they might impact the market or do you kind of just discard them i don't know who's going to win you know i don't know what's going to happen like how do you think about that in your framework i think in general when you're thinking about particularly fiscal policies um and of course fiscal policies connect to elections right um uh because you know the elected officials are the ones implementing the fiscal policies um you want to you don't you don't have to necessarily meaningfully speculate uh on this stuff to get ahead of it like you're much better off through time if you just look through time you're much better off like wait till they pass the legislation understand what the macroeconomic consequence of the legislation is pencil that out bet on those macroeconomic consequences like in general you're much better off doing that and you could get totally caught up uh and tie yourself into knots trying to bet on you know whether or not the political winds will blow this way or blow that way uh and the reason why that is is like um i sort of say like uh things that determine political outcomes are not the question is whether you have edge do you have edge in determining the political outcome i'll say this very bluntly i do not have edge in determining what the political outcome will be what's the likelihood that we'll have a new administration like i don't know whatever predict it says better you know it's as good as anything i could come up with right or you know various forecasts and models i mean maybe you don't want to focus on just one one forecaster model but like i'm just saying like there's probabilistic models am i better than a probabilistic model like no i'm not better than a probabilistic model that's not my area of expertise what i can understand is what are the likely policies that are going to be implemented by both paths right if the 60% that go this way or the 40% of would go that way uh given the probabilistic model and what are the macroeconomic consequences of that but even there what i'd say is there's still a lot of uncertainty like tell me what a new administration's set of policies are going to be like who the heck knows it depends on do they get elected do they have the house do they have the senate how much does it get watered down you you know like who knows right and so like you get lost in all of those things and the reality is like you're probably going to be fine just waiting to see when the legislation passes i mean or is very close to passing and then reflect the macroeconomic consequences of those policies as they come yeah that made me think about andy conston we talked to him about like the quarterly uh treasury funding announcement like he sees all these people like trying to predict the quarterly funding funding announcement he just waits until it comes out and then says all right what are the implications i already know what it is it seems like a similar type of framework yeah i i think i mean if anything um there is probably more clarity around the uh decision the primary decision rules that are related to that than there are to like fiscal policy in a whole like i'm like literally okay so new administration comes in like is the 10% tariffs on every on everyone is that rhetoric or is that policy is is a 60% tariff on china is that rhetoric is that policy will congress congress accept that will they not accept that like will they water it down will there be the constituency to do that what sort of you know uh exceptions are they going to make like all of those questions are super pertinent to understanding whether or not it will have a meaningful macroeconomic consequence and there and i'm going to be blunt about this no one has any answers to those questions because the answers to those questions will be determined by the electorate which no one has predictive ability to determine what they're going to do and number two in the head of the people who get elected which like who the heck know and so you know like what what are you doing if someone's gonna so you know it's a person who comes in and says i know for certain that there's going to be larger deficits po certain tariffs policy and this direction policy in that direction like they're totally overconfident right and so you're much better off putting yourself in a position to say look i don't really know what's going to exactly transpire particularly in a in a bi you know in a bodal highly uncertain outcome where the actual policy implementation isn't clear like put yourself in a position so that you're not overweight any particular outcome because you don't really know what particular outcome will happen and that you don't have any implicit or explicit vets on the politics or the policy and wait to see the politics and the policy as they come in so it's a risk management exercise politics in general particularly elections i should say are risk management exercises much more than they are uh opportunities for alpha
Post-GFC U.S.  Regulations Fundamentally Restructured Debt,2024-08-16 12:15:02+00:00,6,HhDnm9_8FnM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhDnm9_8FnM,so the idea with these deb driv cycles we were we were prone to these kind of blow up type situations where things eventually blew up is it the idea we're less likely to have that in an income driven cycle than we were in a debt driven cycle yeah that's exactly right i mean and this isn't this isn't um this isn't by chance like what happened was we had the gfc and basically everyone in the regulatory framework was like no more gfc type dynamics right we're going to totally restructure the the banks have been restructured have lots more capital you know it's hard it's hard to uh hard to remember but you know in 2006 50% of us mortgages were floaters you know today it's essentially zero right that's a that's a huge restructuring of the way in which debts are serviced in the economy you know 15 20 years ago lots of companies borrowed through cni or you know other loan arrangements they were borrowing on floaters today you know big companies basically term long-term fixed debt uh you know at low yields and so we went through this whole process of households businesses financial intermediaries we want to make sure that they are they are um they can withstand a rise in interest rates so we don't have another crisis type dynamic that we saw in 2008 which was you know a terrible outcome for you know millions of americans and we have been very very effective at doing that but the consequence of that means that uh the fed's power to slow the economy is much uh weaker today than it was back then and the likelihood that we get a cascading self-reinforcing negative dynamic is a lot lower today than it was back then and so you know it's not it's not a random outcome we sort of purposefully said let's restructure our economy to have it look a lot more like the ' 50s and the 60s than to look like uh you know the the preg gfc uh type economy and and and just one question on that is there is there any risk that the debt has moved from the public over to the the government side um and thinking where there might be like levels of debt that could be problematic i don't know what you're you know what you think about that with the level of sort of debt in this country i mean businesses are in good shape consumers are in pretty good shape but what about the like the us government us government's got a lot of debt and i think um the us government's indebtedness is and and um government's indebtedness is a little a little different in terms of how to think about it than uh private sector and the primary reason why that is is that um the central bank has the ability to essentially write off existing debt stock if the level of debt is too high or if the price that is required by the market to finance it is too high and so i don't think that like the current the current level of debt or even a higher level of debt is not that interesting like go look at japan japan has tons of debt right um and what did they do they just printed money and basically retired the debt right if uh and and you know they have the lowest interest rates in the developed world so it's not it's not like just because you have high debt you have an interest rate problem right the question is basically you know what is the uh appropriate level of interest rates for an economy given its macroeconomic conditions and what needs to happen for the central bank to respond to basically uh ease the debt burden that might exist and so in the us case um you know if you if you look at the overall picture uh if anything it it's probably that the current interest rate level is too low not too high right and so maybe the debt burdens you know are are we going to probably pay off all the debt you know dollar for dollar the way it's currently issued like probably not okay that's a that's a 20 or 30e time frame story like you know as a as a uh someone who thinks about in sort of a three to six month time frame like who cares like you know yep the us debt will not be paid back uh dollar for dollar where you're probably not going to get the same you know real return that you might uh expect as a function that you historically gotten okay so what um what does that mean today no if anything yields need to rise not fall today given the strength of the economy and so the path and this is i think people people like skip a few steps here like what needs to happen in order for uh the debt burdens to be unacceptable is first yields have to rise and yields and the yield curve have to be too steep relative to the underlying fundamental conditions and then the central bank will come in and will ease through the purchase of securities if necessary right first central bank will lower the short-term interest rate and then if the long-term interest rate doesn't uh doesn't play along the way it needs to then they'll buy the long-term bonds in order to bring the interest rate down but we're we're at the beginning of that path not at the end of that path so the way i describe it is there has to be a lot more pain in the bond market before we get the types of interventions that are that would align with the fact that um you know would align with you know the central bank basically paying buying out the existing debt stock and reducing the debt burden
Slow Moving Central Banks And Interest Rates,2024-08-15 12:15:08+00:00,6,shQ9wT8dTHo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQ9wT8dTHo,is this a flaw in the way the fed works like it seems like always in these cycles basically what you said happens which is things go really bad they cut a lot like is there any way they could i mean i guess that's the nature of the backward looking data and how long it takes to come through and stuff but is there any way they could operate in such a way that we ever would have like the like to slowly work the rates down and ease right in there type of cycle or is is this just kind of the nature of the way the game is well for any of these central banks um their uh slow moving nature uh and backward looking demeanor i i call it a feature and a bug uh it's a feature uh because it because what it means is if you understand the data that they look at uh and the way that they make their decision and how they balance things it's a feature because you can have a much better understanding of where they're likely to go if you can start to think about what's going to happen with the economy uh than they than they know so that's a feature the bug is that it means that policy is always delayed and and this is how it works with all these central banks two main reasons one they are consensus driven organizations that's a very important thing to think about uh which means that the action only comes when the last person decides that it makes sense to tooo right that's the nature of a consensus driven organization and two they're looking at the actual data they're not looking at you know they're in general not predicting what's going on they may make pred prediction but they're not changing their policy based on predictions right they're changing their policy based upon the actual data that they see if you go back and you know go read what what paul said in november and december about what was going to happen to the economy he was the one who was saying that there were going to be a bunch of cuts happening but who cares his predictions were irrelevant the only thing that mattered was what actually transpired with the actual data and the actual economy and that didn't align with cutting so they didn't cut right and so that really emphasizes the fact that it's the data that they make the decision on on a backward looking basis and it's consensus driven which means slow moving and so you add those two things up and like unless there's an acute crisis they just don't move that fast in any direction do you think i was listening to you on the unusual whales uh last one they did with with jim kon and and he was talking about the idea that he thinks they might not a lot but he might they might cut you know through the end of the year and he also thinks that might bring like a meaningful acceleration in inflation like not not 4% but something like much higher in the future like it would be a huge mistake to be cutting right now like what do you think about that idea like if they do cut now it could cause like a meaningful acceleration in inflation well i just nothing really moves that fast i think that's part of the um part of the lesson of the last couple of years is you know the real economy just is like not that sensitive to interest rates and so uh um should on a tightening side but also on an easing side right like they're not you know if the fed moves 2550 basis points in terms of uh a cutting cycle like what are the odds that it's going to you know who who is doing what in response to that that will meaningfully influence economic conditions um and i think the answer is like not you know there there isn't there aren't a lot of uh there aren't a lot of folks whose economic conditions are constrained by the by interest rate changes that are on the order of 25 or 50 basis points um and the reason why that is is um you know mostly what's happening most of what's driving economic conditions right now is inome and income growth that's basically basically what we see is households are earning a pretty good income 5 to 6% a year and they're spending five to 6% a year nominal and the savings rat's basically flat like that's that's basically what's happening and businesses are earning you know reasonable earnings and to the extent that they need to do capex they're financing it out of cash flow and mostly not borrowing and so an incremental move of interest rates in one direction or another isn't going to make a huge difference in any time frame that the fed cares about um to cause uh their change of behavior now if we entered a significant easing cycle we're talk about hundreds of basis points of easing then i think what we would experience is we'd unleash you know incremental borrowing that would supplement the already elevated nominal income growth and that incremental borrowing would mean that overall nominal spending would be elevated in comparison to the productive capacity of the economy we're already at you know the us is already at the productive capacity right i mean employment you can't find any more people right i mean we part of the reason why it's been able to continue to expand is because we we've had so much immigration if you just look at you know um employment as a percent of the you know prime working age population it's basically at alltime high so like there is no incremental supply that can that can come into the market and and meet higher nominal demand so i agree like significant a significant easing cycle might cause a reacceleration nominal spending and lead to inflation but you know anything that's in the range of anything that's plausible from the fed frankly won't do much whether they do something or don't do something
"Oil, Goods and Housing Inflation Status",2024-08-14 12:15:00+00:00,4,9Bz3VAU_24Y,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bz3VAU_24Y,do you believe like some do that the housing component is uh likely to fall or do you think it's going to remain elevated here um as we go throughout the rest of the year and into next year well um if you're looking at you know uh oil prices is a critical place to start and that's because oil affects all all prices uh particularly all goods uh and to some extent services prices those prices you know oil has remained elevated it looked like were getting a little bit of uh decline in oil but that's bounced back up and so you know the big disinflationary impulse that existed last year is not is not happening oil is basically flat then you turn to uh goods prices uh goods prices are now you know basically back to pre-co levels of inflation uh and a lot of those sort of big disinflationary impulses like things like used cars and uh things like that um the price level has come down to the point where we're now at levels that would be commensurate with the rise in nominal incomes so the odd that happened over the you know the postco period so the odds that we're going to get a lot more disinflationary impulse from those prices are not very good on a forward looking basis look month-to month who the heck knows what's going to happen i'm just saying like auto prices they're not going to fall another 25% used auto prices aren't going to fall another 25% uh because incomes are up a lot so you don't want to look at pre-co prices as your benchmark because incomes are up 25% on a nominal basis uh and so odds are those good prices are not going to fall nearly as much and then we turn to housing and and really housing it's all about um all tenant rents and when you look at which is very different a lot of people focus on new tenant rents that is misleading that's not what drives oar that's not what drives actual paid for rent what drives actual paid for rent is all tenant rents uh and the um the fed series which captures those suggests that we're still seeing inflation in the 5 to 6% range on an annualized basis of all rents in part because there's a big catch up to the rise of new new rents uh that existed in the postco period those surged at double digit levels at one point and if we're at that range we're going to see house price inflation that remains elevated uh compared to pre-co levels um and so you take services inflation which is elevated to preo levels house price uh housing or shelter costs that's elevated relative to pre- crisis level pre-co levels goods uh prices that are probably going to be a bit above where they were preco given um the disinflationary or the the de globalization dynamics that are occurring and oil prices that are flat at best and you add that all up and you know you know things are a little too high
Indexation and Relication vs Picking Managers,2024-08-13 12:15:03+00:00,3,jBXvtGv5nZY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBXvtGv5nZY,"there's always this question of let's say indexation versus picking um and you know everyone hopes to be able to pick which head fund managers are going to be the the right tail incredible performers etc and a lot of people think that they can pick um uh the reality is that if you look through time while the hedge fund industry as a whole their strategies generate a fair amount of alpha um particularly before you start charging the fees uh no individual manager individual manager individual managers in general do not have outperformance persistence that's any better than random selection like of course if you take 3,000 managers some managers will persist in being the top quartile or the top you know above median returns for an extended period of time but the frequency in which that occurs is no better than random chance and so while there's a lot of people who think that can pick which fund and they will spin up every story imaginable i'm telling you i've heard them all about why one manager is likely to be better than another the reality is they cannot pick because the information that they pick which is backward looking you know they used to pick which is mostly backward looking returns gives you no information value on whether they're likely to be an outperformer in the future and so that's i i think that's a tension and that's attenion that's you know like bogle 75 years ago was like dealing with the same problem it's like why not pick the 500 sacks that only go up it's like yeah but you can't you know um so indexation is is uh is a big part of it and then i think another question that's always the issue at hand is um replication versus direct investment so talking about replication replication is inevitably imperfect that's the way it works it's imperfect and there's a trade-off between the imperfection of that of that replication and you know the ability to get diversification so if you think about the you have to think about this as a trade-off imperfect replication but better diversified lower cost more tax efficient and ultimately what matters for investors is not you know how perfect your replication is um it's you know what is the return after you pay the fees after you pay the taxes what is that compounded return over time that's really what they care"
Creating An Asset Management Firm,2024-08-12 12:15:04+00:00,3,Yif38ltxNu4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yif38ltxNu4,whenever you think about building an asset manager um a startup asset manager is not an easy thing to do in the us regulatory context and um you know i i love coming on to these sorts of conver conversations and talking about what we're doing and talking about investment management and u what's happening in in markets but the reality is as a ceo of a startup financial firm uh particularly one that's a 40 act a regulated you know a sec registered product um a lot of the work in the day-to-day is related to you know regulatory work setting up the business the operations uh compliance uh you know along with all the sort of you know basics around starting up a business so um if you're moving fast and trying to build a great investment product and at the same time working in that regulatory framework and building a business from scratch those you know that's uh there's more than enough work to go around that's probably what i'd say right it's definitely a a costly endeavor too in the 40x space where you're putting all that together right all the different service providers you know the platform and the distribution component how you're going go to market all these different things adds layers of of cost to the equation sh we say right exactly exactly i mean i think you know relative to where where this uh where this world was uh five years ago there's been a heck of a an evolution on the existence uh and deepening of white label providers who at least from the operational side provide a significant amount of lift um has really helped startup managers like ourselves combined with some regulatory changes that occurred uh you know mostly during co that um allowed for a lot more flexibility in the 40x space um for new issuers uh so that's that's improved uh the pace and difficulty of getting to market um but that doesn't mean that you know it's it's uh it's certainly costly and it requires you have to you know when you when you build and launch these products particularly when you work with something like a white label provider you are um you know it's not just a casual vendor relationship you know the fate of your business is highly tied to their ability to operate effectively and so you have to think very carefully about who the right partner is um and and what the right relationship is that you want to have um and along the way you're thinking do you want buy or build buyer build buyer build and so um you know there's a lot of decisions along that whole path that you have to craft uh and decisions you have to live with you know for years to come once you make those decisions yeah
Global Exchange Markets in June 2024,2024-08-02 12:15:04+00:00,4,IaT8XK8dcQY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaT8XK8dcQY,what's going on in the global exchange rate markets which i think um from a macro investors perspective uh is always uh is always uh top of mind and i and i think um when you look at what's happening globally there is more you know we we basically have gone through the last five years have been a pretty correlated period in particularly across developed economies but really globally it's been pretty correlated um probably china being the main outlier and i i think increasingly what we're seeing in the fundamental conditions is divergences uh divergences that are functions of policy divergences and so in particular you know uh i think people sort of talk about us exceptionalism as if it you know it's uh it's is mana from above um rather than simply a function of different policy choices uh in terms of of how the economy is running and different structures and of the economy um but this idea that um you know the us economy continues to have higher levels of inflation you know stronger nominal growth rates which will likely lead to higher uh for longer monetary policy whereas uh other economies you know places you know europe in particular but also japan to some extent are are likely to have um you know easier monetary policy for an extended period of time given their both structural and cyclical dynamics is the sort of that will uh likely put pressure on the dollar to continue to be strong relative to the rest of the world and i think cuts really counter to there sort of this general theme that's out there in the market right now that that we're going to have uh like a us sovereign debt crisis or whatever at the time when the dollar basically hasn't been the strong in decades and and i think that uh divergence in policy and macroeconomic driven by macroeconomic conditions diverging from each other will contin to sort of emphasize the dollar relative to other developed exchange rates which um will surprise i suspect a lot of people over the course of the next uh couple years yeah i couldn't agree more actually historically in these types of periods you know what i what i do primarily is is trade volatility and look at volatility markets you know the volatility during that period in fx and gold which i by the way are i think more similar than gold is to oil even right um are are the assets that are the most um you know volatile during those periods and um represent the most opportunities too so uh it could couldn't be more historically that that definitely is in line people think that broadly all commodities are volatile during this period because i think about opec in the 70s and but the reality is oil was actually not very volatile it had a very you know clear upward trend and didn't have a ton of volatility um over over uh the 70s um and uh was under p pinned by by opec so kind of that that was like a fed put essentially on on oil which really reduced volatility so there are there are a lot of other assets that have been had volatility priced into them which are kind of false uh whereas fx and again gold are areas where i think calls in particular in gold and other types of hedges and in fx um uh are are wonderful opportunities um in the long
A Chaotic World and it's Impact on Macroeconomics,2024-08-01 12:15:05+00:00,3,wykgKhz_KGk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wykgKhz_KGk,if you look back the last three years it certainly would suggest that the world is moving into a much more chaotic state than what we've seen before then this could this could last for a very very long time and i and i kind of just wanted to circle back a little bit maybe to hear whether you have any thoughts on this but also to the point that you made earlier that the majority of investors are probably invested in the wrong way because that is not the environment that the 60 portfolio was created for right i i mean i think the the the key thing when i when i hear that sort of uh perspective or or or or speculation is to have humility about whether or not that is true i think what causes macro investors to get out over their skis is where they start to project uh the fact that they have understanding of how macroeconomic systems work to how political systems work two very different things a skill set in one does not connect to a skill set in the other uh and so as an investor it's very important to understand what your edge is and where and where that where that is and where that ends and for me in particular let's call it sort of uh geopolitical perspectives is not an area where you should listen to what i have to say because i don't have an edge in projecting what is likely to happen what i can say is from a macroeconomic perspective various geopolitical outcomes have various macroeconomic uh consequences let's say and that those consequences the question is do you want to be prepared uh for a wide variety of those different consequences given the uncertainty uh or do you want to be concentrated in a particular set of of of outcomes and that's where i'd say i'd emphasize like most people holding the 6040 portfolio have a huge bet on peace and globalization it's been the truth in the past but is not necessarily the norm in the future and so a a critical thing is to help to create a diversified portfolio that helps protect against less globalization and more global conflict is not an exercise in projecting that it might happen it's recognizing and having the humility to understand that you don't know what's going to happen and so it's much more important to be prepared for a lot of different outcomes than for any one particular out
AI in Systematic Investing,2024-07-30 12:15:02+00:00,5,GAej22mmNOI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAej22mmNOI,you know these things are just tools ai is just a tool there's lots of different tools ai is also so general like there are very specific tools that exist and there are concepts that you're trying to capture and the tools are just ways to capture the concepts and the tools get more powerful and the techniques get more refined to take advantage of the more powerful tools so it's not like you know the way that you build systematic investment strategies today is frankly at all like what you used to do 20 years ago but the basic concept is the same which is like start with core intuition understand in an expert way a design of how you want what is the thing you want to capture and then find the tools and techniques that are most appropriate for that particular problem that you're trying to solve the functional reality is those tools and techniques have come along so machine learning all these different subsets uh separate from the geni llms of the world exactly exactly and if anything i think from an investment management standpoint like a lot there's a lot more um there's a lot more richness and frankly a lot more uh effective tools that exist uh and are being developed and you know it's really it's incredible how far we've come in at least in my career you know 20 years um that are more sort of quantitative oriented ai and machine learning techniques and you know even though everyone i don't know everyone's talking about you know large language mod models and chat gpt and stuff like that like you know chat gpt from uh from at least from from my perspective of what i well the problems we're trying to solve like it's pretty good at i don't know writing haus and uh and being a joke book in your pocket but it's like not that useful in you know trading financial markets yeah it's they very focused on different applications right i think everybody has there's there's a lot of noise out there but what is it doing specifically for the challenge it it's solving your business maybe and and there are certainly people who have business problems that are of the form create essentially generic text uh and do that over and over again and so that you know so i'm not saying that there's no value in l lmm or anything uh uh at all right there's no value in them it's just it's not like it's not the problem we're trying to solve for what you're doing right for what we're doing and that that's just what it is not the problem trying to solve and and you know the worst thing you can do and this and this really i mean this is a little bit like systemization philosophy is like the worst thing you can do is bring a tool which is totally wrong a tool or technique which is totally wrong to the problem that you have at hand and it's actually you know one of the things at least and that's particularly important in the asset management business because sampling is a real problem for a lot of these techniques which are high sample size problems if you're looking for you know pictures of cats like i can essentially create an unlimited number of cats and you can identify whether it's a cat or a dog or whatever um and so your sampling size is is is huge if you're thinking about financial markets like your sample size there's a limit there's a there's a literal functional limit which is like you could look at every stock you know every minute for the last 50 years and then you're done there is no other information that's out there you know of course you can look at macro data back further than that but like the orders of magn whereas i can create essentially billions trillions of pictures of cats infinite numbers of pictures of cats essentially i cannot do the same thing with training data for financial markets and so what that highlights is that you really do need expert designed systems that are carefully thinking about techniques and thinking about the limits of those techniques which is actually a pretty big part of the story understand the limits of your techniques and think about how do you make them robust and not overly optimized because you know that they are limited you know that they're handcuffed um and so you have to be careful about how far you push the optimization uh of the approach because you might overly optimize you know your technique to back history relative to what happens in in the future uh and so you know i i think that's uh expert design systems at least in the in the uh financial market world you know are going to be around you know basically forever because uh until there is a bet you know maybe there is a next generation better solution to the low sample size problem but until we get that you really do have to have expertise in terms of thinking creatively beyond the scope of what is you know plausibly in the data set behind you yeah definitely absolutely
The Economics of Shipping,2024-07-29 05:15:00+00:00,6,B_EAFolWz98,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_EAFolWz98,how about shipping costs how do those fit into this into this puzzle as well you know does the conflict in the middle east really add to this cost for yeah i mean shipping costs are typically not a huge component of overall costs you know on the order of a few percentage points you know for like a shipped light good from asia into the united states um part of the biggest issue on uh shipping disruptions is that if you think about like demand is you know if you think demand is relatively constant let's say um and you get shipping disruptions let's just say you get supply that typically takes eight weeks and now it takes 16 weeks or something like that to come into the market that actually that's part that actually creates a real problem because people keep demanding it and demanding whatever the goods are and the supply is actually delayed um and if we were sort of always delayed then you start to build resiliency around that level of delay it's just when there's unexpected delays that that means that there's then frank like just functionally like less stuff on the shelves which functionally means that people charge more which creates a squeeze on prices and then of course you get these bull whips where you get inventory draw downs and price increases and then finally they sort of resolve the supply chain and then prices you know go from going up to going down um and demand starts to you know uh reflect that as well so that that's one of the conf confusing things about it is you kind of get these bull whips when you get this interference and so the general point of you know what i the imf actually did some very good studies on like what the incremental impact is of let's just say uh uh nash uh transpacific shipping costs go up by 100% or something like that the impact on goods prices is like you know 0.5% or 1% it's it's not that's not the big story it's not the big story the big story is the disruption probably probably because you can you know spread that cost out over so many units right right right there's so many units and and um and it's just it's just not you know the transport cost is just not that high in the scheme of things and and that should make that um that should be intuitive because like it is kind i mean it is kind of wild that we can you know that we produce things in asia and then put them on boats and have them take weeks to come to to the port of la and then and and then you know dist on trucks and trains and then distribut you know relative to producing them in our backyards and so the shipping cost must not be the big thing right uh because uh because otherwise you know if it was a huge input cost um it would it would cause you know there' be we wouldn't be producing nearly as much offshore um and so it's really about the changes in it and those changes you know have wor they were substantial during co and um i mean just the re rerouting of the ships you know away from the suz canal is like uh disruptive certainly disruptive at at a minimum mhm i remember seeing recently a video of how long it would take to pay off um you know one of these massive massive container ships um that's worth you know several hundred million dollars like three or4 hundred million dollar and you know you you initially you look at the sticker price of the ship and you think man it's going to take it's going to take this company years and years to pay this off it's like once you actually work out how many containers and how many units um you know as we're talking about this particular example the economics of it actually work out in like two trips it's it's unbelievable to think about that's wild that's wild i think the the only the only sort of core risk of this uh which sometimes uh people don't fully appreciate in the shipping uh dynamic is there is a a an elasticity issue with shipping which is it takes you know let's just say i don't know takes like a year or two to build a ship like a huge container ship um which means that if we start to get to capacity constraints in container ships and and there are capacity constraints um again going to that length of time the length of time is actually a real problem because imagine instead of every good traveling in four weeks that has to travel in eight weeks well then i mean to oversimplify you would need twice as many ships on the seas right uh to deliver the same amount of goods you know that's that's a that's a g you know a toy example but it kind of gives you an intuition around it and so um you know and because the goods that are sitting in the port of shanghai are worth essentially zero in shanghai and they're only worth capital if they're sitting in the port of la or long beach um the elasticity of shipping prices shipping prices are way more volatile than you know goods prices because uh if you know if there's a constraint on the supply of ships then you know you're out there bidding your ship because you want to get your good uh you know on the transpacific um and delivered into the market and so that's why you see such huge volatility you know 100% price increase in shipping cost is not not unusual by any stretch
"U.S.  Economy is Slowing, but Analysts’ Earnings Expectations Remain Elevated",2024-07-26 12:15:04+00:00,8,rwSXIa0cAk8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwSXIa0cAk8,in particular looking at the consumption uh measures i think are very interesting along this along this dynamic uh first quarter gdp showed a moderation of uh end consumer spending contribution to gdp growth moving down to about 1% in terms of contribution that's about half of what it was in the second half of last year and then you're also seeing in more timely measures for instance uh in the personal consumption expenditures uh you're seeing those measures pretty flat for the second quarter those measures just growth on their own about 0.8% annualized for uh the first two months of the second quarter that have been reported we'll find out the rest at the end of this month when the full gdp report comes out but odds are we'll see personal consumption be you know pretty modest over the course of the second quarter and again part of that general gradual deceleration that we're seeing in the economy at the same time on the flip side you know we've talked a lot about if' been around here long enough you you've heard me talk about the income driven expansion and so the labor markets are very important in the very important lynch pen in terms of continuing to drive uh the macroeconomy forward and to continue to get you know reasonably good spending and growth and what we've seen there is not a significant weakening of the labor market but we have seen some moderation across a number of different measures in the labor market uh here showing the timeliest measures seen with the the claims data uh the initial claims data which good indication of the rate of firings is still pretty stable relative to you know uh where we've been the thing that we're starting to see is that continuing claims data it's starting to creep up it's low in any absolute sense but it's starting to creep up reflecting the fact that uh some folks are get feeling a little bit more challenge in moving from unemployment back to employment ment uh so the lengthening of the duration of employment now these are the sorts of things that in you know this is not a uh fastpac recessionary uh curve uh you in order to see that you'd have to probably see uh a much steeper curve over there on initial claims with firings but it is indicative of some softening of the overall labor market and i think um you know the ba the basic dynamic if you look under the hood looking at the jel data is it's not it's not a uh it's not a slow down it's not a significant slowdown driven uh uh labor weakening what we're seeing more is essentially just a hesitancy to hire so what we're seeing quits you know soft relative to history about at the preco rate and we're seeing firings that's layoffs and discharges those are at the pre-co rate or maybe just a touch below uh both of those would indicate that you know there's there's not a lot of you labor's not really moving around very much people companies are fine with the labor that they have the main area that's the outlier is that the hiring rate has moderated to some extent and so that's what you're seeing here uh on the leand side are the the quits and layoffs and discharges and there on the right hand side is the hiring rate which is you know low relative to the pre-co pace noted uh in the line there and as a result of the slowing of uh of growth the slowing of employment growth uh we're basically seeing a slowing of nominal demand and so we've talked at length about how um this is an income driven expansion that income is being driven by uh continued uh employment growth as well as wage growth but those elements are softening like we talked about last month and so we're seeing the sort of gradual softening of nominal incomes down to about 5% give or take on an annualized growth basis and that's corresponding with a softening of overall nominal consumption which is also growing about uh 5% at this point so that puts us in a overall dynamic nominal growth about 5% nominal spending about 5% that's not a terrible environment for uh economic conditions ahead it's just certainly not consistent with a significant growth acceleration that's being expected for instance in analyst expectations and that's really the outlier here and and it's you know it's challenging in these sorts of environments um because you know when it's clear that there's a direction that the economy is going in terms of moving to a quick recession or moving to a boom and a lot of times you can follow the momentum and you don't have to get too worried about exactly what's priced in because the momentum by itself is sufficient uh to tell you you know which direction to go in these late cycle environments it's a bit different most of us haven't seen these late cycle environments but if you go back and study the ones in the 50s and the 60s and you study them across countries it's very normal that you get in a late cycle environment growth that continues to uh to the growth that continues but starts to moderate as the central bank titans in response to elevated inflation pressures but expectations which are almost always based on backward looking d uh experience continue to expect relatively strong growth just as the economy is slowing and so what we see here uh amongst analyst expectations in the equity market is very consistent with that sort of very classic late cycle dynamic you know if we look at the equity market we look at uh in this case s&p 500 uh eps over the course of the last eight quarters it's basically been flat there's been a lot of movement under the hood in terms of who is gaining and who isn't uh but the big picture is eight quarters flat earnings but when we look at how analysts are expecting to see uh earnings grow over the course of the next 12 to 24 months they're expecting a boom in earnings growth 177% year-over-year earnings growth expected by the end of the fourth quarter and a combination of near uh 30% earnings growth over the course of uh by the end of calendar year 20125 in comparison to calendar year 2023 those are huge numbers huge earnings growth uh that are expected uh particularly in light of the fact that we've had basically flat earn earnings growth over the course of the last couple of years uh just to draw some perspective on that if we look at how earnings growth has played out uh over the course of the last you know couple of cycles it's not unheard of to have earnings growth in sort of the mid double digigit range uh even for a couple of years the thing that's unusual about it is that it would happen at the late cycle rather than coming out of a bottom so we have seen earnings growth consistent with what's expected for instance coming out of covid coming out of the financial crisis and after a lot of effort coming out of the tech bus uh but in no cases have we seen earnings growth persist at that level for multiple years uh in a late cycle environment and so what is being expected is basically very strong earnings growth at a time when the economy is slowing in response to the tightening
Inflation Prints in Mid July 2024,2024-07-25 05:15:03+00:00,5,pGkbU--ezqw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGkbU--ezqw,you know inflation has uh has printed a couple of soft months um we have seen soft months in the past revert there's some real questions about whether uh we're seeing true disinflation or simply uh or or how much of it is being impacted by seasonal measurement issues which overstated the inflation earlier in the year and maybe understating the inflation this year we saw a similar pattern happened last year as well i i i think the basic question is you know given the circumstance where we have inflation that you know even with a couple of weak prints is still elevated relative to the fed's mandate and we have an environment where well we're seeing some softening in labor markets we're not really seeing an acute softening in labor markets if you look at for instance prime age uh working percentage so the percent of prime age population that are employed it's basically at secular high and has been flat for 18 um that's not an environment of that requires swift cuts to be delivered by the fed and so while there is certainly some desire from the fed uh to normalize normalize in their in their words not in mine to move interest rates down if we get easier inflation on the concern that there might be weaker dynamics in the labor market it odds are that this is all this whole process is going to move a lot slower than and be bumpier than the sort of straight line expectations that are currently expected in the markets i mean just look at what we see here on services x shelter which ultimately arbitrage to wages services x shelter you know there's lots of details under the hood um that that in terms of exactly how it gets measured but at a big picture level services x shelter is a function of either input costs like oil prices basically oil prices and gas prices or wages well what we've seen is two months of extraordinarily low services uh x shelter numbers notably we saw the same very very low set of numbers emerge last summer over the course of the same months raising the question about whether there's some sort of seasonal isue here uh and in a way that to be frank is implausible uh this sort of shift from being elev you know from running at uh four or five or six% to running at basically zero over the course of two months that's not how that's not how price growth works in the economy um and if you look and triangulate other measures of inflation core inflation surveys consumer expectations things like that there's basically been no change over the course of the last year and so much more likely that what we're seeing here is noise in the data rather than big shifts in the reality and so you you put that together with the fact that wage information continues to suggest that wages will remain wage growth will remain elevated in comparison to to pre uh to preco levels and where we're seeing productivity continue to be mediocre productivity growth to be mediocre at best uh these numbers are through the first quarter uh the second quarter is going to basically be the same 1.5% growth 1.5% employment growth that's 0% productivity you know an environment where we're seeing wage growth say eci at four to five% and at the same time we're seeing zero productivity growth that combination is not a combination that's going to lead to a significant wage disinflation while some numbers have come down things like average hourly earnings many of those numbers have composition issues and they're more reflective of the shifting composition of incremental employment than they are a reflection of the shifts in overall wages big picture is wage growth is growing a couple points higher where we were preco and productivity growth is growing weaker than where we were preco
"Supply Chain, Prices and Nominal Growth (and Their Impact on Economic Cycles)",2024-07-24 12:15:06+00:00,6,Zy1wbhOmUW8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy1wbhOmUW8,um how much of the extended cycle this time do you believe was a result of uh the interventionist uh central bank policy in march of 2023 and the reason i say that is because in q4 of 22 we did have a contraction in those cyclical elements of the economy you had residential investment that was contracting you had a very uh sharp uh uh slowdown in durable goods consumption uh and then you had um uh a a situation where uh credit was uh on the brink of tightening very aggressively which presumably would have perpetuated a downturn in those cyclical areas of the economy it was alleviated one through um the bank term funding program facility uh two by sort of a blanket guarantee on uninsured deposits which was something of an unprecedented uh uh move so uh that that took the uh lending growth in um the banking sector from what was a pretty sharp gradient decline uh to one that was more of an l-shaped uh degradation as you say um now that again is catching up to us where we're slowing down again so how much do you think that that policy action uh extended the cycle um if at all i think um in a lot of ways we've we had you know some of those elements that look like very weak real growth in 2022 were in part a function of supply chain issues and prices right and you know we had if you go back and look at the nominal growth story then it wasn't it was not that bad um during that period i mean it stayed elevated and started to come out sorry for the funny uh funny lighting situation i just we just moved in here and uh and i'm still trying to get my production studio uh you still look good bob don't worry in good shape um the uh you know i think back in the in that in the 202 22 period we had a spike in inflation for sure um part of that was because we had a a r a big rise in input prices part of it was because we had you know the supply chain issues went on longer than people expected right and part of it was because you know incomes were finally catching up with the elevated prices from before and so you had this circumstance where there wasn't enough supply relative to the nominal demand that existed in that economy at the time and essentially had to be resolved through price instead of production because there literally wasn't any production you know you you couldn't you couldn't meet the production growth like of course people would have preferred heard to have met you know that demand with production but they they just didn't have the capacity to meet that demand with production and so i think that's part of the part of the reason why i think that was a bit of a head fake at that time and at the time that's sort of when i started this you know my weekly updates about the employment situation and stuff like that um which i know famous for you you love uh and um and the reason why i did at the time was because i you if you saw employment start to slow right so not just rationalize you know rationing the nominal demand with price but starting to create layoffs then that was going to be a signal that that cycle that cycle that flowed back into weaker you know the the weaker real uh production cycle with weaker real inc weaker incomes was actually going to that flywheel was going to begin to slow down in the economy but we didn't really see the labor market slow too much and instead we just saw high nominal income growth high nominal spending and high prices and so that's that's sort of the that's the way i would characterize how we sort of got through that period i think today is a bit different in the sense of like a lot of that income growth is decayed i mean just functionally like there's less employment growth there's a lot less employment growth a lot less you know wage growth has is still high higher than it was preco but it's not uh nearly as high as it was back then and you put those two things together and we just have much less spending power that exists for households today spending power growth than existed back in that period and so that's where this transition to slowing you know i don't know slowing but moderately growing uh is kind of where we are right now and that's a very interesting moment because um that is something that isn't necessarily going to um it's not like the economy's going to fall off a cliff in that circumstance it's just that that is that is not the sort of dynamic that's going to that's a deceleration dynamic not an acceleration dynamic
Financial Markets and Macroeconomics,2024-07-23 12:15:01+00:00,6,F2m7GFktOoE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2m7GFktOoE,"wonder if you could talk about how you would analyze a price target like that using this framework i i think um markets are not uh divorced from macroeconomic reality that's you know of course any price could be uh could be uh divergent for macroeconomic reality for you know for periods of time we've certainly seen plenty of that in our uh in our careers um but part of what and end up happening what ends up eventually driving asset prices is the macroeconomic reality for instance let's not forget you know there was like seven cuts priced in uh for the us for 2024 you know only six and a half months ago right but what policy actually transpired ended up being you know isn't divorced from the macroeconomic reality that occur right that that's you know that's the cor lary and so the same is the same is true for companies and and and stock prices of course there's bubbles there's busts there can be divergences but ultimately you know companies are stock markets are made of companies companies generate cash flows uh you know they generate earnings those earnings uh are purchased on certain multiples and so you can start to think about what are the ranges the and and sorry and those earnings are a function of sales those function of sales is a function of economic expansion whether they can pick up market share in the economy and so you can start to think about you know what are reasonable expectations uh in terms of what you'd expect so take a very simple example you know leave the 15,000 aside it's like five and a half years from now like you know who knows but just take for a simple example like today s&p 500 earnings are expected to be 177% year-over-year by the end of the fourth quarter okay so very simply how do you get to you know how do you get to 17% year-over-year earnings growth in the s&p 500 well you have to have some combination of margins and revenues that get you to 177% growth if you think of the s&p 500 companies as being a broadly diversified basket of companies uh that are reflective of you know the broad economy well if n growth in the us economy is let's say 5 to 6% just to be you know that that's that would be pretty good actually 5 to 6% over the course of 2024 if that's the case that that's what nominal growth looks like sorry for the lighting thing um then if that's the case then the way you get to 17% is you have to have you know margin expansion right margins are already expected you know are already at secular highs how do you get even more margin expansion from where we are today right to make up for the you know to get another 12% earnings growth well you have to have margins go up you know uh a a point point and a half okay well what are margins margins are just um the difference between sales and what your what the sales cost you and what's the biggest cost labor okay but there's an intersection between those two points which is a very important point which is if you pay labor less then they spend less right those two things are linked to each other that people often forget this um this comes up a lot like with the ai story they're like ai is going to create a productivity boom and companies are going to be able to fire a lot of people okay if you fire people then they have less money to spend right those two things are related to each other right this is why you can't have a stock market revenues are not disconnected from wage growth because people need money to spend and so if you think about that in a play how do you get the margins well the only way you get margin expansion is if there's de savings because it's only through the process of de savings that one can spend more than their income and so that's how that interplay works so let's get to that 17% number well if you take 5 to 6% nominal growth 5% nominal growth let's just say because the economy is slowing then i still need 12% to happen with margin expansion okay who are households going to borrow more are businesses going to do more cash capex and borrow more is the government deficit going to widen considerably like who is going to do what to lead to that expansion it's not disconnected from reality it has to exist in the context of the macroeconomy so i think that's people like that's such an important thing and it's the thing if you went through the 2000 cycle and you heard you all sorts of stories new economy companies are disconnected nope the 2000 cycle worked exactly the same way which is that you know ultimately earnings were not disconnected from the real economy and the real economy has limitations that's kind of the the interplay between all of those different pieces and you could think about that on a one-year time frame or on a five and a half year time fr"
Luck vs Skill in Investing?,2024-07-22 12:15:08+00:00,4,yC3tac5Q1bw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC3tac5Q1bw,luck and skill when evaluating the outcomes of investments you know it's something that i read about um a long a long time ago i think it was in the it was in a book called the art of thinking clearly and it's something that i i go through quite a bit in in my thinking of trying to understand the the analysis of getting something right versus just getting lucky so how do you go through thinking about that yeah it's a critical question whenever you're thinking about um an asset manager um it can often be very challenging to separate that luck versus the skill and in particular because people can always back rationalize why they held a certain set of positions and explain why those returns came the way that they did i i think there's probably there's probably two um two ways in which i would think about that problem the first way is to think about it uh from a sample siiz perspective um you know the the higher probability uh that you're uh you know there's a much higher probability that luck has a more meaningful influence when you have lower sample size um and i think we all sort of know the stories of you know people who called one or one and a half big shorts and then for the subsequent 15 years couldn't couldn't make any money because they got lucky you know it not totally luck but they were certainly helped meaningfully by luck on a small sample size outcome and so part of the thing you want to look at is you want to look at that sample size um you know you could start to see and start to believe in skill increasingly when you have more and more bets that you can look at over more and more time through more and more cycles i actually think from that perspective the last five years is actually a really good time frame to evaluate a lot of managers and the why that is is the last five years we' basically experienced every macroeconomic environment you possibly could have experienced and so from there you get a pretty good sense as to whether or not the return outcomes that you're seeing are they just simply following the market or is there something differentiated relative to that so sample size uh across market environments and across number of bets and time and things like that important and then you have to link that to process um a lot of times people will just look at outcomes and they'll say okay well you know that person called the fact that stocks were you know were going to be up for a long you know since october of uh 20122 and therefore they're smart and you're like okay but if what their process is is to just say buy stocks buy stocks buy stocks is that a process is that or is that luck versus people who have who can bring a compelling reason why their outcomes are repeatable because that's what you care about you actually don't care about what historical returns are because they're totally useless to you you cannot achieve historical returns in the future so what you have to see is what is the process because the process will define what the future outcomes will be and that's that's the most important thing pairing those two things the empirical observation through significant samplize with a process you put those two things together if you can get something that's reasonable uh and and reasonably reliable then you can have more confidence it's a matter of skill not luck

Traders’ Early Success in Investing is Not Helpful,2024-07-18 05:15:02+00:00,6,W4zUUftXIMI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4zUUftXIMI,"the the first thing to recognize is um there is a lot of luck involved okay and i think that's really important because what that should do is that should give you the humility luck can be good for you um and you can you know you can look better than the reality and get overconfident so you know when you're on the path you know when you're on a streak of winners you should check yourself a little bit because that may not be the reality of how good you actually are and the last thing you want to do is double down into into a more difficult period of time and give back all of the g and give back all of your gams and that's the biggest that is the biggest risk the pro the biggest the biggest risk for most folks starting off trading markets is that they are successful early now that is a crazy thing to say right but the reason why that is is if you're successful early then you don't have the humility of recognizing that you might be wrong and what that range is you need edge right and you could probably have edge um but that edge is only so good and it's almost never as good as if when you're on the hot streak of course right so everyone's a genius in a bull market tell ti rolls i mean as traders i think we've all gone through this because maybe we joined some program with their were profitable signals and at the beginning you have this unrealistic expectation and then the issue that i dealt with was kind of like chasing a high so like the easy money that comes off the first five trades and you're like $500 to 5,000 i could i'm going to become the next i'm going to crash the pound and then so what i love what you said is that you should humble yourself before the market humbles you because it's a lot less painful to selfcheck rather than the market to give you a reality check right that's right that's right i think you can always tell a person who's really traded markets for a long time because they have like you'll pull up a chart of a market and they'll have the scars they'll be like i remember this trade this trade at this time and i got i got hammered on it you know for me for me it was i was lucky cuz when i started out m i um i in in the 2000s i thought i should trade natural gas and why why trade natural gas not because i knew anything about it because it's was the most volatile commodity i could trade and i lost my entire first year bonus on trading natural gas cuz i didn't have any idea what i was doing this is desert storm era this is this is yeah wow wow wow this the most volatile period for that gas exactly exactly that was your first like i should trade natural gas and you know what happened is i made a bunch of money in the first you know few months and then gave it all back and then some through the rest of the year and it was it was the best money i've ever spent in my life because i said wow this is a lot harder this takes a lot more discipline than just you know gambling yeah right and that you got to get your mind out of that story it's not this is not gambling and the high of winning and and thinking that you're the most successful person that's out there and you're more skilled than everyone else like the most successful asset managers in the world are humbled every day by the asset market so should you but it also doesn't mean that you can't generate alpha over time if you stick to the to a strategy that generate that you know can consistently generate alpha it's just it's not it's not just all winners it's not like you know just clipping coupons on a bond there's ups and there's downs and there's noise mh and so you have to have the discipline to keep playing your edge over and over and over again and not get too extended on anyone trade you know at any point in time and and basically give yourself the most bets that you possibly can it's like counting cards at the table right if you're betting too big on any individual hand couple hands in your bust you're going to wipe yourself out but what you want to do is you want to just you want to bet enough give yourself a cushion to give yourself a cushion to be able you want to if you're doing this well your trading markets 30 years later right that's what that's the goal if you want to have that in your mind that's the discipline that you want to have in your mind that's incredible it seems like the recurring theme you keep talking about is a perspective of what of the reality of the game the nature of the game the uncertainty of the game and if you you can be successful but you have to accept the nature of the uncertainty that's right and the people that seem to struggle the most see expect some kind of uh certain approach like there has to be a mechanical like system to it and really the uncertainty is really where alpha managers thrive because you can accept i guess the anxiety of uncertainty well i think i think a big part of um a part of the sort of um quiet reason the often not talked about reason of why many asset managers can be successful over time is that they control their risks really well right so you know take a bunch of managers that have the same edge in the market right some that are very good at risk controlling you know controlling their risk and not taking too much bet on one particular bet or you know constraining draw downs and things like that and other that you know get get lucky on a roll and then get caught being overconfident they could all have the same edge but the one that's going to be the most successful over time is the disciplined conservative risk-managed player that is going to you know that shows up every day you know that's what that's what you have to do every single day come in and play your edge and play it effectively in a disciplined way"
Political Uncertainty and  Financial  Market Impact,2024-07-17 12:15:06+00:00,5,qSLJG2KH4P4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSLJG2KH4P4,well when we look at what's going on in the market action today and really um since uh what happened over the weekend uh where we saw an increase in odds that trump would be elected uh to the presidency we're seeing market action largely consistent with those increased odds and so if you go line by line in terms of the market action what we're seeing is actually gold as one of the best performing assets uh in the market reflective of the fact that we're like to get large deficits ahead uh as the republicans have a higher probability of controlling all three chambers of the us government we're seeing bonds sell off as a function of uh growth likely being stronger and having those larger deficits and higher inflation and we're seeing uh some stock rally but not that much stock rally uh in in the market reflecting the fact that it's going to be challenging uh to keep up this level of growth with with those level of deficits and upward pressure on interest rates so you put that all together it's not necessarily a great environment for overall asset prices but it does favor gold and stocks relative to bonds and one last thing to highlight is of course it's been favorable to bitcoin uh as the trump administration has uh pivoted and indicated a positive stance towards uh various crypto assets and that's likely to be part of the reason why bitcoin's rallying here as well bob um i i can as we continue to sort of parse out what each candidate's chances means for the markets i keep going back to 2016 but there are lots of other examples where marker participants thought that a candidate who then won the presidency was going to mean one thing and it didn't necessarily mean that thing so as you are trying to strategize based around all of this how are you sort of trying to factor in the uncertainty uh level here well i think there's still a fair amount of uncertainty in terms of um what exactly the policy mix is going to be i think we're in a bit of a different circumstance than where we were back in 2016 we have a track record of policies uh measures that uh both administrations have pursued uh over the course of their time in office and we have pretty welldeveloped uh perspective in terms of what incremental policies will be so i think we're in a lot better shape a lot less uncertainty than maybe existed before i think probably the increased uncertainty starts to emerge as we start to get to a higher probability that the republicans control all three uh branches of government in that case there's a lot less constraints on policymaking than may have otherwise uh existed in more divided government and as a result uh certain policies might be pursued that wouldn't have otherwise been pursued or even talked about during the campaign period and so i think it's very important to recognize that probably uncertainty increases as the probability of uh full control uh also increases is your sense bob uh you mentioned there divided government is your sense markets would would actually prefer divided government i think there's uh a balance in terms of uh you know the a divided government is a lot more certain uh whether it's uh led by a republican administration or a democratic administration uh i think there's a lot of uh you know pretty much uh business as usual would likely transpire if we have a divided government i think the challenge is we get to a bit more uncertainty uh as control of all three chambers emerges and so i think that's the the the balance is probably uh more increase of control by the republicans would lead to uh even more deficit spending and particularly corporate beneficial deficit spending uh but there's some uncertainty about that and i think uh what we're seeing in the stock market not really rallying a ton on the incremental news is a reflection of that balance of increased uncertainty m more favorable policy but also increased uncertainty
Unlimited Macroeconomic Webinar July 2024,2024-07-16 12:15:03+00:00,53,KX-yL_O9FTs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX-yL_O9FTs,[music] here's our uh monthly macro webinar uh for july 2024 focused on growing but slowing i think if we think about what uh has happened with the us economy in particular over the course of the last say six to 12 months there was an extended period of time where there was concerns about whether the us economy would continue uh to expand if you go back just at the beginning of this year uh you know interest rates were priced to cut six or seven times uh the bond yield was as low as 375 on the 10-year uh analyst expectations for us growth in 2024 was something close to 1% uh and uh all of that in the face of what had been the most stimulative financial conditions over the previous uh 8 to 12 weeks that had existed in 40 or 50 years and at the time uh if you check out our outlook to start off the year we said uh stronger for longer was the outlook so while the markets were pricing in quite weak economic conditions and fed tightening we were saying the conditions were lining up for a stronger but long stronger for longer economic environment and that really played out significantly over the course in particular of the first quarter and to some extent in the second quarter where stocks outperformed bonds uh and where the priced in cuts uh into the into the interest rate curve at six to7 faded to as little as one with even some t at one point uh a couple of months ago about whether the fed might the fed's next move might be to hike um that was a big shift the primary reason why that shift occurred was uh there's a big shift in expectations and us growth expectations that's what you see here on the rightand chart which you know there's lots of different ways to look at this but i think economists consensus expectations for growth is a pretty good way to look at it pretty simple measure to look at and what you see there is a rapid shift in economist expectations in terms of us growth for 2024 from that 1% to kickoff a little bit below uh all the way up to 2.4% uh and just ticking down here in the most recent period that was a remarkable shift now i think a lot of folks you might look at equities and you might say hey look stocks are up because of ai measures or big tech big mega cap tech etc as a macro investor i look at the world through uh the growth and inflation lens and of course within an equity market there are winners and there are losers but from a macro lens what happened in the first half of the year was actually quite normal which is there was a upside growth expect upside growth surprise in terms of expectations stocks rallied bonds sold off the dollar strengthened it was a pretty good you know and and as those expectations shifted now what's happened here which i think is an important dynamic is whenever you're thinking about uh trading markets you're always thinking about what is likely to transpire relative to what's priced in and so when we look at things like the equity market today what we see is priced in is for a continuation of very strong growth the sort of very strong growth that we saw over the course of uh 2023 the second half of 2023 uh and that uh that is uh unlikely uh given the set of circumstances you know that level of strength is unlikely given the dynamics that we're seeing in the economy and those dynamics are you know the continued elevated interest rate environment is continuing to grind on economic activity on ongoing basis and it's continuing to slowly weaken economic conditions this isn't an acute crisis like 2008 or something like that or even uh bubble bust the way we saw in 2000 this is in many ways a very normal cyclical late late cycle slowdown as a in response to a significant tightening environment and that's basically what we see here our friend eric over at epb research does a great job creating these sort of timely and comprehensive coincident growth measures and here you see uh in his work just showing that shifting down of what's going on in the economy from very strong in 2022 to pretty strong in 2023 running you know in the ballpark of between two and 3% and then really over the last six months what we've seen is a shift down to something like oneish percent one to one and a half percent real growth in the us economy now that's not bad one and one and a half% real growth in the us economy is probably enough to generally keep labor markets uh in pretty good shape not deteriorate the unemployment rate rapidly uh and it's you know good enough to keep uh the economy going to some extent but what it isn't is consistent with expectations of booming growth that have been priced in uh to analyst expectations and to the stock market and so that's what you see here if you just take 2.3% uh growth over the course of 2024 which is currently expected with one quarter first quarter gdp at 1.4% and uh you take for granted basically the atlanta fed measures which are about 1.5% give or take if you put that all together uh and that's for the second quarter what that would imply is that we're like that expectations are that in the second half of the year we're going to have one of the greatest you know growth booms that we've had in the postco environment and that is improbable given the momentum that we're seeing in the economy doesn't mean that we're getting a recession it just means the odds that we get such an elevated growth environment seem uh unlikely ahead we see this in a couple different ways the slowdown i think in particular looking at the consumption uh measures i think are very interesting along this along this dynamic uh first quarter gdp showed a moderation of uh end consumer spending contribution to gdp growth moving down to about per in terms of contribution that's about half of what it was in the second half of last year and then you're also seeing in more timely measures for instance uh in the personal consumption expenditures uh you're seeing those measures pretty flat for the second quarter those measures just growth on their own about 0.8% annualized for uh the first two months of the second quarter that have been reported we'll find out the rest at the end of this month when the full gdp report comes out but odds are we'll see personal consumption be you know pretty modest over the course of the second quarter and again part of that general gradual deceleration that we're seeing in the economy at the same time on the flip side you know we've talked a lot about if' been around here long enough you you've heard me talk about the income driven expansion and so the labor markets are very important in the very important lynch pen in terms of continuing to drive uh the macroeconomy forward and to continue to get you know reasonably good spending and growth and what we've seen there is not a significant weakening of the labor market but we have seen some moderation across a number of different measures in the labor market uh here showing the timeliest measures seen with the the claims data uh the initial claims data which good indication of the rate of firings is still pretty stable relative to you know uh where we've been the thing that we're starting to see is that continuing claims data it's starting to creep up it's low in any absolute sense but it's starting to creep up reflecting the fact that uh some folks are get feeling a little bit more challenge in moving from unemployment back to employment uh so the lengthening of the duration of employment now these are the sorts of things that in you know this is not a uh fast-paced recessionary uh curve uh you in order to see that you'd have to probably see uh a much steeper curve over there on initial claims with firings but it is indicative of some softening of the overall labor market and i think um you know the ba the basic dynamic if you look under the hood looking at the jolts data is it's not it's not a uh it's not a slow down it's not a significant slowdown driven uh uh labor weakening what we're seeing more is essentially just a hesitancy to hire so what we're seeing quits you know soft relative to history about at the preco rate and we're seeing firings that's layoffs and discharges those are at the pre-co rate or maybe just a touch below uh both of those would indicate that you know there's there's not a lot of you labor's not really moving around very much people companies are fine with the labor that they have the main area that's the outlier is that the hiring rate has moderated to some extent and so that's what you're seeing here uh on the left-and side are the the quits and layoffs and discharges and there on the right hand side is the hiring rate which is you know low relative to the pre-co pace noted uh in the line there and as a result of the slowing of uh of growth the slowing of employment growth uh we're basically seeing a slowing of nominal demand and so we've talked at length about how um this is an income driven expansion that income is being driven by uh continued uh employment growth as well as wage growth but those elements are softening like we talked about last month and so we're seeing this sort of gradual softening of nominal incomes down to about 5% give or take on an annualized growth basis and that's corresponding with a softening of overall nominal consumption which is also growing about about uh 5% at this point so that puts us in a overall dynamic nominal growth about 5% nominal spending about 5% that's not a terrible environment for uh economic conditions ahead it's just certainly not consistent with a significant growth acceleration that's being expected for instance in analyst expectations and that's really the outlier here and and it's you know it's challenging in these sorts of en environments um because you know when it's clear that there's a direction that the economy is going in terms of moving to a quick recession or moving to a boom and a lot of times you can follow the momentum and you don't have to get too worried about exactly what's priced in because the momentum by itself is sufficient uh to tell you you know which direction to go in these late cycle environments it's a bit different most of us haven't seen these late cycle environments but if you go back and studi the ones in the 50s and the 60s and you study them across countries it's very normal that you get in a late cycle environment growth that continues to uh to the growth that continues but starts to moderate as the central bank tightens in response to elevated inflation pressures but expectations which are almost always based on backward-looking d uh experience continue to expect relatively strong growth just as the economy is slowing and so what we see here uh amongst analyst expectations in the equity market is very consistent with that sort of very classic late cycle dynamic you know if we look at the equity market we look at uh in this case s&p 500 uh eps over the course of the last eight quarters it's basically been flat there's been a lot of movement under the hood in terms of who is gaining and who isn't uh but the big picture is eight quarters flat earnings but when we look at how analysts are expecting to see uh earnings grow over the course of the next 12 to 24 months they're expecting a boom in earnings growth 177% year-over-year earnings growth expected by the end of the fourth quarter and a combination of near uh 30% earnings growth over the course of uh by the end of calendar year 2025 in comparison to calendar year 2023 those are huge numbers huge earnings growth uh that are expected uh particularly in light of the fact that we've had basically flat earn earnings growth over the course of the last couple of years uh just to draw some perspective on that if we look at how earnings growth has played out uh over the course of the last you know couple of cycles it's not unheard of to have earnings growth in sort of the mid double digigit range uh even for a couple of years the thing that's un usual about it is that it would happen at the late cycle rather than coming out of a bottom so we have seen earnings growth consistent with what's expected for instance coming out of covid coming out of the financial crisis and after a lot of effort coming out of the tech bus uh but in no cases have we seen earnings growth persist at that level for multiple years uh in a late cycle environment and so what is being expected is basically very strong earnings growth at a time when the economy is slowing in response to the tightening the only way you know the way that this can this can work is basically either need a margin you know you either need sales growth or you need margin expansion and i think that's very important to think about when you're thinking about how could how could for instance 17% earnings growth be achieved well at a s&p 500 level the big picture story is that s&p 500 revenues are generally going to move with gdp growth uh in the us and then to some extent abroad because about 40% of sales are are abroad and that nominal gdp growth is probably going to be four or five% in fact analysts will pencil out four or five% have penciled out four or five% uh for earning for revenue growth over the course of the next couple of years so b basally penciling out with g nominal gdp the thing that is driving such an elevated expansion uh in earnings expectations is margins margins which have been uh flat although close to near highs over the course of the last couple of years are expected to rise 2.5% to be higher uh than any time in history over the course of the next two years now 2.5% margin increase uh over the course of uh you know that's that's margin going from about you know 12 to 14 and a half or something like that or uh 12 and a half up close to 15 that is a heck of a that's a heck of a margin expansion that's being expected uh by uh analysts and so the question is how can that get achieved how can you get such an incredible margin expansion in an environment where um you're very late cycle and labor markets are pretty tight uh it's it's hard to see how that play out because classically if you have in order to get margin expansion someone in the economy has to dis save uh because if you get it through labor margins as a simple example what ends up happening is if you uh you know your revenues are a function of the spending uh of the spenders in the economy so consumers primarily although to some extent businesses and your costs are associated with the incomes paid to the consumers in the economy and so you can't get a margin expansion for free it can't just happen some people will say hey look there's going to be a productivity boom so margins are going to expand okay that can't that that doesn't work it doesn't work then and and people who went back and learned this in the in the tech bust uh that that's not how it works because if the productivity doesn't flow to incomes then the spending available doesn't happen and as a result the topline revenues can't be achieved and so someone in the economy has to disa the question is who will disave households have been very conservative with their dis savings businesses are disinterested in dissaving uh or borrowing given the current level of interest rates and the government is already already running relatively extreme deficits uh particularly in light of c health conditions and so that's the main question that has to be answered is you know how will such extreme margins get achieved in light of the fact that that is the only path to get the sort of extremely elevated earnings expectations that are currently priced in now let's if we if we turn our attention to inflation uh obviously a lot of information that came out today uh got a lot of of focus with a slightly weaker than expectation uh inflation print you know i i think the from the fed's perspective when you look at that dynamic uh you know inflation has uh has printed a couple of soft months um we have seen soft months in the past revert there's some real questions about whether uh we're seeing true disinflation or simply uh or or how much of it is being impacted by seasonal measurement issues which overstated the inflation earlier in the year and maybe understating the inflation this year year we saw a similar pattern happen last year as well i i i think the basic question is you know given the circumstance where we have inflation that you know even with a couple of weak prints is still elevated relative to the fed's mandate and we have an environment where well we're seeing some softening in labor markets we're not really seeing an acute softening in labor markets if you look at for instance prime age uh working percentage so the percent of prime age population that are employed it's basically at secular highs and has been flat for 18 um that's not an environment of that requires swift cuts to be delivered by the fed and so while there is certainly some desire from the fed uh to normalize normalize in their in their words not in mind to move interest rates down if we get easier inflation on the concern that there might be weaker dynamics in the labor market it odds are that this is all this whole process is going to move a lot slower than and be bumpier than the sort of straight line expectations that are currently expected in the markets i mean just look at what we see here on services x shelter which ultimately arbitrage to wages services x shelter you know there's lots of details under the hood um that that in terms of exactly how it gets measured but at a big picture level services x shelter is a function of either input costs like oil prices basically oil prices and gas prices or wages well what we've seen is two months of extraordinarily low services uh x shelter numbers notably we saw the same very very low set of numbers emerge last summer over the course of the same months raising the question about whether there's some sort of seasonal issue here uh and in a way that to be frank is implausible uh this sort of shift from being elev you know from running at uh four five or six% to running at basically zero over the course of two months that's not how that's not how price growth works in the economy um and if you look and triangulate other measures of inflation core inflation surveys consumer expectations things like that there's basically been no change over the course of the last year and so much more likely that what we're seeing here is noise in the data rather than big shifts in the reality and so you you put that together with the fact that wage information continues to suggest that wages will remain wage growth will remain elevated in comparison to to pre uh to preco levels and where we're seeing productiv continue to be mediocre productivity growth to be mediocre at best uh these numbers are through the first quarter uh the second quarter is going to basically be the same 1.5% growth 1.5% employment growth that's 0% productivity you know an environment where we're seeing wage growth say eci at four to 5% and at the same time we're seeing zero productivity growth that combination is not a combination that's going to lead to a significant wage disinflation while some numbers have come down things like average hourly earnings many of those numbers have composition issues and they're more reflective of the shifting composition of incremental employment than they are a reflection of the shifts in overall wages big picture is wage growth is growing a couple points higher where we were preco and productivity growth is growing weaker than where we were preco in addition uh the numbers today were uh significantly reduced by a uh a low uh oar or shelter print uh that was uh an unusual print while uh we've seen some of the measures of uh of market-based rents particularly new tenant rents uh falling uh the all tenant rent index has continued to remain elevated that's what you see here over on the left hand side uh has continued to remain elevated and today's numbers were an outlier relative to uh the reference all tenant uh rental rate index uh that is published and generally leads on a you know on a smooth basis the type of rent costs rent growth costs that we're seeing and so you look there and you sort of say look that you know the services x shelter number looks you know these look relatively significantly weak uh compared to what's been happening in the period before it's a big shift you look at the rent numbers they look soft relative to the reference index the main point here is in no way would you sort of sit here and say it is certain that inflation's beat and i'm sure the fed is prudent enough to recognize that sure on the margin the balance of the pressures are now you know the pressures are now more balanced between you know inflationary pressures and labor but what that doesn't mean is you know enter a huge cutting site ccle uh necessarily and that's you know and that's to to be clear when you're when you're trading the markets again you have to be looking at things relative to expectations and as we look at expectations today you know we've already priced in uh something like 150 cuts over the course of uh 150 base points of cuts over the course of uh something like uh a year uh you know is that possible it's certainly possible uh but you look at this balance of pressures and it certainly doesn't look like the type of pressures that would typically align with a very rapid set of interest rate cuts you know with twos at 415 they are pricing in very weak uh conditions and a rapid set of cuts in a way that is not necessarily consistent with either the pace that the fed would typically move in an environment where there's you know only modest employment uh shifts uh you know which are likely to stabilize and an environment where inflation certainly remains above uh modestly above their mandate so not really clear what the urgency is for the fed to move uh given the circumstance now does that mean they might cut once they might cut twice through the end of the year yeah who knows they might do one or the other um you know that's basically what the market pricing is not that it hasn't been that interesting uh for about a quarter now uh but the question more broadly is are we entering an aggressive easing cycle that aggressive easing cycle is what you have to believe will happen actually what you have to believe will happen is that even more the fed will be even more aggressive than what's currently priced into this curve if you're thinking that bond yields at their current rates make a lot of sense coming to bonds not only do you have to believe that the fed will cut faster than six times over the course of the next year uh to be buying bonds today you also have to believe that term premiums in bonds will have to go even more negative than they are right now bonos at 420 uh indicate a negative term premium that's a uh the premium of holding long-term bonds rel relative to cash uh is essentially zero you're getting paid nothing to hold the risk of buying a long-term bond relative to cash right now and so when you think about buying bonds you could get you basically break it into two pieces you could say what's the how is monetary policy going to play out relative to what's priced in remember ma fast cutting cycle currently priced in and then what's the premium i get on uh holding uh long-term duration relative to the cash over the course of the next 10 years that is uh basically at you know at postco or post- crisis lows and the us economy today is very different than where it was in the post crisis era you know the strength of balance sheets uh and uh and the risks of inflation to the upside are all the sorts of things that are meaningfully different than where we were just after the financial crisis you know as a person who traded through the financial crisis and and afterwards you know the the macroeconomic conditions today couldn't be more different than where we were in say uh 09 10 11 12 etc and the term premium on bonds is the same today as it was back then and that doesn't make a whole heck of a lot of sense um that particularly doesn't make sense in the context of the continued supply dynamics uh which will be in place while the fed has slowed its uh qe or sorry slowed its pace of qt uh in you know through the through the rest of the year uh notably what has entirely offset that is the fact that the deficit is coming in larger than expected so now we're starting to see a deficit based upon the june 2024 forecast which is likely to be you know oneish maybe a little bit more percent bigger as a percent of gdp than was expected before this is very important from a bond supply dynamic even if the deficit had stayed stable there would have continued to be a substantial amount of bond supply duration supply into the market but the primary determinant of whether that will change and whether it'll pick up uh will be a function of the overall deficit they said that in the last qra that it's likely to be stable unless the deficit is larger well the deficit is going to be larger and the bond is issuance is likely to be larger as a function of that we'll learn about the treasury financing plans a little bit later uh this month uh but odds are given the restate of the b us government budget deficit that's likely to be substantial and look we could talk about this quarter or that quarter or the next quarter but the big picture is with debt levels the way that they are and with uh issuance the way it's going to be basically no matter uh what ends up happening we're going to continue to see a massive supply of borrowing come into the market by the government and that con constant flow of borrowing is going to continue to put pressure on uh on the yield structure and so you know eventually uh the deficits will not be you know lenders will no longer accept a zero term premium environment in order to continue to be buying that debt in addition uh when you think about the risks of how that might change ahead and particularly how the markets might perceive those risks it's very important uh to uh to think about um a new administration or or the or the continuation of the existing administration in the context of how much of you know whether their administration will exist with split government or with uh with government with with a a part holding all the houses and increasingly as a function of uh the political machinations uh it looks like the probability that the republicans will hold all three chambers uh is rising relatively substantially this is from a few uh few uh weeks ago at this point you know the presidency is priced in at roughly 60% to the republicans uh the senate uh the newest estimat i was seeing uh before starting this are almost you know in the 80s uh and the house also pricing in the 80s you put that together and you have almost a 40% chance or probability that the republicans will hold all three chambers of congress uh or all three chambers of the legislature and that's very important because what it means is if they're able to do that then they're able to run the policies that they desire rather than uh being constrained by having to work in a uh bilateral way uh and so you know it's not really you know it's still a tossup let's say in terms of at a big picture level in terms of you know whether uh democrats or republicans will be elected uh uh for the presidency for sure um but what we do know is both parties uh and both uh candidates that are currently running have had relatively substantial you know relatively clear track records of running substantial deficits and the odds that we're going to have a bunch of fiscal consolidation come into the market regardless of who is elected um is is pretty low uh and you could see that there uh with a little bit of humor on the right hand side um i think the big question for markets increasingly will be the control of all three chambers by the republicans and if that becomes more clear ahead of the election we could start to see that affect what's going on uh in the asset markets and we saw just the tiniest hint of that in the debate and how bonds traded through the debate uh and you know that could just be the start of the dynamic if it becomes increasingly clear that republicans will control all the chambers at the same time we're seeing uh you know these relatively uh lofty expectations of us growth uh and a significant cutting cycle we're starting to see dollar liquidity start to tighten globally um probably the best way to describe this is financial conditions and financial conditions this always a very very hard thing to to understand but when you think about financial conditions what they really are is the combination of the desire for the private sector to buy assets either through their own income or leverage combined with the public sector meaning central banks buying of assets uh and typically what you see if you look back through time is that um the the uh assets on the edges uh the most speculative assets often are the ones that feel a tightening of uh financial conditions first and often what you'll see when financial conditions are tightening is that it's not just one asset that's being affected that's being driven by some idiosyncratic dynamic what you'll see is a bunch a constellation of assets being uh being dragged down uh all connected to the typical dollar financial conditions cycle and so that's kind of what we're seeing today whether you look at bitcoin uh the yen the yuan um other than today's uh nuance dynamics of a short squeeze in the russell 2k you saw russell 2k underperform meaningfully relative to the uh overall you know the overall cap weighted market you're seeing all these edges of the market uh perform very weakly and what that suggests is that the private sector may be reaching ing its limits in terms of its the amount of leverage it can provide uh across financial assets and that's very interesting because almost always the way this works is the edges get hit first and then slowly butly it comes into the market if we're seeing an environment where expectations are very high the reality is probably much weaker and dollar financial conditions are tightening that's a combination through the second half of the year that is not a particularly good combination for stocks in particular but also challenging for bonds as they have to receive a bunch of liquidity on an ongoing basis as we turn to the rest of the world it's important to recognize that the inflation problem is not dead you know when coming into the year uh it wasn't just the us that was pricing in a fast pace of cuts uh fast pace of cuts was priced in everywhere in the world uh and so far uh not too much has uh has happened in part because this inflation problem has been a bit stickier than most of these central banks uh would have preferred or desired australia seeing an uptick in inflation in their monthly measures canada uh seeing inflation measures higher than expectations uh the uk inflation particularly in the services side uh being undesirably high with wage growth far outpacing productivity growth and then of course in europe where we're seeing serv inflation continue to be elevated so across all of these jurisdictions you know we've gotten some cuts europe and uh and the canadians are you know there there's some cuts that are that are going on um but the question is are we getting a big globally coordinated easing cycle here the answer is like not really uh and to the extent that the bond market pricing in the us but also globally is a function of uh expectations of a big coordinated global easing cycle it's not happening in contrast japan uh continues uh to uh underperform and really japan and china continue to meaningfully underperform rest relative to the rest of the developed world you know japanese inflation has been uh you know has popped up a little bit uh as it did globally but you know it's come down and has been below target for a couple months now growth has been negative uh for most of the last year uh and as a function you know the boj is not doing um we saw you know what was probabilistically an intervention that happened today on the back of the week cpi print very normal for the ministry of finance to come in and uh try and clean up some speculative positions when the market is offside in one direction but even with that we're trading you know at something something like you know 158 159 which is certainly not all that um you know all that strong you know they got uh what a point point and a half out of their intervention and a massive downside surprise in cpi this is not a currency it's not a country that needs tighter monetary policy it's not a currency uh that is likely to see a whole heck of a lot of support and honestly that um pretty benign response to intervention and weak us data uh and a huge us bond move really suggests that you know the downward trend in the end persists and then of course uh we come to china which you know is continuing on the path of uh deflationary uh depression type environment uh without sufficient monetary stimulation and fiscal expansion necessary uh to achieve uh the type of reflation that is been continually hoped for in the west and so um what you see here you know i think summarizes it well if you just look at the trend of demand you see that demand is just very weak relative to the preco trend uh that is the core of the underperformance of the chinese economy uh and the outcomes are largely what you'd expect given that with bon yields probing new lows uh as you know the economy remains very depressed and the stock market basically giving up the vast majority of its gains except for the real intervention that you know the real acute intervention that happened in february and march you know we're basically we're back to you know stock prices where we were at the beginning of the year so so much for you know round three or maybe it's four of the chinese reflation with that uh off to some audience questions let's um let's hit a few questions that were submitted if if folks have questions that they want to get answered drop them into the uh the q&a uh question bar and we can uh take a look at them um one question here is this is uh from uh the presubmit questions um is whether or not uh we're seeing uh economic growth expand uh globally whether we're seeing any pickup globally i the answer there is that there aren't a lot of signs that we're seeing strong growth or an acceleration of growth globally um what we're seeing instead um is maybe that growth isn't decelerating nearly as fast as people expected in certain jurisdictions like for instance in either the uk or in europe you know growth is not quite as weak uh as many had suspected uh as a function of monetary policy but if you look at places like japan and china growth is very soft uh in comparison to sort of their long-term underlying trend uh growth conditions and so you know i' i'd overall say we're kind of we're kind of at this sort of classic late cycle um slowly slow growing uh environment pretty much globally the real differences are where strong growth is priced in like in the us and where strong growth is less priced in uh in other jurisdictions um another question here is is this an ai fueled stock market bubble um i think that's you know i think a lot of commentators particularly those folks who are trying to explain why they might have missed uh the strength in stocks over the course of the first part of the year will blame it on the ai story and i think as a macro investor um very often you know i look at the i look at the market as a as a whole and look at stocks and bonds and other assets in the context of how conditions transpire relative uh to what's priced in for growth and inflation and if you look at it from that perspective what's transpired in the first half is totally consistent with those dynamics um totally consistent with the dynamics of uh of growth coming in stronger than expectation um and so i i think you can get lost in the specifics of the underlying companies and lose track of the fact that something like three4 of the uh you know two-thirds or three4 of the price expansion that we've seen uh across the us stock market over the course of the first half of the year was driven by things that had you know that were not ai related or the mag seven or whatever you want to call it and so i think there is much more a macro story than it is a micro story related to a small handful of stocks it's just by definition a cap weighted index uh is likely to see the largest cap stocks outperform as a function of uh the shifts in the overall stock market uh another question here about um you know if uh if both candidates are likely to are interested in juicing uh the economy in 2025 what's the likely impact of the bond market there are i'd say is um odds are uh whether or not a candidate uh or an administration is able to juice the market uh at their whim really comes down to whether they control uh the chambers of government and if they do uh then uh you know if if government is divided then they'll be constrained and if it's not divided they'll have the ability to pursue more expansionary policies and so um probably in subsequent uh webinars we'll get into the details of what the differences in the policies are particularly as we start to get closer to um to understanding who is likely to win and what their policies are um though what i' highlight on this is it might get start to get priced into the market particularly sort of an aggregate related to overall deficit numbers and and how bonds might be positioned um but the nuances of the policies like there's no reason to be wildly speculating on that right now uh it'll take time to figure out exactly what the policies are and then how exactly they'll be implemented and so i probably wouldn't try and get too far ahead of that um we'll learn through time and get a a finer sense as to what's going on in terms of uh in terms of their view uh turning to some of the questions that folks have asked here uh today which um one of the questions here is about what chinese policy makers are doing to deal with their uh gdp problem and the main thing i would emphasize there is not much um and this is a very normal dynamic uh if you look at countries facing deflationary depression environments and when i say depression i don't mean you know that unemployment is 50% or that you know the economy is contracting at a 10% rate i'm just saying that's a dynamic there's too much debt a depression dynamic depression dynamic is one in which there's too much debt uh not enough income to service that debt not enough demand uh to grow the economy and deflationary pressures in place i think that's the sort of dynamic that we have in place the way that gets defeated is through significant monetary stimulation and significant fiscal expansion and um i'll i'll you know the exact reasoning behind chinese policymakers decisions is a bit above my pay grade what i would say is that um you could just look at their policies and the steps that they've taken so far in order to address the problems that they have for instance the housing market problem um they could and in fact actually did if you go back to the asian financial crisis set up an infrastructure to deal with bad loans associated with both corporations as well as the housing market um they could deal with this problem very very easily they could take the bad loans off the banks they could put them into an amc they could inject liquidity and equity into the banks in the same way that the us did in the global financial crisis and we could you know we could basically you know they could clean up the banks clean up the loans uh and you know provide fiscal support to uh to households related to the housing market through the form of you know some sort of check or stimulus related to buying houses um or lower interest rates as a function of that those are all you know those are all measures that could be taken place and instead what they're doing is they're trying to deal with sentiment issues right they think it's a problem of sentiment this is totally normal if you go back to the us in the financial crisis if you live through it that summer of 2008 these were all it was all conversations about sentiment oh the sentiment is not good enough oh we have a sentiment problem the problem was not sentiment in the us financial crisis the problem was the banks were broke uh and if the banks are broke there's a way to deal with that through liquidity and capital and the problem in china is that the policy makers uh for whatever reason have not recognized that this isn't a sentiment issue that can just sort of be changed by buying a few stocks or announcing policies that you know represent something like a tenth of a percent of the housing market you know they they haven't recognized that it's actually a fundamental capital and liquidity problem until they do and take the steps necessary not much is going to change in china um i think there's a general question uh there's a question here about sort of the pow positioning around doish pal doish um and what i'd emphasize on that is that um is that you know policy makers respond to data uh and they respond particularly slowly to data in consensus driven organizations unless there's an acute shock situation going on um and while paul has been doish in speech over the course really of the last year plus policy hasn't been doish a policy has been relatively consistent um and so what i'd emphasize is just because there is dovish rhetoric does not mean that there's doish policy uh particularly you know policy will be driven by those underlying fundamentals and when you see a circumstance here which is that you know the labor market has softened a little bit significantly supported by supply and inflation has moderated uh a little bit but still remains modestly above their mandate that is the input that's going to drive their decision- making and neither of those inputs suggest rapid cuts and anywhere near as rapid cuts as what's currently priced into the short rate market and so um i wouldn't get so worried about his language uh if anything you actually probably be better off just not listening to him or any of the fed governors uh and be better off just looking at the data and thinking what's likely to transpire uh in the data um and i'll wrap up with this with this question which i think is an interesting one which is some analysts are saying liquidity will be pretty good throughout 2024 will that be enough to overcome some of the economic slowness um i i think i'd probably address that in in two ways um the first is to highlight that um that liquidity does not mean economic outcomes and part of the challenge that exists today uh and that the fed might actually face in a downturn environment is that um is that there isn't a lot of transmission between uh what how policy is shifting and what's actually transpiring with economic conditions uh and when i say that what i mean is that you know we've had a heck of a tightening and we've had interest rates at this level for two two and a half years give or t and nonetheless you know nominal gdp has been in the same ballpark five or six perc um closer to five more recently uh and we've had a modest slowing uh but the big picture story here is that basically monetary policy has not meaningfully influenced economic conditions very slowly influenced economic conditions here and certainly the moderation that we've seen in inflation the vast majority of that has been a function of uh the resolution of supply chains um and the fall in oil prices neither of which the federal reserve had any control over much less so than uh you know much more so than any shifts in demand that were a function of fed policy shifts and so when you look at that condition even if the fed sort of even the fed eas once or twice like what's the impact on economic conditions i think it'll be quite muted i think the real challenge is if we start to get a self-reinforcing downward dynamic i think the fed is going to be very challenged to drag the economy back up and stimulate uh but that's a story for another day we're not there yet um right now their influence on liquidity conditions is pretty pretty modest and so if you look at the overall picture interest rates are likely to remain pretty elevated um balance sheets you know asset holders have extended their balance sheets to buy assets about as much as they possibly can for instance if you look at things like mutual fund cash holdings and things like that they're basically at secular lows multi-deck lows um so where's the liquidity going to come from that uh it's unlikely the fed is going to provide it on the balance sheet side where the balance sheet is continuing to contract uh the the government isn't going to pay down isn't going to spend down the tga they've made it very clear it's going to be 800 billion through the end of the year like where there isn't there aren't good signs of liquidity that are coming there's di minimus central bank easing and a private sector that remains relatively extended and and struggling to to extend liquidity even farther and that's why i see when you look at those market dynamics those edges of the market that's where you start to see the edges of whether the liquidity pullback the financial conditions pullback is starting to affect other assets and the big picture is it looks like we're kind of reaching uh the the edges uh about as far as we can go um and you know today's market action you don't want to get too cute about today's market action or look too much into it uh so i'll leave it at that thank you so much for taking some time uh it's sticking around a little bit longer uh for this month's macro uh webinar you so much for taking the time and for all the great questions and uh look forward to seeing everybody next month
Credit Driven vs Income Driven Expansions,2024-07-15 04:00:27+00:00,8,e7_N4iKT4J4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7_N4iKT4J4,so all of this brings up the the idea between the differences of a credit- driven economic expansion and an income driven economic expansion so can you lay out the the main differences between the two for listeners yeah i mean most of us have only experienced credit driven uh economic expansions and so when you think about a credit driven economic expansion what that means is someone is borrowing uh you know from a bank uh you know or other borrow you know other source of uh of lending and they're using that money to supplement their income and increase their spending or investment and so like you know the classic one is like the housing bubble right which is you know b a lot of people borrowed a lot of money and bought a lot of houses and there was a fair amount of economic activity associated with that um as one might expect and the the trouble with that with the with the um the borrowing driven expansion is that there are limits to the amount of credit that can be taken uh on by uh you know a household or a business um in particular related to their cash flows and like if you look at the you know us housing bubble like you know first we had 80 ltv loan loans and then we had 100 ltv loans and then we started paying people to take on loans right in order and then and then eventually we got to the point where we've like exhausted every we found every borrower in america who could take a you know take a loan and we saddled them with incredible amounts of debt and we were like okay well then like what else can be done and the answer is not a whole heck of a lot right and so that's when the you know in some ways you know debt cycles exhaust themselves because at some point you basically have lent to all the creditworthy borrowers and often then some and at some point you simply there are no other borrowers that you can plausibly lend to plus the balance sheets of lenders start to become uh constrained and that combined with an interest rate tightening creates a downturn so what that highlights is a credit cycle creates unsustainable buildup creates an unsustainable buildup of liabilities and credit that can't continue for forever now income different driven cycle is very very different um because it doesn't create those unsustainable imbalances and and to make that cycle um to to simplify that cycle basically imagine you know there's just you and i and uh and what happens is you know i i paint your your house and you give me $100 and uh i take that $100 and you know give it to you uh and say hey can you m my lawn you know just that simple both of us have engaged in economic activity the painting and the and the lawn mowing both of us have more income right because what happens is you know you i got $100 you got $100 right and both of us um you know both of us have improved our you know have gotten a real real benefit right you got a painted house and i got a m ball on um and what is the what is the wake of that there's no wake of there's no unsustainable buildup you know we we we just sit you know you have the $100 in your pocket that you had at the start of it and nothing else right and we have a mode lawn and a painted house and we're feeling good about ourselves and so that's the that's the way a income driven cycle works and that can happen in a very sustainable way and it can happen you know for an extended period of time just think about that like that cycle that just described and of course that's a toy example but it kind of gives you a sense as to kind of how it works like often people will say well you know you have to have a let's say an inflationary spiral it's like there's no inflationary spiral here it's just like you know i paint your house you you mow the lawn and we and that's what we do and then theoretically we could just do it the next year and the next year and the next year no problem right and you know maybe we do something a little bit better than what we did the previous year and that's what growth is right and that's basically how that cycle can persist and so you need in that sort of environment because it doesn't have that natural you know two two important points one interest rates in what i just described could be a th% or they could be zero and it would have actually no effect on on this transaction between you and i no impact because nobody's using credit because no one's using credit yeah it doesn't matter now of course that's a little you know it's obviously overly stylized um but it kind of gives you a sense in in um in economies with very underdeveloped credit systems this is actually very you know this is basically how economies expand and contract and what ends up creating the eventual downturn is um is either an exogenous activity you know an exogenous force like co or something like that that causes us to stay in our homes and not bruce economic activity or what starts to happen is we start to invest a little bit too much on expectations that will continue to grow that don't become realized and then eventually we slow down that investment because one of the things that could happen is as i you know paint your house and get the $100 i could go invest in more painting equipment and things like that which has its own gdp effect and if i don't actually see the end demand that comes in the next year in the next year and the next year i may slow my investment and of course you know you spend the $100 at the hardware store and the hardware store gets the money etc etc and so that's often how those cycles work but you need something exogenous there has to be something different that's coming from outside than just the actual transaction to slow that sort of economic expansion so does a or or can a credit driven growth cycle lead to an income driven cycle as wages catch up to this this new amount of credit in the system yeah it's it's an interesting question and and i think one in which um uh if you sort of go uh if you go back through like us cycle back in the 50s and 60s what you had was a mostly income driven cycle but the uh let's say the turns were supported by credit in the sense of you know when you had a decline in interest rates you had people looking at that and saying well i can borrow a little bit and engage in some economic activity uh you know borrow to buy a car or something like that you know to engage in a in a capital transaction and that of creates a bit of a spark which then starts to create you know someone sells you the car that's their income they take that income they spend it etc and it goes through the economy and so in in in in some previous cycles in sort of oldtime cycles you had modest shifts in debt creating that income generation but it was really the income expansion that was the big driver you know once that sort of uh spark happened in the economy um which is different from you know i think as you got to something where like the 2008 cycle that was a cycle where essentially all the volatility of economic activity was driven by marginal borrowing um in one form or another and so you know we transitioned uh you know it doesn't mean that there's no income because obviously people have income but um the question is more what drives the the volatility rather than what drives you know the absolute level of of spending
How to Evaluate Asset Managers?,2024-07-12 12:15:04+00:00,4,WI-CtkYnaa0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI-CtkYnaa0,so bob what do you think is a good let's say a good benchmark to measure against when evaluating those managers in these different economic climates yeah well i i think of course um you want to think about uh you want to think about their risk return uh you know the amount of return that you're seeing relative to the amount of risk that's being taken and you want to see the amount the type of risk that's being taken in the context of essentially a only portfolio whether it's stocks only or 6040 and so um and so when you think about you know something like the risk versus return i think it's actually a very interesting one because um some of the things that you can see in that um are uh whether someone is basically just has outsized returns as a function of outsized risk-taking um which creates concerns that maybe you know if uh the market went against whatever their bias is they could experience substan losses um what it also tells you is the plausibility that the returns that have been observed will likely continue there's a lot of people both in back tests but also in reported returns that may tell you that they have you know uh very very extremely good uh risk return ratios uh you know return risk return ratio sharp ratios of two or three or five such uh returns relative to risk are unlikely to be persistent over long periods of time and may actually too good an outcome may reflect uh too much luck being a driver or in the extreme may raise questions about the validity of the return profile that you're seeing either in reported returns or a back test and so you you want to it's almost like what you want to do on the risk return thing is you want someone who has a uh who's giving you a plausible risk return not someone who's giving you a bad one or a particularly good one um and then on correlation you know it's just simply a question of um you know when you're building your whole portfolio obviously the more that someone is simply taking risk that otherwise exists in your portfolio so you know for instance if you're uh you know have a lot of equity beta you you may not actually want that because you're like look i got plenty of equity beta i don't need to pay for it's free let me just you know buy spy or vti or something like that um versus you know managers that have lower correlation to the assets that are current that are already in your portfolio i think the key trade-off there is that um you have to understand that there's a trade-off between those two things which is that often to get lower correlation you actually have to have worse risk relative to or return relative to risk and that when you start to see people say i have essentially a zero correlation and i have outside sharp ratios that should raise questions about the plausibility of that strategy uh and whether it is likely to achieve those sorts of outcomes that are at least being pitched to to folks
What Drives GDP?,2024-07-11 12:15:03+00:00,5,jAFn8hcBPPo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAFn8hcBPPo,let's let's think about gdp the way that gdp is aggregated you have um uh investment consumption net exports uh and government spending um would you agree with the premise that uh if you were to break down the categories of gdp that the investment component of gdp uh typically is more of a leading element than the consumption part of gdp as is traditional across business cycle is that is that roughly fair to say specifically because you have the residential component that's very sensitive and business equipment investment um and and if you do agree with that um you know why is your focus not a little bit more on the components that uh lead or feed into business investment as opposed to uh income and consumption well i think there is um there is a difference in terms of um household uh demand and uh and cons household consumption elements i think in many ways are um are the most leading of the indicators and when i say that what i mean is like real estate investment as well as you know uh various um you know large ticket items let's say right which is that consumption or investment you know i i think about more as an investment durables i think about as more of an investment like a car is like classically a consumption item but i think about it more as consumption but right right but it's actually a a large large purchase that is being meaningfully influenced by um agree yeah by uh by the changes in interest rates and financial conditions etc and so when when i'm thinking about that dynamic i'm very focused on very focused on how residential uh demand is flowing through uh or or household demand and investment is flowing through because that really is almost always the leading edge of the cycle how that evolves is very important um and i think if you go back through cycles many cycles i think you probably agree that you know uh household consumption demand is a big a big driver um i think the business side of it is more like something that enhances ay a cyclic dynamic much more so than it is the primary driver so enhancing meaning has meaningful impact very big impact there's a lot of business fixed investment it can drive gdp significantly but it's more it more picks up as a as a a consequence of increased demand from particularly the household sector more so than it is something that um is an independent set of activities that is an independent driver and and part of the way i would sort of resolve that and i um i would i would sort of assess that is to say if interest rates fall which obviously changes find financing conditions what's the first thing to react the first thing to react is residential fixed investment and auto purchases right and washing machines and stuff like that right that's the stuff that first reacts and then eventually you get more business fix investment when the household investment and consumption picks up that then creates and when labor markets start to pick up and then once uh once you get enough demand so that you know it makes sense to do incremental advs right now i think i think you're spot on in in my study of business cycles going back you know to to the 60s there are basically three narrow categories of gdp or three narrow categories of the economy that drive all the cyclical es and flows right we have residential investment we have as you mentioned durable goods consumption and we have business equipment investment uh which is a narrow component of a larger category of investment those those three categories um but to your point the only recession um to to my you know way of of of looking at it where business equipment investment was the driver was the 2000s recession yeah yeah yeah that was a big because the and the boom and credit was really in the business investment side part hangover from uh um you know information technology and things like that
"Financial Market Liquidity, What is it and Why Does it Matter?",2024-07-10 12:15:00+00:00,6,20S7WhwuzfE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20S7WhwuzfE,you mentioned on twitter recently i think it was this week or maybe last week that you're noticing uh financial market liquidity is turning you referenced a couple of currency pairs that are popular with more of the trading community for signaling inflections in financial market liquidity or or um you know economic growth uh so tell me what you're seeing there why is financial market liquidity turning and what does it mean for the fed for the economy and for let's say risk assets yeah when you're thinking about financial markets um there is um the steps that central banks take to you know uh tighten or ease liquidity conditions um in monetary policy and interest rates and then there is uh somewhat necessarily a private sector response to that set of conditions and all the other things that are going on and so if you've sort of um you sort of been around the business long enough you sort of get this feel of you know when uh a combination of central bank behaviors plus what the private sector is willing to do um if that is picking up uh you more positive you could say more positive uh let's say um financing conditions or financial conditions you know i liquidity is confusing because i think there's like people have specific definition of liquidity which i don't want buzz yeah it's kind of a buzz word i kind of think about it like if you just take the effect on financial conditions from what the central banks are doing and what the private sector is doing and you put those two things together when that is expanding certain you know that the money the money and credit essentially flows to corners uh sort of the outer edges of the market and those assets do particularly well so you know bitcoin or high yield spread or uh really uh high beta emerging markets right those are sort of the corners that you see do well when that's expanding and then when it's contracting those corners of the market uh don't do well right they're the first ones to feel a bit of the tightening effects of financial conditions whereas sometimes you actually see the core of risky assets do well because capital is moving from the riskiest to the core right so you might see the s&p 500 like if you go back as an example in the in the in the financial crisis days like you actually saw like the us kind of you know kind of do well sort of core of the us do well even though the sort of periphery of the global financial market started to show some tremors during that period and so all the way through the first quarter of 08 yeah exactly exactly right through the first quarter of 08 even though like you know we were on the cusp of the greatest financial crisis in 100 years right you know and so uh i don't think i'm not claiming that we're gonna have a repeat of that um i almost got you i almost got you you almost got me to say it but not quite and and in these circumstances if you've been through these circumstances before what will end up happening is people will look at this thing and that thing and that that other thing and they'll say oh that's idiosyncratic because of an election in mexico and that's idiosyncratic because you know china's data is a bit soft and they're implementing some housing po and that you know and and what people will do is all of them will say there's some idiosyncratic thing going on in all these things but when you look across all of them if you're sort of seeing it show up everywhere it tells you there's something bigger a foot than a bunch of idiosyncratic things and i think that's what we're seeing you know um i i don't as a you know a simple example like i don't trade bitcoin as an asset i don't understand it well enough to feel like i have alpha to generate in it but um i think there's a lot of smart people who have worked on it who connect its movements to uh liquidity dynamics um in sort of the same way that i think about liquidity dynamics and you're seeing those assets sell off you're seeing like the riskiest coins sell off you're seeing bitcoin sell off you're seeing emerging markets sell off you're seeing continued pressure on the yen um you know you're seeing the crappier stocks in the us index you know fall despite the fact the s&p 500 is is rising like those are all indications that this set of financial conditions is starting to constrict and that if the chinese currency is going down and the yen's going down and and bitcoin's going down it doesn't really matter for the economy but if that starts to affect the core like the s&p 500 then that can have a meaningful impact on the wealth effect you know balance sheets etc and that can create a more significant dynamic and so you know it's could it just be quarter-end you know balance sheet cleanup which you know you always have to be careful about that often happens um or is it just that things are a little thinner with you know these two weeks with you know the holiday last week and the holiday next week that we're kind of seeing where the sort of cracks are in the in the global financial conditions story you know i'm 5050 but it certainly um everything is not hunky dory here um and you know tales of stocks going to you know astronomical heights certainly is not aligned with the sort of tightening of financial conditions that we're seeing uh across financial markets today
"Jobs, Earnings Expectations and Risk Assets",2024-07-09 12:15:04+00:00,4,xIhsI3bHyuk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIhsI3bHyuk,"if if you look at like adp as an example which is uh gives you a real sense into the private sector that's mostly been flat about 150,000 jobs for over the course of the last year and so uh you know that is good enough uh to keep uh a tight enough labor market to cause some concern for the fed but probably not good enough uh to feel good about you know the consumer going out there and spending aggressively week from now week from today we start getting those earnings reports from the banks jp morgan's typically first we saw the k struggle today right how do the expectations look versus the reality that you think we're likely to get from the bank earnings reports and how should investors position based on that well i think the financials are one of the places where there's this disconnect between the strength of expectations and maybe the reality of what it's looking at you're looking at earnings growth expected in 24 there of something like you know mid uh double digit earnings growth uh if you look back over the last year it's been in the low single digits uh you have an environment uh like you know growth that we have plus some creeping up credit problems that is emerging and and particularly you see the regionals start to face that first because they don't have you know big diversified uh businesses in in terms of you know uh trading activities and things like that the way the the the mega cap banks do and so they're the ones really in the crosshairs if they can't get relief from the fed and they start to see a slowing economy and some uh some issues related to credit concerns you put that together that's not a great tactical picture for the regionals so let me ask that about uh crypto and the overall risk picture the nasdaq overall had a very strong week right but we saw particularly this morning bitcoin di below that 55,000 level that we've been hearing is critical for it is there any other indication that you're seeing in the markets that there's hesitation around risk assets yeah i think if if if you've been around the markets long enough you you see sort of the the edges of markets often start to get hit first before sort of the core starts to feel any tightening of financial conditions and i think what we're seeing is that's happening it's not just bitcoin although bitcoin is often one of the most sensitive to tightening financial conditions we're also seeing that for instance in the dollar and how it's trading against the yen or the chinese uan or the brazilian real we're seeing it in russell relative to nasdaq um so we're seeing nvidia was one of the weaker mega caps today that's right which which obviously had benefited a lot from uh a lot of interest uh and and and easier financial conditions over the course of the second quarter and so you're sort of seeing you know any one of these things we could talk about bitcoin specifics or chinese yuan specifics or yen specifics but you put you put the whole picture together it looks like uh dollar financial conditions are starting to tighten and you know the s&p 500 or the nasdaq can only stay uh buoyant relative to those broader tightening financial conditions for so long"
"Why is the Fed in a ""Do Nothing"" Mode? (In July 2024)",2024-07-08 12:15:00+00:00,8,08q8lWEhOJ0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08q8lWEhOJ0,what is your current view on where the fed is with inflation um how is fed policy uh in relation to how they're doing with inflation uh and how does that stack up or how would you uh view the opportunity in the context of what looks to be a consensus pricing of about let's call it one and a half to two cuts by the end of this year at this point i mean the fed is basically dealing with inflation that's still a little bit elevated relative to their mandate and a modestly slowing economy that is not you know that is still secularly tight from you know if if you zoom out on any with any perspective um you know a 4% unemployment rate is still very low and so the balance of those things are um are leading a po leading to a policy behavior where they're not doing much right and i think it's easy to like get hung up on all the rhetoric and the speakers and press conferences and all that stuff and just forget like it's been six months this year and they have done nothing they did nothing in the second half of last year like nothing the answer is nothing what has the fed done nothing and part of the reason why that is is because that is a uh reasonable policy for them to do nothing in the context of that balance of pressures pretty good you know overall an economy that's pretty good with inflation that's a little too high and so the thing that's going to force them to change that stance is something's gonna either have to happen meaningfully with inflation meaning it's gonna have to go up a lot which is you know i don't think there's anything nothing i see that is other than an absent like a meaningful oil price shock or something like that i don't really see anything pressuring it that way or the economies has to slow down meaningfully and i also don't see anything acute in that term you i think we're going to see continued gra ual moderation but nothing that is you know the economy falling off the cliff and so you put that together and it kind of gives the picture that um the fed's going to do nothing right that that's basically where their stance is is in a do nothing policy stance for extended period and like finally markets know we came into this year just talk about expectations markets were pricing in seven cuts seven cuts in an economy with an under 4% unemployment rate and inflation that was you know 100 or 200 basis points above the fed's mandate like that was crazy that was crazy pricing now pricing is one cut like i don't know are they gonna cut once they gonna cut zero they're gonna cut two like it you know in in the game of trading markets you don't want to like get too hung up on you don't want to play a game with one cut or two cuts or this or that because you have no idea at that no one has any idea at that level so when you say the economy i agree with you by the way on inflation in the sense that it's clearly above target uh there's nothing in my view that would indicate that inflation is going to meaningfully accelerate most of the residual inflation pressure if you look at the subcomponents is from of course uh rent oar shelter uh and motor vehicle uh insurance those two components i believe are responsible for about 65% of total inflation um motor vehicle insurance will will of course you know just based on comps roll down shelter of course is anyone's guess how slowly that that normalizes um however the fed historically has never really cut based on inflation they almost always cut based on employment because in the sequence of business cycles inflation generally lags employment right inflation would be characterized as more lagging economic indicator employment more coincident um unemployment rate as you mentioned is 4% however um on the margin it's gone from 34 to four right so the trajectory is upwards how do you square um you know it's a low unemployment rate quote unquote low based on history verse it's a rising unemployment rate and uh i'm sure you're familiar with the the phrase slowly than all at once right so so what do you what do you um you know how do you sort of get a a leading edge on the risk that employment uh moves to 4.2 over the next three or four months let's say and then all of a sudden we're dealing with a 100 basis point increase off the lows which in a historical context would trigger things like maybe the su rule and be more consistent with every recession we've had in the past so how square it's low as a general comment versus it's a rising unemployment rate i think it really comes down to what is causing the rise and if you see um and i think this this uh period is at least somewhat interesting that part of that rise is supply oriented um and so for instance if you see where do you see loosening you see uh more loosening in high school or less education more loosening in um in lower income or younger cohorts and so you look at that and you sort of say to yourself you know and that's at a time so that's happened at a time when we've had a pickup an immigration uh you know pretty meaningful pickup in immigration um and flow and uh where labor force participation uh you know for prime age workers is basically at you know multi-decade highs i sort of look at that picture and i say to myself you know if you're sitting in the fed shoes that's kind of a desirable uh loosening modest loosening of the labor market and one where you're not necessarily seeing the types of dynamics that would become reinforcing right just because more um you know more prime aed women are coming into the workforce and that's drawing the unemployment rate down or just because immigration is increasing and that that's creating a loosening of the of the labor markets i'm not sure if you're sitting in the fed shoes you say that that's a real problem the problem comes when you get uh a real you know you get a real slowing in hing where you and then on top of it where you get a big pickup in firings right firings are at you know are very low you know basically they're as low as the jolt series as been since it started in 2002 um in as a percentage of the population or or the labor force um you know high rings have slowed but they're you know they're still fine you know in the scheme of things and coming off of incre incredibly high high ring that happened a couple years ago and participation very high like that that's kind of that's kind of an optimal slowing of loosening it's probably an optimal loosening of the labor market rather than

How to Evaluate an Economy,2024-07-05 12:15:00+00:00,5,ATFjOzsUWLI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATFjOzsUWLI,uh but maybe just take everyone through uh your overall framework how you approach an economy how you triangulate data what indicators do we use how do you bucket them what's most important to you all the things like that yeah yeah i i think um uh i i think for me it really does start with thinking about um when you're thinking about a an economy thinking about um the the the money the credit and the income that uh that is being used for spending both for households and for businesses and then usually governments are not a proactive driver although of course the federal government in the us case has been more of a proactive driver recently um and so start with that set of concepts essentially think about the cash flow statement of households businesses and to some extent governments and from there think through you know try and understand and in particular what is the income that they're getting how much borrowing are they going to do you know essentially what money is being uh put into the economy and then from there what are they likely to do with that set of cash flows that they have available and what they choose to do with the set of cash flows that they have available is depend upon a lot of different stuff in terms of um you know what's happening with asset prices what's happening you know with uh interest rates what's happening with their job prospects etc and that leads to an understanding of what's going to happen with their demand and investment and then you know you basically take your household demand and investment your business demand and investment and your federal government or your government demand and investment plus foreigners of course and that basically tells you what's happening in the economy and so data points are just little lenses into each one of those different pieces to understand how those things are likely to transpire ahead of us right they're just telling you sort of today what's going on with all those different things and then you have to start to think about okay well what caused the dynamics that we're seeing and then what are the set of pressures on those dynamics that will then cause the behavior to change into the future and so that's that's kind of and so that whole that whole ecosystem then is meaningfully influenced by a couple of different things one is that it's influenced by what's going on in the financial markets you know you can think about all the different places borrowing is influenced by you know asset returns and credit and you know and and what's going on with interest rates um you know desires spend versus save is a function of asset returns interest rates etc so each one of those pieces are affected by asset markets or private the private sector asset markets and then also affected by monetary policy which essentially you know it's just a way in which the economy gets manipulated but of course it's recursive in the sense of of the outcomes then influence the policy which then influen the dynamics all of that you want to put that into a context all that helps you build a forward-looking picture of what's likely to transpire in the economy when you're trading financial markets which it's a little bit different because you're not you're less focused on literally trading the bond market and the stock market and stuff like that but when you're trading financial markets then you have to take that forward-looking understanding of what you think is going to happen in the economy and compare it to what's priced into asset markets which all too often people talk about what's going to happen and don't talk about what's priced in because what's priced in is what you're trading when you're trading financial markets and it's it's often forgotten it's almost always forgotten doesn't get it do way which is kind of funny because it's the easy thing to do right you can figure out what's priced in for monetary policy like you go look at the curve so you want to compare those two things and what that creates is opportunities in the financial market where there's meaningful divergence between what's likely to transpire what's priced in and that creates the opportunities for alpha so that's kind of the that's probably um yeah hopefully that's an understandable cogent sense of what i'm trying to do on a day-to-day basis no it's it's very clear it gives me a lot of breadcrumbs to feed off of we're
How does a Strong U S  Dollar Impact Central Banks and Foreign Countries,2024-07-04 12:15:04+00:00,5,kFTOjyuDRnI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFTOjyuDRnI,places that are notably weak is you know japan is notably weak with uh negative gdp growth a couple of negative gdp growth prints canada is weak with near zero or slightly above zero growth in an environment where they have relatively significant labor force growth and of course china has been stagnant for multiple years you also have a lot of other currencies weak against the dollar the dollar index has been relatively strong it's at 104.3 when recording this interview but you have a lot of other currencies i would say that are very very weak against the dollar especially like the japanese yen but there's a lot of emerging market currencies the last six months that have been very weak against the dollar too yeah well i think that really highlights the divergence um of what's going on uh economically i mean look look the us is outperforming essentially every other major developed economy um and as a function of that is in a position where uh the us needs to maintain tighter monetary policy for an extended period of time relative to places you know place like japan which you know has inflation that's below their target you know back below their target and negative gdp growth which is likely going to have you know very weak growth for you know very weak uh or stimulative monetary policy for an extended period of time so those circumstances are are firmly in place and are putting pressure on exchange rates mostly for the dollar to be stronger relative to the rest of the world and from the us perspective there's not really much consequence of a strong dollar you know on the margin it's uh detrimental to exports but you know that is a very marginal effect you know if you're if you're sitting in the fed shoes you don't really it doesn't really matter if the dollar continues to strengthen because us monetary policy remains tight relative to the rest of the world domestic economic strength and the need to have tight monetary policy uh continue matters a lot more than uh than any impact from the dollar do you think that these other foreign central banks are they worried about the dollar rallying because they have dollar denominated debt and they have a lot of domestic inflation if their currency is getting weak well i think you know there's a there's a big difference uh between how different economies are looking at it if you're if you're um if you're japan uh where you have very you know very minimal uh foreign currency debt that um uh the decline in the currency isn't really a structural problem on the margin is actually supporting what would otherwise be inflation that's too low um and so it's not clear you there's there's obviously financial stability concerns and you don't want your currency to be plunging and so that's why they intervene every once in a while to sort of take out uh specs who are over levered in short positions but the boj is fine with currency depreciation if anything probably pleased a bit with it it i i'd put that in contrast with what we're seeing out of the pboc where um you know china has some dollar denominated debt that's not really the big problem the big problem for china is that there is significant desire to save in dollars and real channels to be able to do it given the amount of uh trade that's going on and so households and corporations are really desperate uh to move money offshore in one form or another which is putting pressure on their currency uh you know with with everyone recognizing that china needs much more stimulative monetary policy to even get relatively acceptable uh economic growth ahead and so you know people are figuring out ways to prepare for negative pressure on the exchange rate and the pboc is playing playing a bit of whack-a-mole to try and to try and slow that down um and they're not doing it so successfully they've had to intervene massively in order to just keep the currency where it is today
Bills and Bonds,2024-07-03 12:15:00+00:00,4,BOhnajbx1bk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOhnajbx1bk,the fact that we're likely to see money remain tight we're also likely to see a continued flow of significant bond selling uh by uh by the us treasury as a function of the continued elevated deficits the treasury is basically committed to say that they are likely to issue the same uh share of bonds versus bills on the deficit for uh an extended period of time uh and so what you see here is a basic story where the amount of gross issuance total bonds and notes gross issuance you know is likely to remain uh at multi you know at basically secular highs uh in an environment that's very different from that previous high when there was substantial money printing you know we continue to have the fed uh to a modest extent uh roll down the balance sheet or slow the balance sheet and we continue to see this pressure of constant bond sales coming into the market market any one day of course those bond market sales can be absorbed but over a period of time uh in one form or another asset prices need to fall and when i say asset prices i mean aggregate asset prices right so something like an rpar uh you know a balanced portfolio of asset prices needs to fall in one form or another given the constant supply and quantitative tightening that's coming into the market and that's only exacerbated by the fact that the federal reserve continues to run monetary policy that's relatively tight for an extended period of time so given these pressures the real question is basically how do you get the next 10% leg up in either stocks or bonds and i think the story um that that has to be told is pretty challenging it's a pretty challenging uh you know needle to thread in order to get an environment where that that next leg up and asset prices actually occurs um and then the pressure on the us bond market i think is particularly important when you think sort of globally like globally the world is benchmarking off of the us bond market you know basically all assets in one form or another are being benchmarked from it you see there in the upper leand corner the shifts in the bond market you know the up move in april and then the down move and chop over the course of the last six weeks that basically aligns with what you're seeing in terms of the bond market action in the uk you know us conditions are different from that those in the uk yet uk bond yields basically trading on us conditions with slightly less beta you see that in the stock market you know in april the bond yield rise creating a drag on the stock market and then the resolution creating a lift you see that in global commodity prices they're shown with the crb and so you add that all up and you actually see a situation where you know the us bond yield what is transpiring with the us bond yield it becomes the central lever to what's going on with the with the world
Have Passive Index Funds Changed the Market For Stocks?,2024-07-02 12:15:03+00:00,4,RVk3hqWXxdw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVk3hqWXxdw,to the comments that david einhorn has made about how market structure with stocks he he basically called them broken and things have changed a lot in the last 15 or 20 years with passive investing or index funds do you think that uh the stock market there's a permanent bid under it now because of people who in their retirement accounts are basically just dollar cost averaging with their savings if they have like a corporate job that's high paying with these index funds well we've had a big transition from uh defined uh benefit plants to define contribution plans in terms of structural um retirement savings and it's not clear to me that there's there's a huge difference in terms of uh sort of the persistent bid that exists uh in the defined contribution uh plan system relative to what what existed previously pension funds bought stocks and bonds uh you know for decades um just as people are buying them in their 401k and so um you know is it is it possible that that is creating you know a you know is that creating a bid under the market yeah to some extent it is but um i certainly you know the the statement that the um that the markets are broken doesn't align with certainly what i see when it comes to seeing that markets are largely trading in line with uh with the type of of macro economic dynamics that have existed for multiple decades it doesn't mean that they're right or they're you know the consensus expectation is you know where i think markets will go or that there's no alpha it just means that the the basic day-to-day market behavior is still looks pretty normal to me you don't think it's weird though that um a lot of these index funds they end up owning over 40% of the shares outstanding and so they're not like being activist investors getting board seats or um actively trying to manage the um operational controls of the company profit margins things like that they just passively uh own a lot of shares and and they they're controlling what over 40% 50% of the shares of these stocks the other issue i have with the index funds is the market cap waiting it just seems that money indiscriminately goes into the companies that are already big it's not reallocating capital like an active money manager like you or others where they would try to buy low and sell high it just keeps going into the larger and larger market caps yeah people have always invested in index products in one form or another i mean in index futures or the equivalent um when it comes to to oversight um i mean my view has always been that um uh behavior by boards and and shareholders and things like that is not a meaningful influence on uh corporate outcomes um i mean part of that is being a macro investor um and so seeing the world through that macro lens and seeing that the much you know the much bigger driver certainly as you start to think about um stock indices you know stocks in index form maybe any individual stock who you know could be on the margin but in an index level macroeconomic drivers matter a whole heck of a lot more than any individual decisions that are being made by companies themselves or their boards or oversight related to it
How Are Small Cap U S  Companies Doing in June 2024?,2024-07-01 12:15:00+00:00,6,5AL4CwTHnEo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AL4CwTHnEo,so many people will say that the small caps are the true sign of the us economy we've talked about that as well is it is this just a market idea or is it just a market um that without the economy or is it both what are your thoughts on this massive divergence with rti or rty i should say uh the russell 2000 and the nasdaq and s&p well the the nature of a lot of those companies something like 40% of them are negative cash flow businesses puts them at the front end of that decay pay experience of elevated interest rates right because those are businesses that you know at some point you know if you're perpetually loss making business at some point or another you're going to run out of money and you're going to have to go to the financing markets either the equity market to raise more equity or to the debt markets to borrow again and so they are the ent the entities the businesses that are the most sensitive to the structural environment of higher interest rates and so it's not that surprising in like that you're not seeing much relief because for those companies the reality is the level of rates is a you know whether it's 425 or 475 it doesn't really matter what really matters is that they're credit constrained and i'd say those that 40% of companies that's in that index they are unusual in the overall economy and the reason why that is is if you're a small business like a true small business i'm talking about like you know an accounting business you know you know your neighborh hood accounting business those businesses aren't borrowing a ton they run cash flow positive like you have to run cash flow positive you don't have any access to credit so if you're a small small business small entrepreneurial business you're mostly insulated from interest rate rises and obviously if you're a big business you know you have access to the credit markets you've termed out your debt you often have a lot of cash free cash flow etc and so what we're seeing in that index in particular is the sort of the belly of the market that's particularly sensitive to the continuation of elevated interest rates in the economy and it's going to be tough for those businesses to to succeed unless we get a meaningful easing of interest rates without a meaningful deterioration in economic conditions and that's going to be tough that's a tough place to be for a lot of those companies and so ultimately we go back to the fed if the fed cuts once twice or three times that actually will have some impact on what happen happens in those stocks though no yeah i think so the question is for what reason you know if the fed's creating easier monetary policy as a function of let's say inflation coming down right that's great for those companies because it doesn't mean that they're they're not experiencing the growth risk and they're getting the easing of financing conditions the real problem for those companies is can they get the easing of financing conditions without getting a growth slowdown and that's the real challenge and i think we're you know i think the market is sort of staring at that and saying oof that is going to be a tough that's going to be tough to get that combination of events that would be particularly would make those assets you know those those companies particularly attractive i think it's interesting actually i was i was just looking at my day job was looking at how hedge funds are positioned and i was just looking at how hedge funds for today are actually have their lowest allocation their most short position on a relative basis for small caps and midcaps than they've had in 25 years years i think it reflects the challenge that those companies are are facing some would say that's an opportunity right because if you know i always look at you know where not always but if you're going to be in a true bull market and the economy is going to be we go back to having this growth and these earnings that should help these smaller companies you would think or are we just maybe in a scenario where just the big guys are going to do well in this market and it isn't an opportunity russell's continue going to continue to struggle because they just can't compete we're in an environment where they don't play catchup even in a good economy just because really the world's changed yeah and i i think that's where the the sort of people talk about the k-shaped recovery well when it comes to businesses that k-shaped recovery is you know positive cash flowing businesses whether they're big or small do well in this sort of environment and negative cash flow businesses do poorly are those that need a lot of fixed investment right because they need a lot of incremental debt and so that's kind of that's the divergence that's the k-shaped recovery and so it's less about size because as i said like actually if you're a service if you're a service company if you're a small service company actually things are pretty good for you right services demand is quite strong as long as you don't need any debt right you're in pretty good shape and so that's really that that's the k is the financing need versus financing need much less like you know essentially the size cohort it's just happens to be that small companies are also big borrowers
How To View Inflation Changes (and the Impact on Monetary Policy),2024-06-28 12:15:00+00:00,7,33MZUZO_Bvk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33MZUZO_Bvk,"the question is how do you interpret the recent us inflation data and do you see it as an outlier or is this a new trend well we've you know we've certainly gone from a period where inflation was at depending on what measure you're looking at something in the five six s% range to something that's closer to the 2 to three% range that's basically where we're at right now and even though like you know we spend a lot of time like squinting is at like 2.8 or 2.7 or 2.9 or whatever like you know who who cares like at some level it's still a bit elevated it's a little high for the fed's preference you know basically it will remain unless there's some sort of unexpected shock it will likely continue to be elevated relative to the f fed's preference and that elevation is the thing that is an important consideration when it comes to the fed not proactively cutting you know i think we came into 2024 a lot of people were essentially trading off of or keying off of waller's comments that they were going to do a an easing in order to contain real you know in order to bring what was perceived as real rates down and that was essentially in some ways you could look at that like a proactive easing right even though you know the economy didn't deter rate they were going to proactively ease i think the fact that inflation is stabilized here at a level that is a bit above where their target is and the fed's response even the dot plot gave some indication you know shifting to only one cut rather than than two cuts uh you know rather than three cuts in the most recent do plot all points in the direction of like look inflation is a little too high we're not going to proactively ease and so you know expect this monetary policy position that we're going to be in expect it for a long period of time and honestly like you'd be a lot better off just like stop listening to all you know certainly stop listening to the fed and certainly stop listening to those governors like they you know they have no idea what's going on and they certainly have no idea what monetary policy is going to be and so like just you're much better off just not listening to them and just kind of take pencil in the fed it's like it's going to be h you know rates rates will be elevated they're not going to proactively ease unless growth slows and just like and and move on there's other things that are more interesting to be thinking about these days i love that you're saying this bob because i think that for so many traders out there and investors they're trying to read the tea leaves of what the fed is going to do and from watching your posts on x listening to your other interviews hearing today it is not the primary reason the market is moving and doing what it is right now and i think it's so important because traders get so caught up into what is that macro theme what is driving this and you see so many people talking about well the fed's getting ready to cut rates or you know the fed was raising rates we couldn't go higher and and all these things i think really get into their subconscious and it's caused a lot of traders to struggle i think uh because it just it's it's the environment that we've been in for so long and to remove ourselves from that just like it was i remember when we got into where all we watched was the fed i couldn't wait to be out of it it's like that breaking up of your girlfriend or that divorce from that you're like you know i still feel like there's this connection there but do i do i just remove myself from it and so i i want to go to really how you view the current stance of the federal reserve what impact do you think their policies have had on inflation growth and on bond yields um where do you see them in the coming months the fed's actions and and just more generally like monetary policy and the and the repricing of of interest rates in the economy basically we went from a period of very very low interest rates for a long period of time to a period of recognition that hey interest rates are not going to be you know nearly as low as they were in the post gfc period um for a variety of different reasons both the economy has healed and is stronger than it was then as well as the fact that you know we're seeing inflationary pressures and so that created a reset of interest rates but if you really look at it like what have two-year bonds done two-year bond yields done over the course of the last you know two years they've basically been in the same range right reset to a higher level the tenure bond has basically been in the same range you know there's a lot of conversation is at 430 or 475 or whatever but like we were at you know under two and now we're at four to five right and we've basically been in that range and if anything like it's been sort of range bound like you've been better off fading extreme expectations either bond yields particularly high or bond yields particularly low or the fed tightening a lot or not easing at all or versus the fed you know easing a lot like you've been much better off the last twoes years fading those wiggles because there wasn't like there's not a lot of information value in the wiggles um if anything it's just people's expectations that are like flipping around that are much more volatile than the economic reality and the economic reality is we're in a higher interest rate environment you know the economy was very strong two years ago coming out of covid and with very high income growth to households tighter monetary policy and plus the natural sort of meeting the economic you know the the limits the economic capacity uh in the economy has meant now that growth is slowing down modestly and we're sort of seeing the sort of slow decay of the economy you know income growth was at six to seven and then five to six and then four to5 and employment growth was at 500,000 jobs and then you know 300,000 jobs and then 15 50,000 jobs and that sort of decay over the course of years is actually very normal for i'd call it sort of a traditional business cycle like that's how business cycles work which is you know the economy's too hot interest rates rise the economy slows down it takes a while it's kind of death by a thousand cuts rather than some acute moment where it's like oh today we walk in and we're in recession it's not how typical economies work unless there is an external shock like covid or an unusual credit crisis dynamic like we saw in 2008 but neither of those things are well who knows if we'll have another covid i i can't predict that but certainly we're not in a position to have an acute credit crisis shock right now so we're just kind of getting slow but sure decay from elevated interest rates"
"Equity Markets Are Up, What About Earnings?",2024-06-27 12:15:06+00:00,5,ovEi3TXs7RE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovEi3TXs7RE,so it comes down to i think part of the story is is that because expectations were set low and now earnings are coming in and people are increasing their expectations that is why the market has become really just this one-sided rally is it because people are playing catchup because people had expectations too low and now so it's sort of chased just to get in because i have to be in yeah well in part i mean that said if you just look at s&p 500 earrings over the last six quarters six or eight quarters like you're certainly not seeing double digit earnings growth over the last six or eight quarters on the s&p 500 right like if anything actual earnings uh you know have been pretty pretty mediocre over the last year and a half or so and so i think what's happening is that people are extrapolating um that the economy is not going to be terribly weak there's a lot of concerned about the economy being terribly weak resetting their expectations to being strong and extrapolating growth that's happened that's uh price growth like return positive strong returns that predominantly come from not from earnings growth but from resetting multiples m you know multiples going higher and they're then extrapolating that into saying well because those multiples essentially have gone higher then what we're now going to see is we're actually going to see the earnings that match the multiples that we're seeing and of course there are certain companies where that's happened like you know in nvidia has actually gotten at least reported earnings that are not that far off of what those multiples were in terms of uh in terms of what's going on but you know that that's few and far between in aggregate the s&p 500 the earnings growth situation is basically flat for the last 18 months and multiples have been driving the expansion and now people are saying that you know it's going to be earnings in the future you know it's pretty hard to see from a macro perspective how it adds up so does it worry you that the market is being led by just a handful of stocks well i i think from a macro perspective as a macro investor essentially there's always winners and losers in a stock market and and so i think you get caught up in oh is this just a nvidia story or just a this story or just a that story like when it comes to an equity market you know there's always going to be people on the right side of tail left side of the tail that's the way it works it is more concentrated you know in terms of market cap and things like that than it has in the past and so you essentially when you're thinking about those earnings expectations um you know there are there is more concentration to a smaller number of companies to continue to deliver those earnings but the reality is that what's expected it you know has is in part going to come from those sort of high flying stocks but also a big chunk of it more than half of it is expected to come from the s&p 493 so the rest of the market has to deliver in terms of the real earnings outcomes in order to justify the continued appreciation of these these companies and so i think one of the things that's interesting in the in the in the market right now is you you're seeing a lot of people say well you know stock prices are justified because earnings expectations are rising right that they're pointing to those earnings expectations as justification for the current price level but the earnings expectations haven't been delivered it's not they're not pointing to earnings as the thing that's driving the price increase they're pointing to earnings expectations as justifying what's going on and those two things are very very different story if we have a continuation if we have 5% earnings growth over the next 24 months that'll underperform what analyst expect bottoms up analyst expectations are by 20% right so that's that's a pretty big difference in terms of so there's a lot of betting that uh you know that those earnings are going to get delivered the way that they're currently priced in or expect
Nominal Growth and Earnings Expectations,2024-06-26 12:15:04+00:00,2,mWrQAhZGZn0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWrQAhZGZn0,joining us now eric johnson from caner fitzgerald and unlimited bob elliot guys happy friday bob um you think this expansion can go on for a while even if it's paused today because we don't have a persistent situation where yields are up stocks are down slower spending why does that mean this can go on why is disaster not like right around the corner well i think from a real economy perspective we're seeing a uh a situation where income growth remains relatively healthy um you know you're seeing good wage growth that's translating to good nominal spending growth and that's keeping the economy going and powering on the trouble is it's a little too much in terms of inflation which is a bit of a concern for the fed and it's also probably not quite strong enough to meet those sort of extreme earnings expectations that are being priced into the equity market as we move to the back half of the year but do you think this is a good situation still relatively speaking for stocks well i think in general uh as long as we continue to have decent uh nominal growth continue uh you're going to have certainly a range of sectors where uh we'll continue to see you know continued earnings growth continued momentum the real question is where are those extremes in terms of uh pricing in very very high earnings expectations and how are those going to really be achieved you know how are you going to get stocks with 20 30 40% earnings growth expectations in the context of a 5 to 6% nominal gdp growth that's a little more questionable and i think we're starting to see maybe some questioning about how how extreme those expectations are relative to what the reality might be
What is the Current Core Growth Engine of the U.S. Economy?,2024-06-25 12:15:07+00:00,5,dAVKWFZvCdU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAVKWFZvCdU,from a growth perspective it really comes back to the fact that we are in uh an incom driven cycle uh those of you who follow our work regularly are probably uh sick of me talking about the income driven cycle over and over again uh but i think it's an important framework mental framework for thinking about you know what is the core growth engine of this economy and what it is is at some level very simple uh which is that the continued nominal spending growth of households is flowing into nominal earnings growth whether it's wage growth for households or earnings growth for companies which is then allowing companies to continue to raise their wages uh which is supporting again the continuation of nominal spending growth that cycle is one which is it is not a spiral it's self-reinforcing in the sense of one person's income uh and spending then becomes another person's income and then spending so it's self-reinforcing uh and it is uh a durable dynamic because uh the fact that you're spending out of income you know if you look over the last 12 months the savings rate of households is basically flat and so what you're seeing as you see in this chart is that nominal spending is aligning with nominal incomes and so those things are uh are durable in the sense of there isn't an unacceptable uh buildup of excesses that occur as a result of an income driven expansion the way you you know the way we saw for instance back in the ' 06 to8 period when there was you know a debt boom or the way we saw amongst corporations in the 98 to 2000 boom where they were borrowing a lot to invest in new technology and so this is a very sustainable dynamic but it's one that is best thought about as sort of consistent stantly being eroded by that tight monetary policy that's remaining in place for an extended period of time and that's basically what we see if you think about income it comes down to basically two two sources income growth comes down to two sources employment growth and wage growth and when you look at that picture we're basically seeing a sort of persistent grind in terms of both of those elements slowing down over time whereas you know in 21 we had very high employment growth coming out of covid it moderated you know for the 18 months sort of up until january 2023 and really if you look at the employment numbers over the course of the last uh year or so um 18 months you know they've they've certainly moderated relative to the strength that we saw before that's sort of normal in a late cycle environment as we're starting to bump up against our limits but when you take a look at the combination of both payrolls and the household survey you know both of both of which are like imperfect on their own you know payrolls probably has a little too much birth death uh support household survey has some some issues in terms of capturing uh net migration uh and the support uh that exists in terms of measuring the job market there but when you put the two things together it's pretty clear that that employment growth has moderated to some extent and remember this is all in the context of what's being penciled out in terms of expectations is a continue a of the type of strong growth that we saw in 22 and 23 being penciled out to exist for the rest of 24 and then on the earnings side the uh income growth side you've also seen some moderation there here choosing to look at average hourly earnings although you could look at most measures what you see is that sort of annualized earnings growth it was a little stronger a couple years ago it's moderated to some extent and you put that those two things together and what you're seeing is sort of a glacial moderation of overall incomes which is leading to a glacial moderation of spending again in the context of expectations of that earnings growth uh and and economic growth to be at highs for the cycle so the real economy is moderating when expectations are basically at highs
How Might AI Impact Productivity?,2024-06-24 12:15:03+00:00,3,gTi3g20DiqQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTi3g20DiqQ,a question of basically can the ai boom create uh you know a strong uh economic uh set of conditions uh you know akin to what we saw in the late 1990s and what i'd emphasize there it really comes down to productivity uh and uh in order to get a low inflation or falling inflation strong growth environment we have to have a significant increase in productivity and the truth is predicting productivity uh is a challenging task for any macroeconomic investor certainly any macroeconomic investor you looking at it over say a five or 10e period um what i'd emphasize is the uh or to give some perspective you know the essentially the biggest productivity boom that we've seen from technological innov innovation in the post-war period was the introduction of the personal computer and that added something like one to one and a half% real gdp growth on an annualized basis say starting in the late 80s and moving up into the late uh 90s uh that kind of gives you a sense it was paired with huge amounts of business investment uh that was necessary to get uh the the tech the original tech boom uh to occur if we look at what's going on today the orders of magnitude are quite a bit smaller the amount of investment that's being discussed uh you know on a global basis related to ai is in the tens or you know or low hundred billion dollars which is di minimus on a global basis and the main question is what is the productivity enhancement so you know so the second order effects of supporting gdp growth are relatively modest uh certainly compared to the magnitudes that we saw during the the let's call it the tech boom number one uh and then the second question is what are the productivity enhancements and that is a much more ambiguous question where i think we've got to look at the story and be um you know it's you could be a techno optimist you could be a techn pessimist but i think what you have to be is a realist in terms of looking at the data understanding the data and seeing what it's telling you so far there is no indication that there is a significant support to us worker productivity coming from uh from ai related technologies now that may change in the future and you should be open-minded to that possibly changing in the future but as an investor you also have to be open-minded to the fact that it may not be nearly as significant as what a techno optimist might say and so um so that that's the nuby question i think you know it's very hard to understand very hard to to know whether it's likely to move in one direction or another so that's why it's so important to be grounded in the data when you're looking at what's happening
Demographics and the Economy,2024-06-21 12:15:03+00:00,4,P_4in_wBzYA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_4in_wBzYA,talk about these structural changes and what's going on and people not being able to really explain this i'm sure jim and i talked about this before and and and maybe you as well bob but how do you see the demographic factor play into all of this because my suspicion is that that might have a very pivotal role in one not being that easy to explain because we haven't really seen the demographic shifts before uh at least not for a long time and actually this this will take a long time to play out even though a lot of people have talked about it coming you know i can't remember when harry dent became started talking about demographics but it's a long time and nothing happened maybe it's happening now but at such a slow pace that we can't we don't really know how to measure it and model it and so on and so forth i'd love to hear your thoughts about that both of you well i think the the demographic story um you know a big picture level we're pulling uh workers out of the economy productive capacity essentially out of the economy and those workers are continuing to spend to some extent right you know their production value is zero once they retire and their spending uh on houses and goods and services is is certainly not zero um and so you know if you were just to look at that on the surface you'd say hey look that looks like an inflationary on the margin inflationary pressure primarily through the fact that it would likely that demand would likely continue to keep uh labor markets relatively tight uh given that demand continues and labor supply is more moderated i i think um people get confused because they look at japan and they say japan had terrible demographics for an extended period of time and therefore it must be a deflationary force in the economy and i think they confuse the fact that you have to think about uh the demographic environment in the context of the monetary policy environment so the reason why japan had a big deflationary environment is because their monetary policy was way too tight for 20 years 30 years even there's a question about whether it's too tight even today on a uh secular basis and so the effective outcome will be a function of the inflationary dynamic that comes from uh labor losses relative to the monetary policy and the accepted acceptable amount of nominal demand that the fed implements and so what if the fed is basically says hey look we're going to have the same amount of nominal demand i think this is basically what's happening right now fed's like we want good nominal demand 5 to 6% nominal demand growth but the labor force you know goes from expanding at one and one one or one and a half% a year the way it was before you know back in the 90s to zero to negative well you know very simply you can't have those two things work out you can't have the same rate of nominal demand growth and you know uh significantly less people uh unless you have you know incredible productivity boom which is poss you know certainly that's a possible option or higher prices like that's that's just the way it works out or you have to get labor supply you know from somewhere else which you know we've gotten a little bit of that and it's kind of offset excess retirements and so as have been as aute as it would have been otherwise but like that's that's how those figures have to work out so it's really the that interplay between the demographics and the fed that will determine whether it's inflationary or deflationary ahead
Reshoring Stimulates Growth (and Inflation),2024-06-19 12:15:00+00:00,3,7ggDh_g7kIY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ggDh_g7kIY,think about this this idea of the cost of labor is is reshoring a big part of this continued um rise of inflation you know it seems to me that considering the the cost of building new plants abroad and adding the labor this and especially the skilled labor that is difficult to find as as we just spoke about that seems to me like a cost that is eventually going to be passed on to the consumer that will only add to this inflation of goods prices yeah i think anytime uh you go through a period of globalization the whole point of globalization is find the lowest cost producer and we've gone through like 30 or 40 years of finding the lowest cost producer very very successfully and so a process of deglobalization uh and in particular you know and in particular creating parallel supply chains in one form or another essentially is just saying we're going to create supply where there is uh that is not as low cost as the supply we would otherwise choose to have um and that's not to say that it it's necessarily a bad decision to do that there's lots of um let's say non-economic reasons to do that uh from a you know from a a a defense perspective uh um you know a domestic uh resiliency perspective etc um in terms of economic growth there's also benefits growth benefits to actually doing that if you build factories you put people to work and that is absolutely beneficial in terms of when you're thinking about us conditions a big part of actually why us economic conditions have been so strong has been a lot of uh business non you know non-residential fixed investment factory building uh like you're describing um and so you know that's a that's a positive growth outcome the issue is it's just it's also inflationary and so that's the tradeoff is that um you know you can have things like onshoring uh building factories duplicating supply chains and the benefits that come with that it's just you're doing so in a way that creates more price pressure and so that's just a tradeoff when you're thinking about it from a policy maker perspective between say for instance geopolitical independence relative to the fact that prices might be you know price growth might be one % higher that's just a that's a that's a that's a political trade-off not a ma not a not a uh there's no sort of macroeconomic truth to that there's just a political trade-off that exists uh when you're making those decisions right
"Inflation, Disinflation and Labor (How They Connect) What happenes when 6 million people drop out?",2024-06-18 12:15:00+00:00,7,AoCDKPUmrUA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoCDKPUmrUA,bob when we think about you know these let's say these these countervailing forces of inflation what are some of the forces that are still driving inflation higher on the sk on you know the positive side of the scale are we seeing you know a an absorption of goods and services pricing on the growth of the money supply that was added since co yeah i mean i i i think um in a large diversified service oriented economy the us a big part of what drives inflation is services prices and um and those services prices uh you know it's the services cost relative to the productive growth of you know of creating those services and so i i think when you look at the the us case in particular we had a lot of the initial inflation was goods oriented inflation supply shocks created a squeeze in goods used cars new cars you know uh furniture just just all sorts of stuff like that which went up a lot and also because we were in covid our consumption pattern shifted a lot to those goods because we weren't engaged in you know service oriented activities nearly as much and so that created a squeeze on those prices but as the supply chains have been mostly resolved there meaningfully resolved we started to see those prices um certainly uh rise less and actually many of those prices have been actively falling over the course of the last couple of years um that has been a negative i mean a negative meaning a a a beneficial drag on inflationary pressures but what's happened is wage growth has continued to you know has picked up during that period and so and wage growth basically defines uh services inflation like if you're if you're engaged in a in a very straightforward services let's just say lawnmowing again um you know what what is the underlying cost structure of lawnmowing i mean it's basically like gas although that's a relatively small amount in the scheme of things and and the labor cost so if wages are going up 5% a year then you basically have to pay you know you have to ask for more 5% a year uh an increase in prices that's just that's just how it goes um in in order to maintain your margins and so i think that's basically what we're seeing in terms of what's creating the structural a big you know important structural support to inflation being elevated is just that that sort of in any ways very boring like you know wage inflation is inflation is price inflation that's just how it goes it becomes price inflation just becomes price inflation yeah right because uh because otherwise businesses would be um businesses margins would be hit and and um there's been a little bit of a story particularly with big businesses where their margins haven't really been hit but if you're uh and and they've they've raised their prices in excess of their labor costs for for like s&p 500 companies but like if you're i mean if you're literally a lawnmower uh you know a lawnmower company like it's pretty it's pretty straightforward in terms of what your costs are relative to what you know the the price is that you're charging people and and then what again i i'm i think there's a lot of good let's say symmetry or or um ways to explain and and paint this picture of a lot of these things that we're talking about today by really using a scale so on the other side of that scale what are some of the big deflationary forces that have helped temper these these hotter pce numbers for example um that we've been seeing over the last couple months well i mean good goods uh and capital goods in particular have been have uh have benefited from a fair amount of disinflation or deflation uh over the course of the last um you know 12 to 18 months and so you think about something like used cars um that used car prices yeah used car prices rents have moderated uh the the price level hasn't really changed but the uh pace of price growth has slowed um in part uh you know something like used cars or or furniture or other things has been a function of supply chains starting to get resolved um some of like housing and particularly rents um you know has benefited over the course of the last 18 24 months from a significant increase in supply particularly in those hot sun belt cities where you're seeing you know a lot of apartment multifam apartment supply basically at secular highs um which has brought a lot of supply into the market which has helped depress rents uh bring rents down or bring the growth of rents down uh considerably um and so you know those in a lot of ways that's like um any price is just a function of supply and demand and in a lot of ways what we saw on the good side as well as to some extent in the housing side is an increase in supply that has helped create uh you know has helped bring down price pressures so and and the problem actually i just i would just say and the problem is the the problem is with goods and houses you can produce a lot more of them the problem is with services it's actually pretty tough to produce a lot more of them at least uh at least on an 18-year lag right in terms of people getting into the workforce um and so or even just training new skilled labor too right exactly exactly right and so i think that that's where like the supply the supply problem if you're going to think about it from a us economic perspective is that we have a labor supply problem so we still you know in some ways the inflation problem is still a supply problem it's just a labor supply problem not really goods supply problem and so um and that's been exacerbated postco for a number of reasons i one there's actually you know a fair amount of let's say postco illness related reduction in productive capacity by by you know millions of people basically in one form or another um and then on top of it there was there's been an increase in excess retirements uh that has far outpaced what expectations were a few million of those and so you know you've pulled like six million people out of the labor market over the course of a couple of years that's a pretty big impact in terms of thinking about labor supply it's pretty hard to find six million people uh to come into the labor market um you know particularly the skilled labor market in with any you know at that at that pace or that that uh that rapid uh an increase in labor supply
Long Cycles of Investment in Natural Resources Create Mismatches (with Demand),2024-06-17 12:15:08+00:00,5,vVJrCJrL8nc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVJrCJrL8nc,do you look at h the the cycles of investment versus underinvestment in particular um sectors you know like like let's say energy or um metals and how that ends up affecting how those businesses are run and how that ends up affecting their their growth their income their their bottom lines yeah well i think for a lot of um particularly for resources uh resource oriented companies there is uh there is a sort of natural super cycle when it comes to um investment and production and a big reason why that is is that um the lag times are just so huge so long right from the point in which you break ground to the point in which you receive production you know in some cases it can be 10 years right from you know the the starting to the permitting process to the point in which you know uh metal is coming out of the ground and so in that sense the supply dynamics are relatively fixed and relatively well-known ahead and undulate with a 10-year lag whereas demand it goes up and down you know moves with a business cycle which is a much shorter oriented cycle and so that creates a big mismatch between the projected production and the demand sometimes on the upside sometimes on the downside right sometimes there's way too much supply relative to weak demand sometimes there's not nearly enough supply the reality is we went through you know 15 years of very weak commodity prices really i mean commodity prices basically peaked at you know just before the financial crisis and have been you know were soft like crv was basically soft for 15 years afterwards and only recently started to get close to where those tops were um back prior to the financial crisis which has then meant that there's been basically no investment no no investment in supply which means that you know now today we're living in the resource world based upon the investments that were decided 10 or 15 years ago when prices were falling which means we don't have enough supply relative to the investment which is the type of circumstances that create a squeeze on prices um and create that sort of super cycle high higher and so i think we're sort of the grand scheme of things early in that super cycle rather than later in that super cycle um given you know the shifts and demand that have occurred across a lot of different assets and and when you look at these things you know we talk about orange juice we could talk about copper we could talk about coco we talk about all these things as if they're idiosyncratic things and of course there's idiosyncracies in each one of them but but it's important not to lose sight of the fact that there's a structural story here which is that you know basically bad price per performance for 10 years in commodities has now led to a dynamic where we're having much better price performance in the future yeah and i i think the important part is being able to kind of see that coming um that ends up being you know your your edge in finding those markets and those opportunities right for sure for sure yeah and i actually like i mean the commodity markets are i i find um to be a a rich source of uh of alpha because um because they often play in these sort of nice concrete you know long cycle dynamics so if you can understand the supply cycle dynamic and then you know get the macroeconomy demand side right you can actually um you know you can you can do a pretty good job there uh in terms of understanding what the price moves are going to be and you know big picture is um those things are signaling higher prices ahead not lower prices ahead which if we go back to our inflationary story or inflation conversation that's you know they're not the only driver of inflation we already talked about how services are such an important driver but it's certainly a driver that will likely be a positive support to inflation over the next 10 15 years whereas before what we saw last 10 or 15 years was a negative pressure on it inflation from and i think kind of going back to our our other conversation about removing risk i think that that also has a role to play in in being able to take risk off the table for making those types of of investments as well yeah for sure for sure that's uh that's a uh a very important part of the story yeah absolutely
Unlimited Macroeconomic Webinar June 2024,2024-06-15 12:15:02+00:00,51,Ub5_jS8OGFg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub5_jS8OGFg,[music] conversation and just kind of take a step back uh for those of you who have been following our thinking for a while now um you know really what what we the the story that we laid out um almost uh you know more than 18 months ago was this basic idea that uh the us was experiencing a late cycle uh that late cycle was predominantly income driven rather than credit driven uh that it would lead to inflation that remained elevated relative to the fed's target for an extended period of time and that the fed would need to tighten uh meaningfully uh in response and that it would take a lot of tightening much more so than people expected in the summer of 2022 it would take a lot more tightening and for that tightening to exist longer be uh in place longer uh than people expected in order to slow the economy uh and start to alleviate those inflationary pressures and i show these three charts because they basically show how that story which was a very non-consensus view of how this cycle would play out uh certainly in the summer of 2022 has largely been the story for the last uh 18 months or almost two years which is you know the unemployment rate has been you know at four or below for an extended period of of time uh asset prices uh have uh performed poorly relative to cash for almost two years uh using the chart in the middle which is uh which is rpar which is a portfolio of risky assets balanced to different economic conditions uh so not overweight growth or or inflation or things like that uh and then finally that interest rates which were raised relatively aggressive ly uh through the course of 2022 uh and really sort of entered the range that we've been in uh by the uh fall of 2022 have been elevated for an extended period of time in this range between basically four and 5% uh on the short end and on the long end to add that all up together you know that the cycle is basically playing out uh as we had expected over the course of the last two years and the thing i would emphasize about that is that um that that cycle playing out is not a cycle that's playing out without a slow down it's just a much slower transition than what most people had expected but a transition is occurring in the economy we've had elevated interest rates for an extended period of time uh as a result that is starting to weigh on various sectors of the economy and slowly very slow slowly glacially the economy is moderating uh and uh we're transitioning to uh you know a slower economy that is necessary in order to bring inflation down towards the fed's mandate but that process is not it's not an instantaneous one and it's not an acute one this isn't a crisis dynamic this is a traditional late cycle slowdown of the economy which is flowing into uh which is flowing into moderating inflationary pressures um and that's basically what we're start to seeing there with the unemployment rate a modest loosening of the labor market certainly the move from the mid threes to you know right around 4% that is not a significant loosening of the labor market and 4% on any long-term basis is extremely low um but it does reflect the fact that there is some softening occurring in the economy and that's an important point to be making which is that um that softening of the economy is occurring at a time when the expectations of how growth will transpire in the future are finally catching up to the near two years of strong growth and so that's what we show here on this chart which i i think it's just a really important uh dynamic whenever you're trading financial markets you're always trading trading financial markets relative to the expectations that are priced in and for an extremely long period of time in that cycle over the course of the last two or two and a half years we had basically seen a variety of times when expectations were that growth was likely to slow materially uh and the kickoff of this year uh was really no exception to that story we had been in one of those transition points where growth expectations uh you know if you look over here on the right hand side entering the year by in december of last year we're running at you know under 1% real gdp growth year-over-year um which was quite soft certainly in the context to the fact that stocks had been booming bond yields had come down and the economy was receiving one of the biggest stimulations that it had seen in 40 years but what's really happened over the course of the last uh four or five months has been a transition that transition has been where people are now increasingly expecting the uh strong growth that we've seen over the course of the last couple of years to persist essentially forever just at the time that we're starting to see signs that that growth is starting to moderate and so that's what you see here in this chart uh that's what you see here it's really the growth expectations you know really by april uh april and may had reached a fevered pitch it was a big reason why stocks outperformed bonds in the first quarter but we've gotten to a point where those growth expectations are very elevated so you know private investment above 3% you know household demand two and a half to 3% and overall real gdp growth expected for the year at 2.5% or 2.4% that's important because we had a real gdp number in the first quarter that was 1.3% % and so what that means is we have to what's essentially being priced in as expectations for the rest of the year is a 3% real gdp growth rate through the end of the year from economists expectations but it's not just economists this isn't just theoretical economists going out there and penciling out 3% real gdp growth for the rest of the year it's also in that sort of expectation is in stock prices uh and the current elevated stock prices that you see earnings expectations uh which you can see on a year over-year basis on the left-hand side and on a quarterly basis on the right hand side are now pricing in you know double digigit expected returns in earnings uh and in particular the q4 2024 bottoms up analyst expectations for earnings year-over-year growth is 177% that's notable in the context of the fact that earnings growth if you look over the previous six quarters hasn't been in particularly significant and it's also important in the context of saying look we've had a pretty good growth picture in the us context pretty good nominal growth over the course of the last couple of years but that nominal growth is five or six perc that nominal growth isn't anywhere close to the type of nominal growth at the top line that would be necessary to generate the sort of expected earnings growth that's currently priced in the market and that is further uh extended expectations of that are further extended with earnings growth expected to grow around 14% in 2025 over 2024 now of course these analyst expectations they're always a little elevated relative to the reality and they always get cycled down but i think what they reflect this and the economist expectation is expectations for the us economy what what we've had is after years of people finally sort of coming to acceptance that the us economy was stronger than they expected they're now penciling that out to basically continue for forever just at the time when the softening is occurring in addition to that we continue to have inflation in the economy that remains elevated in comparison to the fed's mandate so whether you look at uh economist expectations uh for 2024 at 2.8% the fed's dot plot which was also at 2.8% um or just simply penciling out based upon the data that we've seen you know the rest of the year at 0.2% what you'd see is core pce numbers that are still above what the fed's you know the fed's mandate and so while we've certainly made progress from the point where inflation was running you know at 5% core pce at between five and 6% a couple of years ago inflation remains a little too elevated and those folks you know who are looking at the most recent cpi report from yesterday and extrapolating those relatively you know extrapolating that into the future i i' i'd uh suggest some caution given the fact that both the internals of that cpi report suggest that it was an unusually weak report as well as the fact that triangulation uh across other measures of inflation don't show nearly the abrupt slowdown that would be implied by that one months report and so i think penciling out this basic picture of you know inflation continues to be uh elevated not as extremely elevated but moderately elevated relative to the to the fed's target ahead so we have um you know very high expectations of growth elevated inflation uh expectations around central bank policy which have started to moderate uh to the point where really what we're seeing in term even even with yesterday's you know expectations you know yesterday's inflation print you know the fed is largely reset expectations that they're going to cut between one and two times over the course of the year uh through the remainder of the year now they might cut zero they might cut two you know the it's certainly a lot different than what it was when we were coming into the year when we held our uh kickoff of the year webinar outlook webinar and at that time uh we we strongly questioned whether it was reasonable to expect the fed to cut seven times now we're down at one or one to two times which is in the ballpark of probably what's reasonable on on the margin my expectation would be given the data that we're seeing that they'd be a little slower than what's priced in but the easy money has been made on that trade whether you you know any way you take it what that shows is an environment where uh central bank policy is not going to bail out the financial markets anytime soon we have a continuation most likely of higher for longer policy that is at least going to last through the end of the year that's all happening in an environment where expectations of risk in the economy are basically at secular lows whether you look at the vix or you look at credit spreads both are reasonable ways to try and get a sense as to how risk is being priced and so um you know in both cases you're basically looking at tights uh and tights multi-decade tights when it comes to the risk being priced into the economy and so i think uh i i think that's an important story when you just when you look at the picture which is uh very high growth expectations no volatility priced in inflation that's above expectations central banks that are tightening you know that continue to run relatively tight monetary policy and the last thing i'd emphasize is no risk premium priced into to financial assets to holding financial assets and so whether you look at the bond market and you look at the term premium on bonds you know we basically have a term premium on bonds that's about zero you know there's lots of different ways to measure this and think about this but the basic picture is the term premium in bonds that you're getting today is equivalent to roughly the average over the course of the last uh 15 years and the us economy today is very different than what it's been on average over the last 15 years um and so you're getting zero term premium in bonds and on the equity side from a longer term perspective if you just look at the equity risk premium which is you know one way to look at it is the earnings yield minus the real bond yield that's what you see over here on the right hand side what you see is essentially the premium for holding equity at this point relative to holding bonds is about as low as it's been since the early 2000s and so you just add that up you know there is uh there is no premium for holding or low premium for holding equities rel relative to bonds long-term bonds there's very low premium in holding long-term bonds relative to cash there's very little risk priced into the system and so we basic and there's very high growth expectations priced in so if you take that picture as a whole what you'd look at and you'd say is an incredibly benign scenario is already reflected in asset prices today despite the fact that we're seeing inflation above expectations and a continued typ monetary policy environment and i think you know drawing on andy conen's uh classic chart in terms of the various islands i think it's very important to sort of put in your mind what set of events needs to occur in order to get further asset price appreciation in this environment you know we're already uh heading east of soft landing island um being priced in almost to a to a near magical environment where bond yields are falling at the same time stock prices are rising and the same time growth expectations remain at elevated levels because if they fell that would hurt stocks and so what is the constellation of what has to occur in order to get something like a 10% rise in stocks and bonds over the course of the remainder of the year and what that requires is essentially a significant decline uh you know another 50 basis point decline in the bond yield at a time when growth expectations in the us economy would have to continue to remain uh at extremely elevated levels and earnings expectations would have to remain at extremely elevated levels that's going to be a pretty hard lift is the reality because uh the type of environment that would typically create a meaningful decline in bond yields at this point um you know would be the sort of environment where you have to get an economic slowdown and you sort of see that in the market action even today where um some modestly weaker than expected growth news and modestly weaker than expected inflation news is netting out to an environment where bonds are rallying but stocks aren't and so you're not you know the question is how do you add it all up to get that stock rally and a bond rally at the same time it's going to be pretty difficult in an environment of tight monetary policy for an extended period and inflation which remains elevated and all this really comes back to from a growth perspective it really comes back to the fact that we are in uh an income driven cycle uh those of you who follow our work regularly are probably uh sick of me talking about the income driven cycle over and over again uh but i think it's an important framework mental framework for thinking about you know what is the core growth engine of this economy and what it is is at some level very simple uh which is that the continued nominal spending growth of households is flowing into nominal earnings growth whether it's wage growth for households or earnings growth for companies which is then allowing companies to continue to raise their wages uh which is supporting again the continuation of nominal spending grow that cycle is one which is it is not a spiral it's self-reinforcing in the sense of one person's income uh and spending then becomes another person's income and then spending so it's self- reinforcing uh and it is uh a durable dynamic because uh the fact that you're spending out of income you know if you look over the last 12 months the savings rate of households is basically flat and so what you're seeing as you see in this chart is that nominal spending is aligning with nominal incomes and so those things are uh are durable in the sense of there isn't an unacceptable uh buildup of excesses that occur as a result of an income driven expansion the way you you know the way we saw for instance back in the 06 608 period when there was you know a debt boom or the way we saw amongst corporations in the 98 to 2000 boom where they were borrowing a lot to invest in new technology and so this is a very sustainable dynamic but it's one that is best thought about as sort of consistently being eroded by that tight monetary policy that's remaining in place for an extended period of time and that's basically what we see if you think about income it comes comes down to basically two two sources income growth comes down to two sources employment growth and wage growth and when you look at that picture we're basically seeing a sort of persistent grind in terms of both of those elements slowing down over time whereas you know in 2021 we had very high employment growth coming out of covid it moderated you know for the 18 months sort of up until january 2023 and really if you look at the employment numbers over the course of the last uh year or so um 18 months you know they they've certainly moderated relative to the strength that we saw before that's sort of normal in a late cycle environment as we're starting to bump up against our limits but when you take a look at the combination of both payrolls and the household survey you know both of both of which are like imperfect on their own you know payrolls probably has a little too much birth death uh support household survey has some some issues in terms of capturing uh net migration uh and the support uh that exists in terms of measuring the job market there but when you put the two things together it's pretty clear that that employment growth has moderated to some extent and remember this is all in the context of what's being penel out in terms of expectations is a continuation of the type of strong growth that we saw in 22 and 23 being penel out to exist for the rest of 24 and then on the earning side the uh income growth side you've also seen some moderation there you're choosing to look at average hourly earnings although you could look at most measures what you see is that sort of annualized earnings growth it was a little stronger a couple years ago it's moderated to some extent and you put that those two things together and what you're seeing is sort of a glacial moderation of overall incomes which is leading to a glacial moderation of spending again in the context of expectations of that earnings growth uh and and economic growth to be at highs for the cyle so the real economy is moderating when expectations are basically at highs um but even with that i think one of the challenges from the fed's perspective is even with the moderation and income growth and in particular wage growth we haven't quite gotten to the point where inflation has durably come down to the fed's mandate and not just measured inflation which you know has all sorts of limitations what i describe is structural inflation hasn't come down sufficiently to the fed's mandate if you look over on the left hand side eci another measure of uh of compensation uh that is sort of uh the sort of gold standard measure of compensation which has certainly moderated over the course of the last couple years but remains a few points more elevated than what we saw in the preco period uh and you compare that to what's going on with it with uh productivity growth because ultimately just very simply if you think about what creates structural inflation in an economy it's the difference between nominal wage growth and productivity growth uh and the reason why that is is if you just think about nominal wage growth is how much are we paying someone to do an hour's worth of production uh and you think about productivity growth which is you know how fast is their ability to produce growing the difference between those two things essentially has to be resolved by changes in price because it's just simply the amount of dollars of income people have relative to the amount of incremental stuff uh that's being produced and of course there's a lot of measurement you know imperfection in that but that concept is definitely true and what we see in terms of uh the picture of productivity i think is one that should concern most people who think that the inflation problem is fully resolved which is even though we've had a moderation in nominal income growth as highlighted in the previous slide productivity growth remains relatively modest you know for all the promise of technological innovation radically changing the productive capacity of the economy essentially we haven't seen any productivity growth since the amount of spike that we saw in the layoff dynamic immediately surrounding covid and the most recent quarterly numbers certainly didn't didn't suggest uh that we were on a renewed path and so i think this is really the nubby question which is are we seeing are we going to see productivity we're definitely seeing wage growth that's elevated relative to pre-co that's kind of a given the question is what's going on with productivity growth because that's going to help define what the structural inflationary pressure is and really are we on that blue line of accelerating productivity growth or are we going to stay within the bands of the gold lines for an extended period perod and what i'd highlight is if you think about you know predicting productivity is a very challenging thing to do but if you think about what other points of triangulation you have for instance other developed economies places like the europe like europe and the uk uh have seen near zero productivity growth for a number of years as well this uh you know and those economies are certainly um while they might have uh less uh structural vibrancy than the us economy many of the access to you know innovative technologies and things like that are all sort of the same in those environments as well i mean there's a reason why european growth as a simple example has been running around zero give or take for the last couple of years yet the unemployment rate is at secular lows which highlights the fact that labor productivity remains relatively uh low in the in uh in a long-term context and the same you know is a little softer in terms of the unemployment rate um uh in terms of the unemployment rate but uh in the uk uh but the same basic picture uh exists there as well and so you basically see this picture this is what's creating the structural employment so we have moderating growth nominal growth and at the same time we have inflation pressures that still look as though they're going to be present for an extended period of time and of course measured inflation uh numbers here continue to be elevated relative to where we were preco you know pce equivalent the fed said 2.8 economists are expecting 2.8 you know even running at uh you know if you look across many of these numbers uh these are pce numbers through april so they don't include what will likely be a very soft print in may uh but the general trend here is you know continued to see uh inflation that is modestly above moderately above what the fed's mandate is so they're going to have to maintain given that context they've been clear if year-over-year inflation uh in the us is 2.8% if you just take the dots at their word they will maintain the fed will maintain tight monetary policy through the end of the year in addition to that the fact that we're likely to see money remain tight we're also likely to see a continued flow of significant bond selling uh by uh by the us treasury as a function of the continued elevated deficits the is basically committed to say that they are likely to issue the same uh share of bonds versus bills on the deficit for uh an extended period of time uh and so what you see here is a basic story where the amount of gross issuance total bonds and notes gross issuance you know is likely to remain uh at multi you know at basically secular highs uh in an environment that's very different from that previous high when there was substantial money printing you know we continue to have the fed uh to a modest extent uh roll down the balance sheet or slow the balance sheet and we continue to see this pressure of constant bond sales coming into the market any one day of course those bond market sales can be absorbed but over a period of time uh in one form or another asset prices need to fall and when i say asset prices i mean aggregate asset prices right so something like an rpar uh you know a balance portfolio of asset prices needs to fall in one form or another given the constant supply and quantitative tightening that's coming into the market and that's only exacerbated by the fact that the federal reserve continues to run monetary policy that's relatively tight for an extended period of time so given these pressures the real question is basically how do you get the next 10% leg up in either stocks or bonds and i think the story um that that has to be told is pretty challenging it's a pretty challenging uh you know needle to thread in order to get an environment where that that next leg up and asset prices actually occurs um and then the pressure on the us bond market i think is particularly important when you think sort of globally like globally the world is benchmarking off of the us bond market you know basically all assets in one form or another are being benchmarked from it you see there in the upper lefthand corner the shifts in the bond market you know the up move in april and then the down move and chop over the course of the last six weeks that basically aligns with what you're seeing in terms of the bond market action in the uk you know us conditions are different from that those in the uk yet uk bond yield is basically trading on us conditions with slightly less beta you see that in the stock market you know in april the bond yield rise creating a drag on the stock market and then the resolution creating a lift you see that in global commodity prices they're shown with the crb and so you add that all up and you actually see a situation where you know the us bond yield what is transpiring with the us bond yield becomes the central lever to what's going on with the with the world and so when you're thinking about what is going to create a further up leg in asset prices what you have to say is even an environment of tighter than expected monetary policy and higher for longer even in an environment where there's tons of bond supply coming into the market from the fiscal picture uh you have to create in order to believe that aet prices are likely to rise particularly stocks in the us are likely to rise um you're gonna have to have a story of bond yields falling meaningfully without a significant lowering of growth expectations and that's going to be a pretty that's a pretty challenging lift i think the other thing uh that's important to think about when you're thinking about the bond market is just how important those foreign central bank flows have been or those not central bank but foreign private sector cloths have been you know us yields for almost 25 years uh typically ran below those of uh foreign counterparts and the reason why that was was because the us was the reserve currency and so we could run lower interest rates relative to the rest of the world and be and experience a constant bid on us bonds um and uh the shifts of the us economy being stronger than the rest of the world uh have lifted bond yields over the course of uh you know have lifted bond yields relative to the rest of the world um you know for an extended period of time and what we're seeing is a significant flow into us bonds that is riant on foreign private investors flowing through and buying us bonds the challenge with that is that the way in which that will persist is if those other economies experience substantive easing pressures in order to basically bring down their rates and make us rates more attractive and bring capital into the us and i think there's reasonable questions about whether that's likely to persist now of course the ecb uh you know did cut for the first time this cycle uh recently uh but i think anyone who was listening to what was going on and and seeing the path there it it was about the most hawkish cut that you could have expected coming out of the ecp and the and and the reason why that is is i think there's two main issues that continue to exist from the ecb's perspective the first is that economic conditions while they have been structurally soft are not that bad unemployment rate is at secular lows uh and if anything what we see is some timely measures shown here by the composite pmi are suggesting that there might be actually a pickup in economic activity uh over the course of the last 6 to n months and then second of course is the problem that inflation underlying structural inflationary pressures in europe remain relatively elevated here showing negotiated wages uh on the lower leftand side uh printing a number that it continues to be elevated relative to history and certainly quite a bit higher than where we were preco i think it's a really important point because essentially what that's saying is where is the urgency for the ecb to do a whole heck of a lot more i think they had signaled that they intended to cut and they delivered that cut but that doesn't necessarily mean they're entering a substantial cutting cycle immediately and the flavor in the uk is very similar uh margin i'd say marginally um marginally less uh in you know it's essentially the same which is you have economic conditions that are weak but accelerating and you have inflationary pressures particularly around weight ag growth that continue to be relatively elevated uh unemployment in the most recent report uh earlier this week did soften just a tad but we're still seeing very high nominal wage growth in the uk and it's going to be pretty tough for the bank of england to deliver a massive flow of cuts uh in an in an economy that's showing some signs of perking up and in an economy that continues to have very elevated wage growth relative to pre-co levels so um so the bailout you know for for global investors uh the uk uh and europe you know they serve as just a they serve as a market that you can trade i think the most important impact that these uh policy shifts have on what's going on in the us is that we're unlikely to see a significant uh shift towards easing in those economies and without that significant shift towards easing the flow of capital into the us bond market is unlikely to be nearly as strong as it's been and so that is just another pressure which is limiting the amount of flow of capital into the us bond market and us financial assets which adds further pressure uh on us financial assets uh japan look japan it continues to be uh soft uh and despite the fact that um you know despite the fact that they've been running very easy monetary policy for an extended period of time you know inflation has come down it's below their target now growth has been negative to of the last three quarters and uh that zero isn't doing a lot for the japanese economy um and it's pretty remarkable how uh the pressure on the yen has continued to persist even in the context of us yields coming down something like 50 basis points over the course of the last last couple weeks and japanese yields surging 20 or 30 basis points as well and despite all of that and the huge interventions that the bank of japan has uh delivered over the course of the last couple of months the japanese yan is basically where we were uh you know six weeks six or eight weeks ago uh in terms of trading in the high 150s i think what that highlights is from an underlying perspective this is not an economy that's transitioning to meaningful titan anytime soon uh and i would be cautious about interpreting rhetoric in that direction we'll uh get a little bit of a read in terms of what the boj is thinking uh late this evening um but we're unlikely to see a big shift to tightening uh and the underlying without that shift of tightening the underlying structural pressures on the end continue to be uh relatively substantial to the downside um and so while the boj or theof might continue to intervene to um push a disorderly you know to to push against a disorderly decline in the currency it certainly doesn't look like the type of fundamental conditions have changed meaningfully enough to create an environment where the yen is shifting towards an extended appreciation period china i'll leave off with china which i think again from a from a uh trading markets perspective the dynamics in china are interesting as their own market um but i think probably more interesting from a global markets perspective is how the pressure on the chinese economy and currency is flowing into the rest of the world and particularly leading to domestic demand for gold what we see here you know we've gone for three years with wave after wave of this is going to be the china rebound this is going to be a policy-driven china rebound and there is no indication that the chinese authorities have done anything close to enough to create a meaningful and lasting substantive rebound and so while sentiment whips around positive and negative uh the reality hasn't really changed much which is china is growing in a way that is uh weak relative to its underlying uh its underlying productivity uh and it's underlying potential growth uh and policy makers aren't doing enough to deal with that uh and you know why they're doing that you know that's that's a that's a political question rather than a macroeconomic question uh from a macroeconomic perspective we can simply observe what they're doing and see what the likely consequences are and so as a simple example on the upper left you know for all the talk of the great chinese rebound and uh i think beautiful deleveraging of 2024 um it clearly got a lot of demand going uh for from foreign investors investing in foreign chinese stocks uh listed here by the hong kong market but that has faded in recent weeks and the amount of the rebound that we've seen uh in the shanghai market it's basically faded uh all the hope in the shanghai market and instead the chinese economic conditions and the lower panel basically haven't changed if you read a timely basis based on the pmis and if anything the chinese the pressure on the chinese currency has continued to be relatively substantive with timely measures of chinese intervention in the upper right showing some of the most significant intervention needing to be taken uh since the currency missteps taken uh in the mid-2010s uh with the currency trading up at uh you know against the uh against the band uh and um and you know significant intervention occurring uh for most you know in most cases for most investors this doesn't really have too much of an impact in part because um while the chinese are intervening or there's indications that there's direct and indirect primarily indirect intervention through the state-owned banks most of that's done on the short end and so it's not really having an impact on global asset prices the way the significant sales that happened during the um the mid 2010s currency problems uh you know so it's not really having much of an impact on uh western invest investment and economies but where it is having an impact is on the gold market where the continued pressure on the chinese exchange rate uh continues to put sort of a bid under gold uh even with higher us interest rates uh that bid on gold continues to exist i think some of the interesting market action um that we're seeing uh you know today i think is an interesting example where you're seeing you know bond yields rally and gold sell off that's a sort of uh dynamic that would be unusual since typically gold rallies when bond yields are falling um and the reason why that is is because you know gold is non interest bearing money and so lower fiat bond yields should lead to higher gold prices but what it highlights is maybe the transmission mechanism is not through um the us bond yield but through the pressure on the chinese currency with us bond yields falling uh pressure on the chinese currency moderates to some extent which then creates less pressure for domestic residents to be buying gold and therefore causes gold to fall that's a flipp and correlation that's pretty unusual um relative to history but i think aligns with the fundamental pressures that we're seeing um and and the reason why that i i connect to the fundamental pressures is to say is to highlight just how important chinese gold demand has been in terms you know or how much gold has benefited from from uh from the chinese stress whether it's you know sales of us financial assets uh shifting into gold by the central bank or whether it's private purchases of gold in china given that there aren't a lot of other investment options stocks are weak and falling house prices are falling rapidly very challenging for chinese residents to move money abroad and so really there there's just not a lot of options left uh wealth management products um you know have largely been undermined in terms of their credit risk uh and and long-term expected return there just is not that much of an option if you're a chinese gold on or a chinese onshore saver and so gold is one of the few options that's available and so we're seeing that occur whether it's the bid in gold as a function of the uh a function of the you know chinese demand gold in in yuan has continued to rally or whether it's the literal non-monetary imports of gold that we're seeing in the trade balance so gold being the primary beneficiary uh of the chinese stress all right we'll go to questions we'll go to audience questions here uh give me a second if you have other questions feel free to enter them i'm just going to take a a sip here and we'll get into these questions um i think i'll i'll hit the first question here which is um with uh inflation data surprisingly the downside in the fed surprising to the hawkish side um does more fed hawkishness need to be priced in um and i think you know the the short answer of that is that um the you know the current story in terms of the fed hawkishness the let's say trading on the short rate side you know a lot of as i said sort of a lot of the easy money there has been made um you know given the confluence of conditions um uh particularly seeing a bit of weakening growth or rising uh rise in unemployment all that kind of suggests that um or i should say reaffirms that you know more likely than not much more likely than not the fed you know the fed is either going to be on pause or going to be cutting rates and from here and so the real question is how fast do they transition to that point and one of the ways in which they can um one of the ways in which they can basically maintain or create tight monetary policy is just by continuously pushing out uh expectations of easing and i think um this story uh you know the the the presser and the dots that we saw yesterday i think was a good indication of how they intend to signal that which is sort of constantly say we're going to cut but that cut is going to come into the future until they get the macroeconomic data that aligns with it so you know could we see two years bump back up to five sure it's possible it's not really a you know the difference between 475 and five on twos it's just not that big a deal odds are they'll keep pushing this out and we'll start to see maybe later in the year um unwinding some of those expectations of cuts uh that ex in 2025 um if we go up here um uh some question about basically what's going on with some of the the wage data um uh you know i think it's pretty well triangulated that wage growth data uh across a lot of different measures continues to be a point or two above where we were preo uh the eci being an indication but you can look at atlanta fed you can look at average hourly earnings you can look at um you know the as an example the compensation of employees which is referenced here you know is still uh is still above where we were on average on a pre-co basis and so that's really the sticking point is we have inflation we have wage inflation that is above where we were preo and at the same time we have productivity growth that's looking a bit weaker than where we were pre-co and you add those two things together and that's the combination of dynamics that would create uh more structural inflation in the economy um what are the market-based measures that are signaling higher prices and growth other than analyst estimates or or uh economist forecast well stocks are at all-time highs uh and so you know there's probably no better indication of strong growth expectations than stocks continuing to push to new highs and so i think in a lot of ways the analyst estimat they're reflection of the fact that the overall sentiment towards us equities is very strong in the market on a on a sort of strategic basis and so um you know the fact that stocks are pushing new highs is a reflection of the fact like the fact that sex are pushing new highs in an environment of elevated interest rates you know over the course of the last couple of years all of that aligns with the fact that um the market-based market participants expectations of future growth are very strong um and then you know you can look at things like economists and analyst expectations and they of course are also aligning with that and that's really kind of gives you a full triangulation if stock prices weren't nearly as elevated as they were or if you didn't see you know you didn't see such a squeeze in equity risk premium then you could sort of question whether the analyst expectations and the economists are really getting it right in terms of what the market's pricing in but all of these things triangulate and combine and show the same picture which is very elevated growth expectations in the us um and then uh and then uh sort of a last question here and then we'll have to wrap up thank you all for sticking around uh past the top of the hour but one last question here and we'll wrap up which is a question of basically can the ai boom create uh you know a strong uh economic uh set of conditions uh you know into what we saw in the late 1990s and what i'd emphasize there it really comes down to productivity uh and uh in order to get a low inflation or falling inflation strong growth environment we have to have a significant increase in productivity and the truth is predicting productivity uh is a challenging task for any macroeconomic investor certainly any macroeconomic investor o looking at it over say a five or 10 year period um what i'd emphasize is the uh or to give some perspective you know the essentially the biggest productivity boom that we've seen from technological innov innovation in the post-war period was the introduction of the personal computer and that added something like one to one and a half% real gdp growth on an annualized basis say starting in the late 80s and moving up into the late uh 90s uh that kind of gives you a sense it was paired with huge amounts of business investment uh that was necessary to get uh the the tech the original tech boom uh to occur if we look at what going on today the orders of magnitude are quite a bit smaller the amount of investment that's being discussed uh you know on a global basis related to ai is in the tens or you know or low hundred billion dollars which is di minimus on a global basis and the main question is what is the productivity enhancement so you know so the second order effects of supporting gdp growth are relatively modest uh certainly compared to the magnitudes that we saw during the the let's call it the tech boom number one uh and then the second question is what are the productivity enhancements and that is much more ambiguous question where i think we've got to look at the story and be um you know it's you could be a techno optimist you could be a techn pessimist but i think what you have to be is a realist in terms of looking at the data understanding the data and seeing what it's telling you so far there is no indication that there is a significant support to us worker productivity coming from uh from ai related technologies now that may change in the future and you should be open-minded to that possibly changing in the future but as an investor you also have to be open-minded to the fact that it may not be nearly as significant as what a techno optimist might say and so um so that that's the nubby question i think you know it's very hard to understand very hard to to know whether it's likely to move in one direction or another so that's why it's so important to be grounded in daya when you're looking at what's happening with that um thank you so much to everyone for joining us this month really appreciate uh you spending a little bit of your week with us uh and asking all these questions and uh look forward to speaking with you all next month uh at in our uh july macro webinar have a have a great june
Bond Market Repricing and Recession,2024-06-14 12:15:02+00:00,6,DxA-Qurqoro,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxA-Qurqoro,this this interest rate environment and this all of these things that we've talked about today what do this in turn mean for the bond markets in these developed countries especially on the long end yeah so there we've seen over the course of the year a bit of uh a repricing and recognition here of the fact that we're probably not going to see the magnitude of cuts that we hoped for coming into 2024 and that sort of repricing has brought bond markets uh higher and the pushing out of cuts has brought b brought yields in aggregate higher though that's mostly been a reflection of uh of the fact that um people's shift people shifted their expectations of growth so like coming into the into you know into 24 in the us actually growth expectations were less than 1% real growth over the course of the year um which is pretty weak in the scheme things and that's now shifted and you know economist expectations which you know aren't perfect but kind of give you a sense as to what people are thinking are now that growth in in the second through fourth quarter is going to be above 3% real 3% real growth in the us economy right now is pretty strong um you know i'd say that that's quite a healthy growth rate um that's mostly been that shift is has was in part what drove equities higher uh but now expectations are very elevated um and it's a what in part drove you know the the two-year interest rate to be higher than where we were when we started off the year the short end of the curve the long end of the curve is very interesting uh is interesting um i i think in part because um we still haven't uh while yields have moved up it's mostly been a function of the repricing of short rates not really a repricing of what we call the term premium so that's the uh the amount of of uh expected return that receive from holding longer term bonds relative to shorter term bonds and that has really that's typically driven by um sort of the big picture macroeconomic environment in terms of expectations of growth and inflation and you know right now still remains basically at a 15-year average level um at depending on your model roughly a zero uh term premium in bonds and that's unusual uh considering the fact that you know growth today is a lot better than it has been in much of the last 15 years um and inflation is certainly elevated to where it's been in the last 15 years and so that's really the place where you haven't fully seen the repricing of higher growth and inflation expectations get priced into the markets i think in part because people are looking at nominal yields and saying those nominal yields look pretty high relative to what i know um and i think in part the fact that that the rest of the world has been a bit weaker is creating a lot of demand from those investors for higher yielding us bonds though that has starting to fade as those economies are not nearly as weak as what people have expected so what do you think explains how the us avoided a recession in the last year like many were predicting and and what is that how do you see that resilience going forward well i think it really comes back to that uh that that income driven dynamic um and income driven cycles i think too many people thought we were in a credit cycle and didn't recognize that we were in an income cycle income driven cycle um and so they looked at the sharp rise in short-term interest rates in particular and said hey look we've got to have a recession because whenever there's a rise in rates typically we have a recession and that's totally right in a credit driven uh uh expansion but we had this um we had this this income driven expansion which you know we could it's it's um the reasons for which we've we've talked about already to some extent and that created a lot of resilience it's a you know we have a very resilient us economy i think in part because of the you know we had a big restructuring of particularly households and businesses following the global financial crisis um where you know borrowing is just much less of a big part of the day-to-day equation in terms of how people finance their spending and so that's created a lot of resilience the annoying thing for the fed is it's created a lot of resilience but it's also created much less sensitivity to monetary policy and so what's happened is it's almost like uh you know the flip side of the benefit is the challenge for the for the fed and so i think that's basically what we've seen and been an important driver of that and part and and i probably would would um would be remiss not to at least acknowledge that part of the reason why we could get to this income driven expansion was the fact that there was so much fiscal uh interion in the covid period in the postco in the immediate postco aftermath that helped bridge that gap in terms of incomes between a period where prices rose a lot and until incomes caught up income growth started to catch up and so that put us on a path to then get you know over the that was over course of a couple years which then put us on a path to then be able to have this income driven expansion that we've seen mhm
Why is 2% the Target Inflation Rate? (or why is some inflation good?),2024-06-13 12:15:05+00:00,8,xVcqCG45K7U,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVcqCG45K7U,"so you know when we think about that mandate bob obviously we we most people should know that that the inflation target is 2% why is this why is this the target why is you know a 2% destruction of your purchasing power per year why is that the target yeah i think it's a really good question um and one that um that is it's not arbitrary i think some people will look at that and say 2% it's arbitrary and i think that that's not quite right like the idea of the 2% target and to be clear really what it's intended to be by design is a one to 2% target is that um is that you want to have a little bit of inflation in an economy in order to prevent a deflationary debt spiral dynamic which you know is the sort of thing that we saw in japan and and what that means is you know if we have a circumstance where say prices are deflating and you have debt it means that your income you know debt is fixed in terms of nominal value and incomes typically rise over time and so if what happens is your incomes are falling and your debt stock is staying the same in terms of its valuation that creates a squeeze on you right your your debt burdens are outpacing your income it also has a growth impact which is you know if you knew say you you were thinking about uh buying an iphone right and you were like hey look i know that the same the iphone i can buy it for $1,000 today or i can wait a week and buy it for $750 well what would you do i mean you know your time value of money is such that you would clearly wait a week to save 250 bucks now that's a stylized example but it's the sort of thing that creates a concern in an economy if you have a persistent deflationary dynamic which is people will delay purchases on expectations of future lower prices and that is un that bad so you want to have just enough inflation to prevent those two main points from occurring in an economy over time and so that's where you want a slightly positive inflation rate and you want to be able for it to move around you know because sometimes oil prices go up and they go down and so you want a little bit of wiggle room above zero the main issue about the main thing is you what you don't want to have happen is you don't want to have it go you know so high that it starts to create uncertainty about what future inflation is and this is a bit of a mind game uh and so it's not you know it's not it's less it's less of a of a uh a principle in fact the way those deflationary dynamics are and more of a question of how do people respond and the reality is if you look back through time over the course of the last hundred years what tends to happen is that price the rate of price rise increases of 1 to two per. typically people don't meaningfully change their behaviors as a function of that or or demand higher risk premiums on investment as a function of that but when you start to get something like three or four or five that's when you start to see uh behavioral aspects where inflation expectations start to become a much bigger driver of people's economic behavior and you can see that empirically in how the correlation between stocks and bonds starts to change as you go from moderate inflation modest inflation 1 2% to 3 to 4% you can also see that you can observe that in the experience in the sense of um the odds if you get it you know the odds if you have inflation at say 3% or 4% the odds that you get inflation at 5% or 6% or actually relatively high given the higher you have inflation the more volatility the more likelihood you have you know even more elevated inflation and so that is that's really what you're trying to avoid so you know you you bring up this idea of deflation and you know when we think about the how that would change the time preference for how people use their currency it doesn't seem to me that if you wait you know a week it'll be $250 less if you wait two weeks it'll be half as much you know there's there's going to be a point at which you need to buy that phone and there's also going to be a point at which the phones won't be able to be produced for that um that price so you know inherent in that i i feel like there is uh a floor somewhere that that is going to need to be met by both the producers and the consumers and i don't in my mind it doesn't really mak sense that we we should be so scared of deflation from a consumer aspect but yet why is why are central banks and and in these developed countries so afa afraid of deflation itself well i think part of it is the the first point around the debt the income and debt dynamics is it's probably the biggest risk um if you're sitting in the in the um in the state of a central banker because that creates a negative reinforcing cycle where um you know incomes are too low relative to debts which makes uh borrowers less credit worthy which gets debt pulled which raises the cost of borrowing which creates a harder time you know even more pressure on debts and debt service etc etc and so that i think is probably from a central bank's perspective the the the most concerning point and in fact i think if we were in a circumstance that that um that you're alluding to which is if we had a productivity driven disinflationary environment let's say that i think you know i think a lot of uh i think there's there's good reason to believe that that could be an acceptable state or outcome at least for a period of time where in that case that would the productivity part of it would actually resolve the debt risk because what would happen is incomes would rise prices might fall but incomes would rise relative to existing debt stocks and so you wouldn't have that debt deflation spiral dynamic that might occur now you you could of course still have a of the delayed spending thing uh going on and and and and as you say that's that does exist in the economy like i don't know think about televisions or whatever like sometimes you you know you'll wait for the next model year or whatever cars just things like that in order to get you know slightly lower cost or on on a honic adjusted basis a better product for the same cost or a lower cost and so it's not necessarily clear that that is uniquely terrible in a uniquely bad in a uh in a prod it a positive productivity driven environment mhm"
"Elevated Inflation Persists in Developed Countries (Europe, U.S. and UK)",2024-06-12 12:15:01+00:00,3,bw62x7J1Zhw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw62x7J1Zhw,maybe we could start by speaking about your views on how inflation is still too high in most developed countries yet to justify a meaningful cutting cycle so how is elevated inflation yet in europe the uk and the us well we've gone through an interesting period here where basically you know we had a lot uh you know there's covid there were supply shocks related to covid um there was an elevation of price growth as a function of those supply shocks and in general developed world economies created you know provided some sort of stimulation some sort of fiscal support so that spending could continue despite the fact that uh you know prices were rising much faster than wages but we've sort of settled into a point you know over the you know that was really 2020 2021 and a little bit of early 2022 in the last two years we've really settled into a point where wages have finally caught up with price growth wage growth with price growth if anything are a bit positive more than price growth and um and are growing at a relatively elevated pace certainly relative to pre-co levels you know depending on which economy you pick you know it might be one two three or four percent higher on a nominal year-over-year growth rate than pre-co rates and that's coming at a time when the structural productivity of most developed economies hasn't really changed much since co i mean there there's hope and and i don't want to diminish the fact that it's certainly possible that 10 years from now we'll look back at ai and other and other automation strategies and say that was a a great innovation it's not in the data really today in a meaningful way and so you have basically a lot of nominal wage growth not too much productivity growth and the reality is the gap between those two things is basically has to be what structural price growth is which is you know if i pay somebody a certain you know if someone's nominal wage is growing at a certain pace and they're you know per hour let's say and their output per hour is growing at a meaningfully slower pace then the gap between those two things basically has to be resolved through changes in prices and so that's essentially what we're seeing across the developed world you know in the us we've had flat productivity for the last couple of years and nominal wage growth is growing at you know four or five percent depending on how you think about it um you know you've had uh the same is true in in europe you know three to 4% wage growth flat productivity the uk actually wages growth is even higher and so it's not surprising that we're seeing inflation that continues to be elevated relative to what um you know relative to what those central banks targets are and so and that that without resolving sort of that core thing either productivity has to rise or wage growth has to slow in order to resolve the structural inflationary pressures or we sort of stay here where we're at which is you know it's not like inflation the way it was two years ago but inflation is still above where those central banks uh mandate exists
Employment and Spending Indicators To Consider (For insights into the Economy),2024-06-11 12:15:03+00:00,6,Qi1SGF02x4Y,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi1SGF02x4Y,so what kind of stuff do you should we look or does one would you look for i mean the obvious being you know jobless claims they've kind of gone nowhere non-firm payrolls i mean that's kind of volatile right uh jolt um with level what are what are what are good leading indicators for this income signs of this income thing might be yeah i mean i think that that's part of the story is you just gota you know um we could go down the list and you outlined them pretty well uh about all the different ways in which you can think about um uh the the employment situation uh at any one time and what i'd say is you sort of want to look at all of them like i think people get a little hung up on well i'm you know i only look at the the the claims data or i only look at the jolts or i only look at this like all of it paints a picture together and so wait hold on even adp payrolls i would say even adp payrolls which are a bad indicator of actual payrolls right but what they what are they they're just you know it's just another data source and if anything i would argue that adp payrolls in some ways is more real than any other thing because they actually whatever they pay 20% of americans and so um you know that and they're using their data where they're actually paying 20% of americans and if they started to pay a lot less uh americans then i would start to you know i'd pay attention to it at least um payrolls has its own issues and the household survey has its own issues and so all these things every single day every single piece of data has issues and so what you want to do is you what you're trying to get is sort of a composite understanding of what is it all saying to you and the basic picture is right now if you look across all of it is employment has moderated employment growth is moderated uh and wage growth has moderated a little bit as well and so you put that together and that means income growth in aggregate it's not quite as hot as it was a year or two ago but certainly not very weak you know in in the line to s support a sort of fiveish percent nominal growth economy and you know that's kind of where we are which you know again is is kind of a hard uh it's a hard sell on twitter where you're like well it's uh it's not too hot you know it's not it's not screaming hot but it's also not a disaster it's like it's like fine you know it's a f yeah okay have you seen any kind of like alternate data sources anything you know the satellite imaging or whatever or anything like that that that isn't watched by all major market participants by the broader market that you think might be has exciting potential as far as being a leading indicator for income yeah i i i guess um it's a little it's not quite income it's on the spending side i do think the the card data is generally a good credit card data the various credit card data jp morgan has a really nice um has a really nice series that they do which is uh drawn from their you know the chase credit card business is like a hu you know it's a huge credit card business bank of america also does a survey so i like to look at a couple of them um because uh they bank of america can be a little wonky sometimes um but it gives you you know it gives you sort of that sense if if uh if spending was really falling off of a cliff um those data and you know uh both of them will print daily information um and so you know you can get you can get obviously very very timely information you have to be a little careful about reading too much into the day-to-day chop but um but that's good the other pieces of information i always like to look at um which is not really sort of comprehensive related to wages but it's but it's related to spending is things like open table daily reservations the tsa uh checkpoint numbers which actually made new highs over the past weekend um those are those are uh you know they're not they certainly aren't covering the entirety of the economy but they um you know there's if you were having a broader slowdown um you'd start to see those things start to soften uh ahead of other activities since they're sort of on the edge edge of the sort of discretionary spending profile uh of of households as well as businesses obviously a lot of the tsa travel is is business oriented as well sure yeah if that would happen then you would not have these horrible memorial day traffic like you had this weekend yeah i'm glad i flew nowhere nowhere over memorial day weekend because uh it sounded terrible yeah i didn't fly either but i had to drive from new york to connecticut and back and it was awful took twice as long as normally does anyway uh but you know small first world problems but
Is 2024 Another Tech Bubble?,2024-06-10 12:15:05+00:00,9,Xq4dD6uHECo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq4dD6uHECo,hm people like to bring up the early 2000s with a tech bubble and everything like that uh do you see parallels to that that ended spectacularly it did it certainly did um that's where i uh i cut my teeth as a as an investor was in the tech bubble um investing in cash right near the top and then pulling my money out of cash and buying stocks when stocks had gone down 30% thinking it was a great deal which was not a great deal um as a young investor uh you know sort of bubble type dynamics that existed there like it's it's pretty different today like the companies that are you know valuations are elevated that's certainly true and they're elevated relative to bond yields um but there's not the sort of excesses that existed in that time frame i mean you know believe it or not whatever nvidia has got the earnings it's got or at least you know it's printing certain earnings and if they are to be believed you know they're pretty good and the same is true through with you know other big tech firms or you know other top companies these are companies that are generating profits the other thing that's interesting is you go back to that period the tech period a lot of the economic activity was relate you know was basically borrowing finance like a lot of companies were borrowing a lot to invest in you know tech infrastructure and things like that rather than investing on a free cash flow and that's pretty different today too where we have you know business borrowing is basically at recession like lows and companies that want to borrow and and do investment um in ai or whatever else they want to do are mostly doing that out of free cash flow and so that's just like a much more sustainable environment much more plausible environment it doesn't mean that um you know nvidia 1100 is a great deal or will give you a great return over the next you know 20 years given the current valuations all it means is like the sort of acute downturn self-reinforcing downturn dynamic that existed back in the tech bus boom and bust is probably not going to be present in this period yeah yeah i mean to your point i mean nvidia has not just earnings but they have you know a full order book right and every quarter they blow away what what the already rais guidance was and the dot some of these companies that came public in the early 2000s forget earnings i don't even think they had revenues right yeah i mean yeah it's it's it's hard uh think people forget how how crazy it was in the in the period crazy i mean the prices went up a lot but all but probably more importantly crazy in the sense of there were a bunch of companies that essentially had no earning potential at all you know mostly what we do with those companies today is we put them into the venture pipeline and they die by the time that they get to the ipo world and you know versus back then you know companies were iping very early on no revenue and a lot of hope yeah yeah those were the dat yeah hopefully we won't see that again but yeah so what is driving this if it's not credit expansion is it the consumer is it tech all the above yeah well i think i think that the you know the story is a bit of um you know it's a bit old old timey in the sense of um you know if if people earn income and they spend it you know that's a sustainable thing um and i i think people often will say well that there's no price there's no price wage spiral it's like yeah of course there's no price wage spiral in terms of what's going on right now it's it's much sort of simpler than that like if you study um if you study sort of toy economies uh you know um one of my favorites is the p studying the pw camp economies uh of world war ii this type of dynamic that we're seeing today is actually very similar to what would exist there which is that cigarettes were their money and people would basically would earn income cigarette income um by let's say they provide a service one person would cut hair one person would make coffee one person would make tea one person was a cobbler and how you know how's it possible that economic activity occurred when you know essentially the money supply was fixed and there was no credit and the answer is people's income right which is you know the guy cut the hair and got his cigarettes and then went to the cobbler got his shoes fixed the cobbler got a cup of coffee and that was you know and that was someone's income and that's basically how works and it doesn't mean there's a spiral it doesn't mean inflation's out of control it just means there's a functioning economy where that transition of one person's spending becomes another person's income is a very sustainable dynamic that can play out through time yeah and the american consumer in particular has been very robust you know going back to covid and keep keep uh spending more you know the numbers keep going up if you look at retail sales what do you make of there's been some some story in the media and elsewhere social media about the they've been citing some earnings and mcdonald's and starbucks especially about how this is an indication of of slower of slowing consumer spending and actually today i just saw i i've my counterargument to that has been that the travel industry is doing great but just now i saw that um american airlines is talking about a slowdown so anyway what do you make of all that those type of things that look kind of anecdotal but or maybe even company specific yeah i i often find it hard you know mcdonald's feels like a huge company or whatever but like you know it's not that big a deal at an economy-wide level it's not that big a deal like you know the number of haircuts in the economy matters more than mcdonald's um and so uh and we're not like you know going over to super cuts and checking and doing anecdotal studies of how many people are in the chairs you know maybe we should yeah and maybe we should um and i think it really comes down to that um that you that that's why you really do have to look at this sort of stuff on a on a top down basis i think one of the challenge for a long time for many cycles there was sort of this natural ordering which is like you know you saw certain um certain sectors you know start to weaken and then that leads to the next sector and the next sector and the next sector and part of the reason why that was was because when you had a credit driven economy the most credit sensitive sector started to slow which was an indication that overall credit was likely to slow which then created the second and third order consequences in the economy and so people sort of got that i me it's the reason why why do people look at ism manufacturing it's uncorrelated to actual manufacturing activity it's because for a period of time it was the survey was more correlated to manufacturing activity and it led because you know spending on big ticket goods financed by credit was an early sign of what the overall economy looked like and so a lot of folks if you just like sort of engage if you just look at how people are engaged with data and information is they're they're looking for the thing that is the leading thing and in a income driven cycle the leading thing is actually counterintuitively the income not the spending right so if you have the income then you have the income to spend and distortions in terms of the mix of what you spend on can often be uh more important for any idiosyncratic line item than the aggregate spending dynamic and so if you want to understand how people are going to spend in aggregate at the economy wide level you have to understand the income because they're spending out of their income and then how exact you know whether they go to i don't know mcdonald's or subway or you know take a flight on american airlines or whatever um you know that that just comes down to the particular preferences that they have in terms of their spending mix um and you know i'd say on top of it i think a lot of people you know if american airlines came out and said you know things are going to be largely consistent with what we expected you know like no one would pick up that story too right you know so naturally people are trying to find weakening parts of the economy and they think because they're trying to get a lead and that idea of a lead isn't really working it's more just a composition mix m the
The Fed Policy and Recession,2024-06-07 12:15:02+00:00,5,YB3ly-wSjQU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB3ly-wSjQU,yeah i think the fed has has given people a lot of a lot of head fakes through the course of you know the last couple of years in particular constantly worrying about uh whether there would be a crisis ahead and so always sort of uh giving guidance on the likelihood of cuts at a time when essentially they respond to the actual data that they see and so you know i think uh it's easy to lose sight of the fact like the fed has not changed monetary policy the fed has not cut right and the fed you know won't cut in the next meeting and probably won't cut in the meeting after that and so like you know we they could say whatever they want k pal can get up there and worry to the cows come home but if pce is above what their target is and rising and you know the unemployment rate is basically stable or very very very slowly meandering up like there's no urgency to cut and they're not going to cut and so that's one of the one of the challenges of this environment is like most investors would do better to literally not listen to the fed and certainly not listen to all of those speakers that are out there which fill the airways and you know make for good content on bloomberg but like otherwise like are totally useless in trading markets and just look at the data and the data has been very clear and the fed response to the data and that's what's been going on yeah yeah and some of these people shooting off their mouths on cnbc and bloomberg are not even voting members this year it's pretty funny like cash car i think he's a f he's one of the i'm not sure if he's i don't even know but he's always out there you know throwing sound bites and i think just today he said that the fed may actually have to or could you know he left open the possibility of rate hik i saw some sound bite to that effect but anyway how far is the economy from going into recession and we thought it was imminent in the first quarter of 2023 well it's now q224 and we're nowhere close we're looking at how far away how when is it well i think i think part of the challenge of thinking about the timing of the economy is i if if kind of everything stays the same right now like interest rates on the short end stay the same interest rates on the long end stay the same we will have this like glacial slowing of the economy that we've basically seen over the last couple of years and you know like we'll we'll uh we'll have long forgotten this conversation by the time the us gets into a recession right and so i think the main question is uh whether there's an whether we get something that accelerates that downdraft you know the downdraft in the economy and in an typically the way that works in a credit driven cycle is that you know credit is booming and eventually kind of ex exhausts itself the combination of tighter monetary policy and just literally the fact that credit is growing so strong starts to slow and that creates a turn in the economy that's relatively acute but we don't have that kind of credit growth here and so we have much more we have a much more income driven expansion and so what's going to change the pace of that behavior is really going to come down to um whether households continue to spend basically out of their income and what we'll determine that is whether households are choosing to save relative to spend and what will ch cause them to save more is basically asset prices will have to go down and what will cause asset prices to go down well it's probably not you know naturally from earnings growth because the economy naturally is like fine it's not you know it's not extreme but you know it might might underperform earnings growth expectations a little bit but that's probably not going to make a big deal difference it's much more likely that interest rates will rise particularly on the long end which will then create the asset price declines which will then increase the savings rate slow the spending and start a more acute cycle and so the answer to your question is is less about um about a time frame because we're just working on time under the current conditions it'll be forever i mean long time till we get a slowdown and much more about ordering which is if we start to get a meaningful rise on the long end which can then start to hit asset prices that's the sort of thing that can accelerate this we saw a little bit last summer and fall but it didn't survive because the fed and treasury backed off if we get back into that sort of cycle that we saw then then the sort of downturn could accelerate
Expectations For The U.S. Economy Have Shifted,2024-06-06 13:15:02+00:00,6,ew05LYqso1Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew05LYqso1Q,"it's great to have you i'm very excited about our conversation it's been about a year and a half since you came on and we optimistic and we're proven right in what was at the time a rather pessimistic period well the tables have turned things are optimistic now so optimistic that we have the stock market kind of going gang busters nasdaq hitting new highs every day it seems nvidia off in the stratosphere somewhere and other ai chip names following along and therein lies the problem potentially i'll let you take it from here yeah i i i think when you're when you think about trading markets the most important thing is to think you have to start with what's priced in and how people and what people's expectations are and what expectations are priced into assets um and uh you know the contrarian podcast is perfect in that sense because in order to generate alpha you have to be contrarian to whatever that expectation is right and so if you look at what's priced into asset markets today uh particularly if you look at what's priced into stock markets and you know growth expectations they're very elevated so we had this long period as you mentioned you know uh where people thought that we were going to you know continuously think that we were going to go into a recession go into a recession go into a recession well basically over the course of the last three or four months that has totally been wiped away and now expectations are are for the us to be basically as strong as it's been over the last you know two or three years for that to continue essentially out for many quarters into the future so for instance if you look at economist expectations which are not a perfect measure but a pretty good indication of what's going on they're for 2024 growth to be at 2.5% well we already know what the first quarter was is you know 1.3% okay well that means that the rest of the year has to be at 3 % 3% real growth 3% real growth for the us economy is very very strong that that's that's going gang busters and on top of it you look at earnings expectations and they're pricing in 177% earnings growth year-over-year by the fourth quarter again you know is that possible sure it's possible but that is very very strong in an economy that's grow only growing at sort of five or six% on a nominal basis and so you put that all together and you say look the the economy you know the expectations are very very high and reflective of that sort of backward looking strength that we've had at the same time you could think about you know the higher rate environment um and the continued sort of um the continued challenges you know that weigh on the economy they are slowly but surely degrading the economy right slowing the economy to some extent so you have this weird dynamic where as the economy is likely to slow ahead because of what has happened in the past expectations are basically as strong as they've ever been yes now the but what can slow up the economy and where is and are we even are there any cracks in the foundation today we had consumer confidence blow away expectation that's just one gauge and it's just a survey but right i think whatever but where where could these are are there any cracks where could they develop what is there to indicate that the economy is going to slow this year or at least not continue its breakneck are we talking about breakneck growth already whatever the growth is yeah well it was you know it was close to break neck growth uh in 2023 and so i think most of us in our professional careers have had have seen basically cycles turn down very rapidly whether it was you know the 2008 crisis obviously co was a shock it was very rapid um or even even the the 2000 you know was a bit of a of a abrupt drop as the as the tech bust started to get going and and i think most of us have an experience what is sort of like traditional cycles uh are ones in which interest rates rise as you know the economy strengthens and gets too hot interest rates rise and then kind of you know it's like death by a thousand paper cuts you know there's one company and the next company and the next company that struggle to roll over their debts or their financing costs a little too high or you know they they don't quite need to do the investment that they expected to do at current yields and so that has second and third order effects or housing you know doesn't crash but it kind of meanders to slowing down and that's really what's going on so when you think about the economy right now it's like where are the cracks there are no cracks meaning cracks in the sense of you know uh chasms that will plunge this economy into a rapid deceleration but instead what we're seeing is just chinks in the armor every day coming in and seeing the next thing and the next thing and the next thing and so when you look at the data what you see is uh you know for an economy that is very income driven we've seen employment go from you know 500,000 jobs a month to 250,000 jobs a month to you know if you average the household survey uh as well as the the uh as well as payrolls you got something that's closer to 150,000 jobs a month going on right now you know that's deceleration you see wages they were 5 and a half% growth on average a earnings and four and a half now we're in the high 3es you know that's a deceleration and so that's the ty type of dynamic i'm talking about one in which if you squint at every data point individual data point you'll like lose track of the fact that we're gradually decelerating but it is true we are gradually decelerating in the us economy and that's likely to persist as long as interest rates remain elevated"
"Inverted Yield Curve, Interest Rates and Govt. Spending",2024-06-05 12:15:06+00:00,6,o6SMKgp7q3Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6SMKgp7q3Q,um the inversion of the yield curve in the past it's been a good predictor of a recession but so far uh it hasn't worked in this cycle why not is that is that part of the covid influence well i think a big part of it is that typically the yield curve is a good indication when credit is uh an expansion in credit is a meaningful driver of uh the economic expansion and in this cycle private sector borrowing you know household borro in and business borrowing has been pretty modest in fact below the level that we've seen at the peak of recessions in previous cycles and so that indicator is just not you know the impact of interest rates on the economy is just much lower in this cycle than it has been in previous ones and so rate related indicators like the yield curve just have been a lot less effective uh and what has been a much better uh indicator of what's going on with economic conditions is employment income growth and frankly asset prices stock prices and house prices which you know have continued to rise yeah yeah okay bob what does all this mean for interest rates where are they headed what three months from now where do you see things well i think interest rates are are uh are particularly important because both economic particularly on the long end i should say because economic activity is pricing off of them and also asset price price off of what's going on with long-term interest rates and there what we see is we see this persistent pressure for for those interest rates to rise um and you know even just this week seeing uh you know an uptick in those interest rates with essentially no economic news no incremental data um you're seeing interest rates sort of continue to be buoyant and move up higher and so i think the combination of the strong economy with which is yet to be fully reflected in the yield on the long end with the continued supply from very high uh us government deficits you put those things together and the pressure really is for long-end interest rates to go higher and that's really important because um higher long-end interest rates are likely to affect a lot of different places in the economy whether it's the equity market which has been soft over the course of the last couple of months house prices with rising mortgage rates um just straight borrowing that you know a lot of people do on the long end for business activities as well yeah how what what is the impact and i don't know how else to descri describe it other than crack but the the government continues to feed money into the system how is that influencing economic growth and the interest rate doesn't it it well i'll just leave it there how is it impacting well it one of the challenges with it is that um it has over time uh a lower and lower marginal support to the economy so you keep borrowing this significant amount of money and you keep spending in an extreme way but that just that's that starts to it it's harder and harder to get incremental growth from that spending and that's what we're seeing uh from the government side of uh of things and so what it does do is it creates a big debt burden right lots of borrowing pressure on interest rates crowding out the private sector's ability to do economic activity and borrow so and and creating a long-term debt burden you know that our our children are going to be dealing with decades from now so that's a reality and and the trade-off is not great such a huge debt burden for such a modest amount of incremental support to the economy you know is not it's not great policy from a macroeconomic standpoint so what i i think what i'm hearing from you bob is that you see the fed doing nothing right now is that right yeah i mean i think many people listen to the words of of central bankers in the fed and think uh that they're going to be very active in changing policy but the normal behavior of central bankers when they've paused interest rates is to do nothing for an extended period of time unless there's a you know an acute crack in the economy and that's basically what's happening the the big picture is the unemployment rate rate in the us is at still at secular lows and asset prices are near high stocks are near highs and um inflation's too high and we all know it that inflation's too high and so you put that together there's not a lot of urgency for them to uh to ease the way that they talked about uh earlier in the year uh so people who are betting on them easing are probably going to be disappointed and that as that dynamic that lack of easing uh that's going to flow through long end and and create a pressure for long end interest rates to rise and so that's really the that's that's really the place to look every day if you're looking at markets and trying to understand what's going on the long end of the bond curve is really the place where the where the action is happening because that's really going to determine how everything else flows out
"Beyond GDP, What is a Better Measure the State of the U S  Economy?",2024-06-04 12:15:00+00:00,5,aJTt8Qq-mlY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTt8Qq-mlY,let's talk about the general economy and the strength economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.3% in the first quarter of 2024 it's down from the initial estimate of 1.6% but i think the the thing that kind of made mega wow is that it's significantly lower than the 3.4% growth pace that we had in the fourth quarter of last year 1.3% in the first quarter does that concern you now really i think there's some some uh some oneoff uh dynamics that are going on in that first quarter number as well as some things that overstated the fourth quarter number if you look you know you're probably your best bet is always to look at maybe it's real final demand um and also nominal final demand because that really tells you what the underlying demand is in the us economy and that's really what powers uh you know growth over the long term and there you see you continue to see consumers you know real consumer demand growing at you know 2 to 3% overall final sales demand you know growing at two to 3% and nominal uh sales uh and nominal demand growing in that five five to six perc range and so that overall picture has basically been the same over the course of the last 24 months what caused the sort of weak number this time was uh some weaker foreign demand uh an increase in imports as well as an increase in inventories so that sort of that that sort of picture is not really um it really overstates the softening that's happened really the underlying economy is mostly not changed okay all right um consumers they they are spending money on goods but a the the growth is really happening on the money that consumers are spending for services is that right that's right i mean there was a significant decline in services demand that happened uh in co and i know if co feels in some ways like a long long since past but we're still feeling the effects of it in the economy you know with services demand not really even yet getting back up to the trend that we were seeing prior to covid and so that's creating this dynamic where um you know goods demand and you might see something like retail sales uh being a little softer uh because what's happening is people are transferring their spending over to the to that services demand whether it's travel or um you know uh other sort of day-to-day service activities that they're experiencing and and so that's still not fully rebounded to trend and so that's giving a real lift to what's going on in the ass service sector of the economy um and that's likely to sort of continue for you know probably another year or so while that normalizes so we're going to see you know services strong and goods demand you know fine but not nearly as strong for an extended period how how much picking and choosing are consumers having to do bob when it comes to how much when when they are spending how much picking and choosing between services and dining and and fuel and and insurance are they having to do well i think for a lot of uh you know a lot of the uh middle class uh consum a lot of the middle class consumer i mean they're really feeling pressure uh from rising prices um and you know many of them are getting some benefit from increases in their wages but the sort of services that they've seen for an extended period of time uh you know that they need um you know you talk about homeowners insurance something like that which is you know considered a service that's being provided those are the sorts of things that are uh rising in price auto insurance is rising in price and a lot of that is um is is those are sort of the fundamentals that people need uh in their day-to-day in order to uh you know to to live their lives that's not uh you know those are not sort of unusual or extraordinary expenses those are the the common expenses that that baseline expenses and so in a lot of ways that strength and nominal demand uh which is you know coming out of some increases in incomes that people are getting that's going straight to those necessities and not really going to the uh to the luxuries that are out there for the vast vast majority of americans
The Fed is Still Waiting on Data,2024-06-03 12:15:00+00:00,4,4fufPIp7dPs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fufPIp7dPs,stock thinking ahead of the close today as concerns about higher for longer interest rates put a damper on investor spirits new york fed president john williams may be easing some concerns saying he expects inflation to start coming down again in the second half of the year for more on the fed's path moving forward want to welcome in now bob elliot unlimited co-founder ceo and cio bob it is great to see you so um why don't we start there bob so you know john williams did make some headlines today he did say inflation is still too high goes on to say bob i don't feel any urgency or need that i i don't feel any urgency or need that we have to make a decision now he said what do you make of those comments bob what do you make of what the f where the fed goes from here well i think uh given all the noise of the commentary uh people often think that the fed is likely to be more active in terms of shifting its policy mix than the reality most central banks when they've been on pause for an extended period of time and aren't seeing meaningful shifts in the macroeconomy uh the way that the is seeing now inflation still a little too high underlying growth still pretty good you know the inclination is to pause and do nothing and gather more information and i think that's basically what we've seen through the whole slew of these fed speakers over the course of the last uh couple of days where basically all of them are pointing to uh the fact that it probably makes sense to just wait and see uh some of them are hoping for lower inflation some of them are maybe concerned that it might be a little bit higher but wait and see is the key uh theme across all of them uh and that means that you know meaningful a meaningful cut cycle is probably not going to happen this year you know it's so interesting about because you know a lot of market participants have sort of come to that view despite whatever fed funds futures are pricing in at one moment or another we talk day in and day out about oh the market is moving on this piece of data that the fed is watching or this fed speak but like a lot of people are talking to are saying it doesn't matter if they cut this year stocks are almost agnostic to the fed at this point is that do you think so for a period of time it looked like uh stocks are agnostic uh particularly at the beginning of the year as rate cuts came out and stocks rallied but the key reason why that happened was that we had a resetting of growth expectations in the economy from coming into the year of below 1% growth to now expectations are uh that growth in the the second through fourth quarter is going to be something like uh 3% each quarter on on an annualized basis that's very very strong growth unlikely that we're going to achieve growth at quite that pace through the end of the year combined with the fact that uh the fed not delivering those cuts is going to put pressure on the bond market discount rates which is also a drag on stocks and so i think we've transitioned i mean really after the first quarter we've really transitioned to a point where a lot of the market action in stocks is really being driven by the bond market market um and and we've seen that you know for the last couple of months
The Fed Responds to Data,2024-05-31 12:15:02+00:00,5,P-scw1g_Mcg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-scw1g_Mcg,but you shouldn't listen to anything that jerome powell or any of the governors have to say at all it will provide you absolutely no value no alpha value uh in predicting what's likely to transpire the fed and and this last three months is three or four months is a such a good indication of that which is the fed responds to the data the fed doesn't respond to their predictions the fed doesn't respond to their guesses the fed responds to the data and so if you want to get a lead on the fed stop listening to what they have to say because they have no idea they have no predictive ability the fed has no predictive ability and so if you want to understand what they're going to do understand what is going on with the data that they use to respond to and even better predict the data that they're going to use to respond and so um when you're thinking about you know how do you interpret what's going on you know i think it's important to connect what is um what is most likely to happen with the data that they're responsive to and so as an example if we went back in you know january i s out an outlook in the beginning of january and i basically said it looks like the macroeconomy is likely to be stronger for longer than what's expected and that's because of combination of different things in part because stocks have gone up a fair amount which was a positive stimulative effect of the economy and interest rates had come down which which essentially was a big financial market easing which would create a re acceleration or or continued strength in the economy and a continued uh elevation of inflation pressures and so that gives you a good example so whatever the the fed said three the market said six to s and when you looked at what was likely to drive the macroeconomic outcomes in the next three or six months it basically looked like zero is the right answer and so that's where that's alpha that's where the alpha opportunity is is understanding the data is likely to transpire not listening to what they have to say now today conditions are quite a bit different in the sense of uh you know essentially the market pricing you always have to start with the market pricing whenever you're betting on markets start with the market pricing start with what's priced in and predict what's likely to transpire relative to what's priced in on the short rate market look what's priced in is basically you know oneish cuts over the course of 2024 are they you know could it be zero could it be two you know who know knows it's not six or seven six or seven you know the easy money's been made i think the mispricing in the short rate market is not that interesting at this point on the margin i think it's probably going to be tighter than what's priced but you know it's a it's a pretty low alpha trade at this point whereas when you look at the overall environment what you see is basically stocks are priced uh in a way that they're reflecting an expectation of continued very strong growth um in an environment where we've had had a meaningful interest rate rise over the course of the last three or six months and this is one of the interesting things that you know which would typically indicate that we're likely to see a slowing but expectations are uh for growth to be as strong as it's been uh you know in the last couple of years despite the fact we've basically had a market-based tightening over the course of the last uh three or four months and so that's those are the sorts of dynamics right you want to think about okay well what's what are the you know the fed is going to decide based upon uh certain data what drives that data what is priced in related to that data and where's their gap between those two things so there's not much of a gap in the short rate market but there's actually a fair amount of gap in the equity market right now and we're seeing basically that dynamic play out where you know equities can't uh you know bond yields are high enough right now where it seems like every day we come in and equities try their darnest to get a bid and they just can't quite get a bid and that's because expectations of earnings growth are very high and because we're experiencing a monetary tightening ahead and so that's really the the more interesting area of the market is the long end of the bond bond market and the equity market much more so than what's going on with short rates
Are Higher Rates Stimulative?,2024-05-30 12:15:00+00:00,4,62YEjEKxJ7s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62YEjEKxJ7s,so david idorn said recently that higher rates are actually stimulative um you know people have higher incomes and firms have lots of cash sitting on the balance sheets uh you know which is resulting in an in increase in interest income so what do you think about this theory uh generally and what it might mean for you know the outlook of the economy and for risk assets yeah well i think it's a theory proposed by people who aren't doing the uh rigorous analytical work to assess the quantities of of what is influenced by interest rates let's just take the basic simple example of just the income side uh of the the story um in order for higher interest rates to influence economic activity that income growth that income earned has to translate into gdp impact most of the debt assets held by you know held in the us are held by non-dp creating entities pension funds endowments foreign central banks right businesses for whom their primary reason for operating or the primary business decisions are related to you know macroeconomic or uh cyclical circumstance not related to the amount of income that they're earning on their bank deposits and so the first most important point is that there's a lot of talk about all this income but you know with with very little care to understanding that connection quantifying that connection to actual gdp effect and even those like households who have a gdp effect those who are earning that income you know what do the rich people do when they earn the income on their t- bills you know does that meaningfully affect their spending uh the answer is no right because their propensity to spend versus save is very different from those who would likely spend from higher wages and so you put that all together just on on its face the idea that it's a meaningful driver of spending doesn't hold up to the common sense test now let me also say that you have to weigh higher interest rates against the negative effects that higher interest rates have on the economy related to increased borrowing uh which clearly there's a very direct impact on increased borrowing just look at bank bank balance sheets and how much borrowing has slowed since interest rates have risen and also the effect on asset prices the incremental effect on asset prices where higher interest rates you know bring down or a negative impact on asset prices on the margin and you put that all together and basically anyone there's no way to make a quantitatively driven case that's based upon you know fundamental uh factors where this idea holds any water it's not even close right it's not close um and i think you know often these things are sort of vaguely proposed by you know disconnected uh uh you know folks who are sort of you know out there kind of professing general ideas rather than people who are literally doing the work to quantify whether or not um it makes sense right so stay away from disconnected luminaries like like vaguely speculating and focus on people who are adding up the numbers and doing the the quant quantification necessary to make the assessments right so we'll finish off i think with two questions related i have nothing against david i don't even know davidor from anybody i'm just saying that's a very popular theory that's out there that just doesn't hold water if you do the work to really understand it
The Bonds are in The Stocks,2024-05-29 12:15:03+00:00,5,WYk0HUN5OZI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYk0HUN5OZI,the rise in the yields in the long end i want to explore that further because the implications for other asset classes what that could mean let's just like frame it up and then um flush it out yeah so uh uh very often people when they think about um long-end bonds they don't they don't really realize that long-term interest rates are basically uh embedded in every asset price that exists and and the reason why that is at some levels relatively simple i'm sure we all remember our you know uh dividend discount models or our you know our dcfs uh from uh from when we were first learning how to think about markets and and pricing out companies and things like that and and that is uh that sort of framework is pertinent because what is a company all a company is is a future streaming cash flows that get discounted back to today and what that means is that long-term interest rates are a critical component of that discounting factor and so you have circumstances we've seen this a couple times in the last two years where once expectations of future growth uh start to be pretty strong which they are now and they were for instance last summer once you sort there's sort of a limit of how strong uh earnings growth is likely to be or how strong the economy is likely to be and so once that gets priced in and is reflected in the level of stock prices then what ends up happening is the long-term interest rate moving around starts to become a bigger driver of what's going on because people are already expecting strong growth the question is how much is that strong growth going to be discounted in order to to define what the price is of of the stocks for instance and so the bonds are in the stocks and the bonds become the big driver of the market that's really what we've seen a big transition has occurred in the asset markets in the last six weeks in the first three months of the year what we saw was stocks and bonds were trading uh opposite to each other so stocks were going up and bond yields were rising meaning bond prices were were falling as stock prices were rising but once expectations of us growth started to reset from pretty weak coming into the year to pretty high by the begin by the end of last quarter what started to happen was that bonds and stocks started to trade in a way that was positively correlated to each other reflecting the fact that the discount rate is now the primary driver of what's going on in asset returns and so every day we come in and it's like what's going on with stocks well just tell me what's happening in the bond market i can tell you what's happening with the stocks and so that's what's going on the long end is the critical driver of asset prices right now and i think one of the key risks that exists in the market is that pressure that continuous pressure on the bond market on the long end of the bond market through persistent issuance by the federal government driven by very large deficits that's creating a risk that those that the long end of the bond market continues to be pressured higher at a time when you know the stock market is very sensitive to how the bond market moves would you say would that be like one of the biggest risks for you today that that dynamic well i think for equity investors um the biggest risk is that uh that that the economy remains too strong which then creates pressure on the bond market so in many ways the expectations that are embedded say you know uh you know the stock market isn't the economy but no economists estimates of or expectations of 2024 growth are now at 2.5% they came into the year at less than 1% now they're 2.5% that's very strong well if we have growth at 2.5% and inflation that continues to be elevated those dynamics combined with a significant supply on the long end coming from the federal government on an ongoing basis that's going to probably pressure bond yields higher and so that's on net bad for stocks not good for stocks because the the long end of the bond the long end of the bond curve is just so critical to pricing the equity market at at this point yeah okay so when you look at like
Understanding the Current Economic Cycle,2024-05-28 12:15:02+00:00,8,YI0oDhA-dOo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0oDhA-dOo,with the core idea that um the the cycle that we're seeing today is very different than the cycle than that we've experienced the cyles we've experienced over the course of our professional careers and so they require uh the ability to sort of step back and really deeply understand um not the the fact that the dynamics that are driving them are unusual to us but actually quite usual quite common when you think about how uh business cycles have and expansions have occurred you know across countries across time which is that core idea of an income le expansion has a lot of second and third order consequences when it comes to monetary policy asset prices um what's likely to transpire with uh with you know unemployment inflation etc and so i think that's the main gap and and and i see it all the time i see it for instance if you read you know what the fed writes uh neil kari came out with a with an essay that basically is like i think monetary policy is tight but growth doesn't seem to be slowing down um you know somewhat confused i think by the cycle that we're seeing and i think a lot of investors are confused by it but if you if you reframe your thinking from credit driven expansions or a fiscal driven expansion to instead one that's a traditional income driven expansion it's going to be very very helpful in framing and understanding what matters and what doesn't okay let me ask you one thing before you go because that that i'm it see it confuses me too and i imagine it confuses a lot of folks as you point out so why do you think it is confusing like where do you think if you had to kind of pinpoint where that comes from or what that is what do you think it is well i think the main thing that's confusing is um we've had cycles where inevitably excesses emerge and where monetary policy is effective at in excesses so if you think about like the 06 to 08 you know housing cycle housing bubble driven cycle right we had huge credit growth which got to a point where um where it was totally unsustainable you know like people were taking out greater than 100% ltv loans with no doc financing you know that didn't have jobs like that's the sort of thing it you got to a point where there's so much debt creation that it was unsustainable that was going to continue and you had a circumstance where the fed's tightening the raising of interest rates at that time had was relatively effective in slowing that cycle because 50% of the loans were uh were uh financed on the short end or were floating rate loans in one form or another and so that's kind of our our our framework that's the way of our of our thinking but what's happening today is that there is essentially no credit creation occurring uh among households or businesses it's i mean there's not literally zero but we're basically at recession like levels of credit creation already and yet the economy expands and and so that's that's the thing that's confusing is that if you think about the economy through the lens of credit being the driver and you think about the economy uh through the lens of money being the driver right because in the post gfc period you know money creation went up and down and up and down and that drove waves uh in in the in asset prices in the macro economy but again what's happened in the postco period is uh in the last couple of years is that uh asset prices are going up the economy is strong and money creation is negative right and so what that highlights is it's not money creation it's not credit creation it's something different it's a different type of financing of an economic expansion and it's a is it is in many ways the oldest type uh of financing of an economic expansion if you just go back to periods where money supply was constant and where there weren't well-developed banks how did to get business cycles well someone started spending and they handed it to somebody and was somebody's income and that person started spending and they handed to somebody somebody's income and that's a natural that's not a spiral i think too often people go oh you mean there's a spiral it's not a spiral it's just a rein a self-reinforcing mechanism it's not a spiral upwards or downwards it's a it's a reinforcing mechanism a sustainable reinforcing mechanism that can continue for an extended period of time and that's exactly what we're seeing is not credit not money money um even the fiscal story which really mattered right after covid you know we've had actually a fiscal contraction over the last three years and nonetheless we continue to see growth continue to plug along pretty well and we continue to see asset prices rise and it's all around that income point so i also take it no recession ahead or at least not anytime soon well i think the main thing on the on on that idea is um in order to get you have to ask yourself what do you have to get in order to get a recession uh and if it's not credit growth slowing down and if it's not money growth slowing down then what you have to do is you have to you have to get that income growth that's happening you have to get people to spend less of that income and how does that work well the way that they spend less of that income is they get scared they you get scared that you have to save more and spend less and so how does that happen well the key way that that happens uh is through asset prices fall and so how are so because you know as long as asset prices are going up and you're earning a good wage like you keep spending you know it's very natural that people just keep spending as long you know if you're again if you're a middle class household like your house has gone up 100% in value in the last you know five years your 41k is up you know 50 to 100% in value in the last five years like there's no reason to save right so the question is what creates the incentive to save and what creates the incentive to save is falling asset prices and what creates falling asset prices in this environment is rising bond yields and so that's when you talk about when are we going to have a recession we probably will have a recession it'll happen at some point the question is really the ordering which is you start with uh long-term interest rates have to rise and then that'll hurt asset prices and then that'll hurt spending and then that'll hurt earnings and incomes and then that'll hurt employment and then that'll start to slow wages and then that will create slowing uh a sustainable slowing of demand but the path is that is in that direction right so one has to the ordering matters first bonos have to rise or i mean maybe there'll be an exogenous shock but really first bonos have to rise that's the most you know that's the the most likely way in which this overall dynamic starts to slow and we saw a taste of that last fall but you know bon yels touched five and then they went down and there was a big easing that happened in response and so we did really get that dynamic to play out long enough or high enough or painful enough to start to really shift what's going on with economic conditions and so the question is not really when will uh when will the recession come the question is much more what has to happen to get to the point of recession and the first step of that is bon's after r

what's likely to transpire with uh with you know unemployment inflation etc and so i think that's the main gap and and and i see it all the time i see it for instance if you read you know what the fed writes uh neil kari came out with a with an essay that basically is like i think monetary policy is tight but growth doesn't seem to be slowing down um you know somewhat confused i think by the cycle that we're seeing and i think a lot of investors are confused by it but if you if you reframe your thinking from credit driven expansions or a fiscal driven expansion to instead one that's a traditional income driven expansion it's going to be very very helpful in framing and understanding what matters and what doesn't okay let me ask you one thing before you go because that that i'm it see it confuses me too and i imagine it confuses a lot of folks as you point out so why do you think it is confusing like where do you think if you had to kind of pinpoint where that comes from or what that is what do you think it is well i think the main thing that's confusing is um we've had cycles where inevitably excesses emerge and where monetary policy is effective at in excesses so if you think about like the 06 to 08 you know housing cycle housing bubble driven cycle right we had huge credit growth which got to a point where um where it was totally unsustainable you know like people were taking out greater than 100% ltv loans with no doc financing you know that didn't have jobs like that's the sort of thing it you got to a point where there's so much debt creation that it was unsustainable that was going to continue and you had a circumstance where the fed's tightening the raising of interest rates at that time had was relatively effective in slowing that cycle because 50% of the loans were uh were uh financed on the short end or were floating rate loans in one form or another and so that's kind of our our our framework that's the way of our of our thinking but what's happening today is that there is essentially no credit creation occurring uh among households or businesses it's i mean there's not literally zero but we're basically at recession like levels of credit creation already and yet the economy expands and and so that's that's the thing that's confusing is that if you think about the economy through the lens of credit being the driver and you think about the economy uh through the lens of money being the driver right because in the post gfc period you know money creation went up and down and up and down and that drove waves uh in in the in asset prices in the macro economy but again what's happened in the postco period is uh in the last couple of years is that uh asset prices are going up the economy is strong and money creation is negative right and so what that highlights is it's not money creation it's not credit creation it's something different it's a different type of financing of an economic expansion and it's a is it is in many ways the oldest type uh of financing of an economic expansion if you just go back to periods where money supply was constant and where there weren't well-developed banks how did to get business cycles well someone started spending and they handed it to somebody and was somebody's income and that person started spending and they handed to somebody somebody's income and that's a natural that's not a spiral i think too often people go oh you mean there's a spiral it's not a spiral it's just a rein a self-reinforcing mechanism it's not a spiral upwards or downwards it's a it's a reinforcing mechanism a sustainable reinforcing mechanism that can continue for an extended period of time and that's exactly what we're seeing is not credit not money money um even the fiscal story which really mattered right after covid you know we've had actually a fiscal contraction over the last three years and nonetheless we continue to see growth continue to plug along pretty well and we continue to see asset prices rise and it's all around that income point so i also take it no recession ahead or at least not anytime soon well i think the main thing on the on on that idea is um in order to get you have to ask yourself what do you have to get in order to get a recession uh and if it's not credit growth slowing down and if it's not money growth slowing down then what you have to do is you have to you have to get that income growth that's happening you have to get people to spend less of that income and how does that work well the way that they spend less of that income is they get scared they you get scared that you have to save more and spend less and so how does that happen well the key way that that happens uh is through asset prices fall and so how are so because you know as long as asset prices are going up and you're earning a good wage like you keep spending you know it's very natural that people just keep spending as long you know if you're again if you're a middle class household like your house has gone up 100% in value in the last you know five years your 41k is up you know 50 to 100% in value in the last five years like there's no reason to save right so the question is what creates the incentive to save and what creates the incentive to save is falling asset prices and what creates falling asset prices in this environment is rising bond yields and so that's when you talk about when are we going to have a recession we probably will have a recession it'll happen at some point the question is really the ordering which is you start with uh long-term interest rates have to rise and then that'll hurt asset prices and then that'll hurt spending and then that'll hurt earnings and incomes and then that'll hurt employment and then that'll start to slow wages and then that will create slowing uh a sustainable slowing of demand but the path is that is in that direction right so one has to the ordering matters first bonos have to rise or i mean maybe there'll be an exogenous shock but really first bonos have to rise that's the most you know that's the the most likely way in which this overall dynamic starts to slow and we saw a taste of that last fall but you know bon yels touched five and then they went down and there was a big easing that happened in response and so we did really get that dynamic to play out long enough or high enough or painful enough to start to really shift what's going on with economic conditions and so the question is not really when will uh when will the recession come the question is much more what has to happen to get to the point of recession and the first step of that is bon's after r
Another Nasdaq Record High,2024-05-27 12:15:03+00:00,1,RmMfVh7u5Vo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmMfVh7u5Vo,is growth still so strong that you can be excited about the future as the ai trade would suggest or is it so strong that boy these high rates are going to keep a cap on things going forward well i think that's basically what we've seen over the course of the last couple of months you know the s&p 500 today trading not that much higher than where we were to close out the first quarter and that really indicates the fact that despite the fact that growth is pretty strong and we continue to get strong data points coming in on an ongoing basis we're in this difficult spot where strong growth is leading to pullback of expectations of fed easing which is undermining a bit of the ability for stocks to rally i mean even just this week you had such strength in nvidia which uh and ended up the week flat on stocks overall which highlights the fact that the rest of the market is struggling without getting that easing expectation to get priced in
Inflation Measures and The Fed,2024-05-24 12:15:00+00:00,6,-ZlbLpCHqrs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZlbLpCHqrs,you can think about inflation uh from a couple of different angles one way to look at it is to sort of look bottoms up good by good right how much is services x housing and housing and core goods and oil prices and stuff like that and that can define how to think about uh inflation and what's likely to transpire on the flip side the other way to look at it um is to think about the structural inflation in the economy as a function of what does nominal wage growth look like relative to productivity growth and so as an example if i'm paying someone you know their wages are increasing on an hourly basis by 6% a year and their productive capacity is only increasing by 1% a year well then naturally what has to happen is the difference between that nominal income uh earnings that they're getting that nominal income growth versus the productivity growth in the economy defines what the structural inflationary pressure is because the difference between those two has to be a rise in prices and so i think what we're seeing uh when we're looking at the economy today is that we're seeing that structural inflation dynamic that hasn't really resolved well enough you know wages on an hourly basis are running at maybe a 5% growth rate between four and 5% depending on how exactly you measure it what exactly you measure whereas productivity growth i think there's a lot of promise that uh maybe we'd have a productivity boom uh coming you know as a function of ai and other other actions and the reality is productivity is actually chopped sideways since the covid period the measured productivity in the economy that's output per hour worked and so you look at that you say nominal wage growth at four or five% productivity growth that's most mainly flat the difference between those creates structural inflation in the economy and that is interestingly lining up with what we're seeing on the measured side when you sort of take the bottoms up approach price by price and all of that is just too high for the fed's mandate yeah okay so let's explore that further um inflation it's still way too high for the fed's mandate um even going back to the beginning of the year remember like a lot of folks were expecting what was it like six cuts this year i want to get your tick obviously that's definitely out the out the window um we know that what do what is kind of your thought process on the fed's interest rate policy we've had some interesting guests on this show who even thought that you know maybe we might even see a ility of a hike that that's increased what's your take on um the interest rate policy for you know heading into the summer maybe remainder of the year well certainly if you just looked at a central bank you know in a in a normal circumstance and you said we have a set of conditions where unemployment's at secular lows the growth rate in the economy has been you know at or above potential for seven quarters in a row um and inflation remains elevated uh after a period of being way above what the target is you look at that set of conditions and you'd say that central bank proba at a minimum should be doing you know keeping rates stable and possibly hiking further given that set of circumstances and so i think that uh you know in many ways people look at the fed and they try and read the te leaves on exactly what powell said in this meeting or that meeting and the reality is it doesn't really matter because chairman poell is going to respond to the data and the and the fed is going to respond to the data that they see and so even though they thought that they might cut a lot you know coming into the into the beginning of the year the data hasn't complied they haven't gotten the confidence that they needed in order to behave that way and so what that functionally means is that they're probably going to transition to an easing cycle in a much slower pace than uh than you know certainly was expected at the beginning of the year now does that mean that they're going to transition to hikes i think a little boxed in and i think this is one of the challenges of trying to give forward guidance from a central banker perspective is it really does constrain their flexibility like the hurl to be able to switch to hikes is probably very high meaning you know inflation printing one or two% higher on an annualized rate than what it's printing right now before they would have the e sufficient evidence uh to really start a renewed hiking cycle um and so more likely than not what they're going to do is uh is what many central bankers do uh the actual natural state for a central banker is not to do much the natural state for a central banker is one with great inertia which is to basically just stay put until you find enough information that drives you uh to move in one direction or the other and so i think the most likely circumstances the fed will sort of keep rolling in this in this state right now which is they'll keep collecting more information trying to gain confidence for cuts uh even as inflation prints you know above what their uh what their target is for an extended period of time
"Asset ""Air Pocket""",2024-05-23 12:15:04+00:00,5,TFyxcoizvYY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFyxcoizvYY,yeah well i i think it's it's a bit of a challenging circumstance because um because at the current level of interest rates uh i like to think we're sort of in an airpocket right now which is the current level of interest rates is enough so that when bond yields are rising they are they are hitting stocks because of that discounting effect that i was describing and so stock prices that's why stocks and bonds are trading together in a positive uh in a in a with a positive cor coration and that will probably break that positive correlation will break when you get bond yields up high enough they start to slow the economy because once they start to slow the economy then you'd expect the fed to ease and that's a good time to buy bonds and so but the problem is we're we're ways away you know under current uh under the current level of bond yields uh the economy is doing fine so we've got to get bond yields up higher before we get to the point that the economy has a sufficient drag so that it ends up slowing down so the fed ends up easing and so that air pocket i describe is sort of an asset air pocket where you know at 450 bonds are too high for stocks to keep rallying but not high enough for the economy to slow down you really need bon yields to move into the fives probably to you get to the point where they've moved high enough to create enough of dragon asset prices in the economy to start that easing cycle to actually kick off um and and it's going to be a you know it would be a painful period transitioning from 450 say to 550 for ass for traditional asset prices like socks and boms this is why it's so great having you on i like this description of an air pocket i want to hear a little bit more about the air pocket that we're in and when did we kind of enter this dynamic was that more recently was that like six like we were saying was it not it wasn't like too long ago can you kind of i want to hear more about this air pocket that we're in air pocket air pocket air pocket yeah yeah well i think we we had there was a reason to kick off the year um we were in a we were in a pretty unique position which was expectations of us growth were very weak and we had just experienced the largest financial market financial conditions easing in 40 years in the in the fourth quarter of 2023 so you put those two things together th that was very positive for the for uh for the for the real economy and positive for shift sentiment and so what happened was people went from expecting you know the us economy to be pretty weak in 2024 to now being expecting it to be very strong and bond yields rose consistent with that uh and so you could have a circumstance where stocks outperform bonds and that's exactly what happened uh reflective of that stronger expected growth in the economy but then eventually the bond yields you know the expectations rise enough and the bond yields rise enough so that that starts to flip and that's really where the air pocket exists it's an air pocket between sort of 450 and 550 and i think that's one of the challenges because as you said before it said don't you think people you know at 5% will find bond yields attractive and i think the real question about when do when do bonds become attractive they become attractive at the point in which you think the fed is really going to start easing well so far no signs that the fed is really going to start easing anytime soon there's a lot of hope that they might ease there's a lot of speculation that they might e but the data doesn't align with the fed easing at all and that's the the pain point that that people keep running into which is you keep expecting easing and then it doesn't happen and keep expecting easing it doesn't happen and you don't want to be buying bonds until you get to the point where it's pretty clear that there's a darn good reason to ease well secularly low unemployment not a good reason to ease inflation above expect you know above target meaningfully and getting worse not a good reason to ease there's no good reasons to ease in the market yet and so that's really the air pocket is this sort of uh this point where there is not enough evidence for easing and where asset prices financial asset prices need that easing to re accelerate at this point
The Bond Market is Shaping Other Asset Markets,2024-05-22 12:15:04+00:00,9,XQ8lAcKaeVE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ8lAcKaeVE,when it comes to markets what we see is that you know much of this strong growth and need for tighter monetary policy is largely priced in to a number of financial markets you know equity prices uh have reached uh you know are basically at highs uh expectations of fed cuts have gone from six to seven cuts expected to kick off the year now to roughly one to two um those two markets basically are reflect the strength of the economy the inflationary pressures and the need uh to maintain tight money for an extended period of time the main place that's not reflecting that is in the term structure of interest rates which if you were to you know there's a lot of different ways to measure the term structure of interest rates and the term premium uh and you know you put a bunch of academics in the room and they'll all have their own opinion about it um it it doesn't matter so much exactly how you measure it and what the precise number is what matters more is to kind of get a sense as to what does that term premium that rough term premium look like relative to what it's been say for the last 10 years and how does that compare to how economic conditions look relative to the same period so as a simple example if you take a look at this measure of term premium what you see is that uh you know the current term premium in the bond market 10-year bond market is roughly consistent with uh the average that it's been over the course of the last 10 years 10 or 15 years and that's pretty notable considering the fact that uh if you look at uh the the economic conditions right now uh they're certainly more considerably more elevated relative to how they've been on average over the last 10 years if you look at inflation pressures they're certainly more elevated relative to what they've been in the last 10 years and if you look at uh overall tightness of financial conditions uh you know uh the short rate has been very elevated uh relative to what it's been the last 10 years and so you sort of put all these different pictures together the need for tighter monetary policy for an extended period of time is certainly unusual relative to the last 10 years and so uh stronger growth higher inflation and need for tighter structural monetary policy you put all those things together and the idea that you have essentially the same term premium in place that you did uh over the last 10 years it doesn't quite add up uh in terms of how the long end is priced that's occurring at a time when we're likely to see the long-end supply continue last time we talked there was real questions about exactly what policy would be announced in the qra um and the reality is uh what we got was just basically more of the same and if you look here on the left hand side what you see is a chart of the total amount of notes and bonds that are being issued over the course of the next uh six months or so and what you see here is that that uh that level of issuance is going to continue to be uh significantly elevated not quite uh not quite higher than in in history but um but nonetheless it's going to remain considerably elevated and as a function of that you'll have continued pressure on the bond market uh as that supply continues to flow through that supply if anything is worse than what it's been in a fair amount of the uh postco period because at least back when we had that big supply around covid you had a situation where there was significant bond buying by the by the federal reserve whereas at this point you know quantitative uh tightening continues to create a drag on the bond an ongoing flow and drag on the bond market and when you think about that basic story what ends up happening is that will in one way shape or form that's a essentially the selling of bonds is essentially an ongoing negative flow of capital in or negative flow in terms of asset prices as it represents a continued flow or sale of asset prices on an ongoing basis and so the thing i think is pretty interesting is how asset prices are currently transpiring relative to where we've been uh over the course of the last couple of years and what you see there is uh with that measure of of our part basically asset prices have remained constant uh you know still near highs uh relative to the last couple years they fell as the bond supply question uh came into existence sort of late last uh fall but by and large asset prices have recovered uh what happened last fall and they remain basically at peaks now that's particularly notable because what it means is that um such strong asset prices combined with this significant flow of supply really raises a question about whether we're going to continue to see such strong asset prices ahead the bond supply is going to affect all asset prices in one way shape or form continuing on i think what that really highlights to me is that um you know the the thing that's going on the thing that's going on in ter in terms of the cross asset markets is that the bond market really is in control um the bond market uh you know i think there was a period of time when we were coming into the year where uh expectations of us economic outcomes were quite different uh than um than what was likely to transpire so coming into the year what we saw was that you know expectations of us growth in 2024 were going to be about 1% or lower but then what happened what shifted uh to kick off the year was a big shift in those expectations uh for particularly in the us stock market where today us stocks are now expected to uh have you know earnings growth at something like 177% by the end of the year on a year-over-year basis and economist estimates of economic growth in the us are for us uh economic real gdp to be about 2 and a half% over the course of the entirety of 2024 2 and a half% gdp in this economy is you know pretty strong gdp all things considered and so what you see here is a picture that that sort of got priced in that repricing of the strength of economic conditions got priced in we saw stocks basically move to new highs we saw bond yields move up uh somewhat in response to that but now we've transitioned to a different point in the cycle where what's happening instead is that expectations of strong growth already exist uh in the market and continue to remain in place so what creates the incremental shift in terms of asset prices is not those expectations because they're still firmly in place what creates the shift in expect in in prices is now the discount rate and we see this everywhere across uh across assets so we see in the us stock market basically trading highly correlated to the us bond market in the last couple of weeks we see you know foreign bond markets trading uh tightly uh to what's going on on in the us bond market we see you know the yen trading close closely connected to what's going on in the us bond market and we also see you know assets as extreme as what's going on with bitcoin trading closely to what's going on in the us bond market and so all of those things are indications and you know that that uh bond market connection created a selloff in asset prices in april and then created a rally here uh to kick off the the month of may as bond yield started to to come down and so uh you know i think a lot of folks are focused on what's going on with say earnings or or other dynamics in the market but what's really driving the moves in asset prices are uh are what's happening with the long end so the long end is really in control and in control globally
What Are the Elements of An Income Led Economic Expansion?,2024-05-21 12:15:04+00:00,9,yJGYysFCo_c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGYysFCo_c,what we have here uh as a result of the tight labor markets so strong growth tight labor markets uh elevated wage growth is that uh we have what i i'd call an income expansion uh that's pretty different from most of the uh expansions that we've seen uh during our professional careers during most of our lifetimes uh who are probably uh on this call right now most of the time we've seen credit driven expansions so whether it was in the 2008 period or uh the the tech boom period in both of those periods uh economic activity expanded as a result of either households or businesses taking on substantial debt and using that to finance uh their their spending or their investment in the economy and when that flow of credit slowed in part as a function of tightening monetary policy that then created a really significant ific slowdown in economic activity as booming credit went to slowing credit the story today is totally different credit growth in the us economy uh across the non-financial sectors uh is running basically at recessionary levels uh at you know roughly a couple percent of gdp uh on an annualized basis and what that suggests is despite the fact that we're having relatively low credit growth we're having pretty strong spending growth uh particularly from the household sector and so how can that be well the way that that works is that we're having an income le uh expansion and so here on the le- hand side what you see is the total compensation of employees received this from the personal income and spending report and what it shows is that uh the overall household wage and salary income growth is running about five or 6% and then it's notable which is elevated relative to what it's been in the last you know 25 years give or take and then you go over to the right hand side and you look at the spending side of things and you see well spending is running it at uh five to six per. and so what you basically have is a very sustainable dynamic because if households are basically taking in a certain amount of wage growth and growing their spending in line with that wage growth that's something that can continue for an extended period of time because it doesn't have the sort of buildup debt dynamics that would typically occur in a credit le expansion you don't have that unsustainable debt boom uh that eventually starts to slow significantly as monetary policy tightens and a lot of there's been a lot of conversations about other dynamics uh that are predominantly driving uh the story i think folks who have sort of been brought up really focused on on the idea of a credit driven cycle are confused about how about why the the overall gdp growth remains so strong in an environment where there's relatively tight monetary policy and relatively low credit growth and so those folks are searching for solutions searching for ways to describe or possible ideas in terms of how to describe what's going on uh in terms of what's financing the spending one of the most po theories that has emerged over the course of the last couple of months has been that elevated interest rates are leading to elevated income uh for the holders of those assets which is then leading to elevated spending lo and that theory does not simply doesn't hold up when you actually do the numbers so on the left-and side upper leth hand side what you see here is the total household interest income earned uh through time relative to overall nominal gdp growth in the us economy those two charts are put on different levels because uh they're different meaningfully different levels but the scale sizes are the same so you can compare the magnitude of the changes between uh the two series and what you see is uh the overall household interest income that is being earned has has risen but it is a tiny tiny uh rise in comparison to overall nominal gdp and if anything think this probably overstates the story since the vast majority of households that are earning interest income are higher income cohorts with lower propensity to spend that incremental earned income on the right hand side you see the same story basically from a corporation perspective where elevated rates particularly for large cashh holding uh businesses large businesses with with substantial cash holdings have uh have more than offset the increase uh in overall financing costs because they've locked in long-term debt at low interest rates but again the overall picture the amount of uh in interest income that has has uh has occurred as a function of that activity is dem minimus relative to the overall moves and gdp growth finally you look at the bottom another way to triangulate it is looking at how the government says how much are they paying to households and corporations as a function of their um activities you know as function of their ongoing interest payments and again what you see there is a relatively modest amount of overall income that is being paid to households and corporations relative to the magnitude of the expansion of the economy all this this you know la last month we did a a deep dive talking more about the fact that the fiscal story the fiscal expansion story uh is not like to be uh you know is not the primary driver of what's going on with this expansion here this this income from elevated interest rates has been a real focus if anything it's a it's an even worse story when you look at the numbers in terms of how big a deal it is um and all of this is really to say there are there are many folks who are out there in the market who are who are confused deeply confused about what's driving this expansion and that's because the expansion is very different than any that we've experienced in our professional lives but what i'd emphasize is that this expansion this income driven expansion is actually very common if you look across countries across time particularly if you start to think about um economies that that generally have less debt uh as a driver of their activity uh often shifts in income growth uh are the primary driver of shifts in economic conditions and while the us obviously doesn't have a limit in terms of the credit growth that's occurring credit growth is relatively modest compared to past cycles and so the story here is much more like an oldtime expansion where someone's income uh leads to their spending and that spending leads to someone else's income and that someone else's income leads to their spending and so on and so forth and that can that will continue to occur sustainably until the point in which predominantly uh that there is something that interrupts the desire to spend versus save and in general the thing that does that is shifts in asset prices create shifts in a desire to save more to for instance a decline in asset prices would create a desire to save more which would then create a slowdown in spending and that cycle that sustainable cycle that exists today would start to fade as a result
Inflation is Too Damn High!,2024-05-20 12:15:00+00:00,5,2x6xwoWpO4I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x6xwoWpO4I,from the fed's perspective uh no matter how you look at it inflation's too damn uh and as a simple example if you take over here on the leand side uh this uh jason ferman table which uh he puts out after every uh series of inflation data what you see is if you look at that table every single number on that table is too high for the fed no matter how you slice it inflation is too high and you can slice and dice it all the different ways and all the different uh hope that it might be close but none of those numbers are 2% on that table and if anything what it's showing is that inflation is moving in the wrong direction not the right direction across nearly all of those measures and why that's happening i think what you could see here on the right hand side is the breakdown of how much of that inflation's occurring from the cyclical contributions versus the as cyclical contributions and what it shows is that uh cyclical contributions are stabilizing in terms of their contribution around 2% which is consistent with some moderation from the extremes uh that we saw in the postco period but largely consistent with uh with a dynamic that uh you know with a relatively late cycle relatively tight economy so you're seeing that that stabilize and that's stabilizing at about a point above where it was in the pre-co period and then i think probably the mo most important dynamic here that's happening is that we've seen the end of the disinflationary impulse from the as cyclical side of the economy that acyclical side of the economy which was so critical to creating the downward disinflationary force in the in measured inflation over the course of of uh starting at the end of 22 and into 23 that is bottomed and is now starting to rise and i think it's important to recognize that um that when you look at this a cyclical contribution you know the the the peak uh negative impulse disinflationary impulse in that measure basically aligned with the fed suggesting that they were going to pivot and so what they didn't recognize at the time was that that big disinflation ar impulse was not likely to be sustained we had a high rate of inflation as supply chains seized when supply chains got resolved or have been you know on the pro in the process of being resolved that created a big disinflationary force but eventually that will slow and the question is basically what level do we reset the as cyclical uh inflation at you know through the course of the 2015 to 20199 period we saw it average from a contribution perspective at about 0.5% but if we have an environment where de globalization is happening where uh there's greater uh supply parallel supply chain chain creation uh where investment continues to be relatively elevated in order to deal with those supply shocks and where um you know the several decades of integration that we've seen are starting to uh starting to fade not to mention i should say the fact that uh there's pressures on commodity prices uh as a function of increased global conflict the odds that we see a cyclical inflation stabilize at that 0.5% that we saw in the pre-co period are pretty low i mean even just a move of acyclical inflation back to what we saw in the in the preg gfc period where it averaged about 1.5% combined with cyclical inflation at roughly 2% uh put you in a p position that that first looks a lot like what the overall inflation measures look like and second creates a lot of risk that the fed can meet its mandate uh in the near term

too easily objection number two is okay well i've heard that commercial real estate is having a really tough time i heard there was that building in san francisco that went from like a trillion dollars to 30 cents on the dollar so what about commercial real estate i mean clearly interest rates are hurt in commercial real estate right bob well uh commercial real estate uh was hurting well before we had a rise in interest rates uh and of course because you know workforce patterns have shifted um it has created a particular pain in shiny office buildings in large metropolitan centers um the the first thing i'd say about that is um uh there has been actually a fair amount of evolution uh on that dimension really even over the course of the last couple years like new york city uh is now at an 80% uh midtown occupancy rate where it was you know in the 60s and the 50s before so occupancy is coming back it's probably not going to reach uh you know anywhere near the levels that we saw in 2019 but it's not nearly as disastrous as some people had suggested so that's helpful for those those um those uh buildings uh and the yielding of them it is true that the rise in interest rates has made the financing of those buildings more expensive um and that much of that lending has come from banks uh i think the important thing to recognize though is that those the loans you have to you have to roll up your sleeves it's it's you can't just say well prices are are down a fair amount um therefore it's going to be a problem here the ro just leaves to understand the loans the loans are most of the loans are 50 ltv loans meaning there's $50 of equity and $50 of borrowing that uh goes to the banks uh most of that bank lending is on balance sheet which means that um banks only have to recognize those problems at the time in which uh the the debt comes due on average those debts run between 5 and 10 years in terms of duration uh and they can be rolled extended modified i always like to joke you know one thing bankers are really good at is figuring out how to deal with bad loans not so much lending but figuring out how to deal with the bad lending that they've done in the past and you know there's a fair amount of regulatory relief in place for those banks to extend and pretend and that is um you know that is not that is totally normal that's how the banking how banking has worked for thousands of years has been ex ex you know take in income today extended and pretend badly loans and hope for the future and eventually over long periods of time write it off and so you put those things together um it's a a problem concentrated in a very small uh segment of of the of the commercial real estate market i should also mention you know downtown shiny office buildings are only like 5 or 10% of the overall commercial real estate market there's lots of other things in commercial real estate like you know warehouses and gas stations and strip malls and you know multif family apartment buildings those all sorts of stuff in commercial real estates that not downtown shiny office buildings occupany is rising the loans are relatively uh well capitalized uh the banks are uh they they're taking a long time to in duration and the banks have a lot of flexibility to extend and pretend honestly before the losses peak in this like it's going to be it's probably going to be five years five to seven years before losses in c peak and like five to seven years i mean i don't know what you're doing in five to seven years but you know like we will have forgotten this conversation in 5 to seven years b i will never forget a conversation with you as long as i live that was an easy softball okay let's let's take the final objection which is all right yeah i hear all this stuff and you know extend and pretend but what about me as an individual investor i hear from the financial media well the treasury is a risk-free return which you can obviously disagree with that but okay at 5% or five and a half percent i can get a cd from my bank or i can buy a t- bill and chill as they say and i can just get 5% so should that mean that on the margin when someone's saying i got a million dollars i can either get a guaranteed 5% zero risk as they say or i could go into the stock market which is very risky and the stocks are all bubbles and we're in a bubble economy and all these stocks are going to tank and it's going to be like the next great depression so aren't people taking their money instead of the stock market and putting it into cds and treasury bonds and bills and so can't that hurt the stock market just because there's 5% interest rates yeah well certainly the the repricing it it's normal uh in a tightening cycle to have a repricing of uh cash rates which are risk-free essentially relative to asset uh yields and that um in many ways is uh is exactly what the central bank in any tightening cycle is trying to do change that tradeoff between holding cash and buying assets or holding cash and engaging in economic activity and so uh it's certainly true that on the margin uh that has created you know the higher rates on the short end have created a demand for um for cash relative to assets and and by almost by definition has created uh somewhat of a drag on asset prices relative to what would have happened otherwise that said uh you know it's not like what would have happened otherwise was constant uh that's evolved too and in part a big part of the story is the fact that we have a meaningful rise that meaningful rise in nominal incomes that we've that we talked about fueling this economic expansion uh has also been supportive to asset prices both in terms of the valuations of the asset prices seeing you know higher nominal earnings as a function of that but also in terms of continuing a flow of capital to those asset prices because if people are employed and they're earning good wages they're saving in their 401ks and that is supporting in asset prices that that's a very stable sticky support to asset prices and so in many ways what's happened when you look at um what's what's happened for instance in the equity market uh you over the last couple of years is that uh discount rates interest rates have risen cash rates have risen uh but stocks are still up in aggregate and that reflects the fact that those earnings have risen during that period because nominal grow grow has been pretty good and then further uh you know to some extent that is then being further extrapolated in the future now that might be a good idea or that might be a bad idea i think it's probably a little uh froy in terms of how much it's extrapolated but the basic fundamental idea of uh of equities rising in this environment over and i say over the last couple of years you know there's a lot of fundamental oriented drivers for why equities have risen in the postco period
Unlimited Monthly Macro Webinar May 2024,2024-05-16 19:30:02+00:00,56,QkvHfmrTNZw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkvHfmrTNZw,"[music] for this month's uh monthly macro webinar i think as we get started i i think it's so important to start uh with the big picture and the big picture uh that in some ways uh has not changed very much uh over the course of you know really the last two plus years uh and what that picture shows here particularly on the right hand side is that that nominal end demand has largely been stable over the course of the last uh nine quarters or so uh running between somewhere around 5 to 6% uh and you know you can cut it a bunch of different ways but the basic picture is that nominal growth in the us economy is pretty stable pretty strong at 6% um and quite sustainable now the exact measure real growth numbers they've moved around a bit over the course of the last couple of years uh in particular uh they were a bit lower during periods of more elevated price growth and they've been higher during periods of less elevated price growth but the big picture story here is no matter how you slice it you know uh nominal growth is relatively elevated and real growth particularly if we look at real growth over the course uh of the last say six or seven quarters continues to be strong enough uh to keep labor markets tight to keep the economy tight and uh to keep uh significant momentum uh economic momentum in place which uh is for from the fed's perspective great from the unemployment side of their mandate but continues to raise questions about whether uh they'll be able to sustainably bring inflation back down to 2% and so that's the starting point this durable sustainable nominal growth that's happening in the economy that continues uh to keep things tight and price pressures in place um try if you look at employment in that context you know employment has remained incredibly stable over the last 18 to 20 four months you know everyone is focused on you know this detail about the employment report or that detail about the employment report but if you take a step back and you look over the course of the last 18 months what you see is that the us labor market has been adding you know a few hundred, jobs pretty consistently uh over the course of the last 18 to 24 months if we look at the average of the last say 3 months it's right around 240,000 that's roughly on par with the average over the past 18 months uh so nothing here suggests uh a meaningful turn in employment conditions i think you know folks are often drawn to try and make news out of any individual report and it's just it's not the it's not the way to look at the picture because there's always noise in any one report in any particular time series what you want to do is you want to you want to look holistically at the overall picture in terms of labor and you don't want to get focused on the wiggle between one report and another report and so when we look at other pieces of information whether it's layoffs and discharges which at 1% uh of employment uh is running essentially as low as it ever has and that has been very stable over the course uh of the last 18 months or you look at the unemployment rate which you know if you just take a a slight step back from the wiggles basically shows stable low unemployment secular lows over the course of the last 18 months as well in this case uh sort of uh penciling out the big spike and recovery that happened uh you know during and then post covid you basically see that we have an employment picture where you know people are focusing on all the wiggles but you know largely looks consistent with uh the the sort of tightness of labor markets that we saw pre-co so you know that overall picture from an employment perspective suggests that uh labor markets remain relatively tight uh so strong nominal growth relatively tight labor markets what loosening we have seen in the labor markets has really come from a supply side not uh a problem with demand part of the way that you can see that is that layoffs and discharges involuntary separations has been basically flat through this whole period a lot of people are focused on quits uh or they're focused on openings uh and i think or are on high rings and i think one of the problems with that is those dynamics are naturally connected to each other people quit because they're going to get higher right and so you can have hirings hirings and quits are connected to each other but they're often connected uh by the fact that they are voluntary separations and rehiring in other locations one of the one of the great ways that you can see about how the labor market the underlying fundamental labor market is working is by looking at this layoffs and discharges line because it gives you a much better sense of whether something's changing from an involuntary perspective and there you don't see uh a pickup at all in involuntary uh layoffs which suggests that companies are choosing to keep the labor as much as they can and whatever uh whatever uh switching that's occurring uh from quits to hiring uh you know that spiked right after covid basically every person who wanted to switch their job basically did and now we're in a situation where you know we're in the great stay uh as some folks have described it but on the supply side the thing on the labor side what what modest loosening we have seen over the course of the last couple of uh quarters has really been driven by supply side and you know there's nothing there's nothing bad about supply side loosening of labor markets from an overall economic perspective because what it means is that overall incomes are growing which allows for continuation of nominal spending that nominal gdp that we're seeing uh we're seeing uh that loosening of labor markets from the supply side really in two places one uh in the increase in labor force participation shown on these charts the purple line showing primate working age uh labor force participation back up to multi-decade highs and then in particular seeing that labor supply coming from what is shown here on the right hand side which is a pickup in prime age uh female labor force participation uh that is now you know basic at all-time highs um and so that's indicative of strong labor markets strong labor demand people coming in in addition to the increased participation rate we're also seeing uh a surge in uh immigration which has uh which has added jobs you know which has basically increased the i should say the supply of labor into the economy and we're seeing certain areas particularly uh some of the lower education cohorts go from being extraordinarily tight to being you know slightly less tight as a function of that but again that is indicative of a positive overall economic environment where we're having uh pretty strong payrolls growth pretty strong labor force participation pretty strong supply of people coming into the labor force all of that is uh consistent with a sustainable and and pretty strong economic expansion and as a result of the fact that labor markets remain pretty tight we're seeing wage growth continue to be uh relatively elevated in comparison to where we were preco uh here on the left hand side what we show is eci which is probably the best benchmark in terms of overall labor costs uh that we can look at although when i look at this i look at a wide range of different measures on an ongoing basis and what do we see here is that the most recent eci numbers uh whether you're looking at uh at total compensation or wages and salaries or public or private the basic picture is largely the same uh where we have wage growth on this particular measure running between four and 5% which is significantly elevated to where it was in the preo period where it was running you know roughly 2 to 3% so we've got uh you know something like a point or two higher ongoing wage growth in the economy than existed preco and the real question is um from an inflation perspective is whether or not that's being met with increased productivity now part of the way that you could think about structural inflation in an economy is to simply ask the question what is the nominal wage growth per hour work that i'm paying and how is that moving relative to the productive output that i'm getting per worker per hour that difference the difference between nominal wage growth and productivity growth sets the structural inflationary pressures in an economy because it basically says how much am i paying relative to how much am i producing the difference between those two things essentially has to to be the price and so productivity is an integral component of understanding whether these structural infl or whether these inflationary pressures are uh are in place as a function of these tight labor markets and over on the right hand side what you see is the most recent productivity information i think there's a real question here in terms of the path of productivity uh we saw productivity spike during covid in particular because lower pro uh lower productivity workers were let go at the bottom of the economic cycle but since then you know productivity is largely chopped sideways and it was particularly notable to see in the most recent reporting most recent gdp reporting that we had essentially flat growth in productivity uh in the first quarter which marked a shift in trend from the increases that we had seen in a few quarters before i think you know productivity is it's a very hard thing to measure but the basic question is are we in an environment where productivity is expanding rapidly and starting to get back to sort of that trend productivity measure that we saw pre-co or are we environment where productivity is actually mostly chopping sideways in other developed economies we've basically seen productivity move sideways and so even those economies that had relatively slow growth uh weak growth like europe and the uk have been able to maintain secularly low unemployment rates because labor productivity has been uh incredibly weak the question that exists here in the us is are we going to be able in the interplay of these two charts with that 1 to 2% higher wage growth are we going to get 1 to two% higher productivity growth in the economy so as to not have those structural inflationary pressures emerge and i think what you see here is that there's real questions about whether that's going to happen uh with this with this chopping sideways recently what we have here uh as a result of the tight labor markets so strong growth tight labor markets uh elevated wage growth is that uh we have what i' i'd call an income le expansion uh that's pretty different from most of the uh expansions that we've seen uh during our professional careers during most of our lifetimes uh who are probably uh on this call right now most of the time we've seen credit driven expansions so whether it was in the 2008 period or uh the the tech boom period in both of those periods uh economic activity expanded as a result of either households or businesses taking on substantial debt and using that to finance uh their their spending or their investment and the economy and when that flow of credit slowed in part as a function of tightening monetary policy that then created a really significant slowdown in economic activity as booming credit went to slowing credit the story today is totally different credit growth in the us economy uh across the non-financial sectors uh is running basically at recessionary levels uh at you know roughly a couple percent of gdp uh on an annualized basis and what that suggests is despite the fact that we're having relatively low credit growth we're having pretty strong spending growth uh particularly from the household sector and so how can that be well the way that that works is that we're having an income le uh expansion and so here on the left hand side what you see is the total compensation of employees received this from the personal income and spending report and what it shows is that uh the overall household wage and salary income growth is running about five or 6% and then notable which is elevated relative to what it's been in the last you know 25 years give or take and then you go over to the right hand side and you look at the spending side of things and you see well spending is running at at uh 5 to six per. and so what you basically have is a very sustainable dynamic because if households are basically taking in a certain amount of wage growth and growing their spending in line with that wage growth that's something that can continue for an extended period of time because it doesn't have the sort of buildup of debt dynamics that would typically occur in a credit lead expansion you don't have that unsustainable debt boom uh that eventually starts to slow significantly as monetary policy tightens and a lot of there's been a lot of conversations about other dynamics uh that are predominantly driving uh the story i think folks who have sort of been brought up really focused on the idea of a credit driven cycle are confused about how about why the the overall gdp growth remains so strong in an environment where there's relatively tight monetary policy and relatively low credit growth and so those folks are searching for solutions searching for ways to describe or possible ideas in terms of how to describe what's going on uh in terms of what's financing the spending one of the most popular theories that has emerged over the course of the last couple of months has been that elevated interest rates are leading to elevated income uh for the holders of those assets which is then leading to elevated spending r and that theory does not simply doesn't hold up when you actually do the numbers so on the leftand side upper left hand side what you see here is the total household interest in inome earned uh through time relative to overall nominal gdp growth in the us economy those two charts are put on different levels because uh they're different meaningfully different levels but the scale sizes are the same so you can compare the magnitude of the changes between uh the two series and what you see is uh the overall household interest income that is being earned has has risen but it is a tiny tiny uh rise in comparison to overall nominal gdp and if anything this probably overstates the story since the vast majority of households that are earning interest income are higher income cohorts with lower propensity to spend that incremental earned income on the right hand side you see the same story basically from a corporation perspective where elevated rates particularly for large cashh holding uh businesses large businesses with with substantial cash holdings have uh have more than offset the increase uh in overall financing costs because they've locked in long-term debt at low interest rates but again the overall picture the amount of uh in interest income that has has uh has occurred as a function of that activity is dem minimus relative to the overall moves and gdp growth finally you look at the bottom another way to triangulate it is looking at how the government says how much are they paying to households and corporations as a function of their um activities you know as function of their ongoing interest payments and again what you see there is a relatively modest amount of overall income that is being paid to households and corporations relative to the magnitude of the expansion of the economy all this this you know la last month we did a a deep dive talking more about the fact that the fis story the fiscal expansion story uh is not likely to be uh you know is not the primary driver of what's going on with this expansion here this this income from elevated interest rates has been a real focus if anything it's a it's an even worse story when you look at the numbers in terms of how big a deal it is um and all of this is really to say there are there are many folks who are out there in the market who are who are confused deeply conf confused about what's driving this expansion and that's because this expansion is very different than any that we've experienced in our professional lives but what i'd emphasize is that this expansion this income driven expansion is actually very common if you look across countries across time particularly if you start to think about um economies that that generally have less debt uh as a driver of their activity uh often shifts in income growth uh are the primary driver of shifts in economic conditions and while the us obviously doesn't have a limit in terms of the credit growth that's occurring credit growth is relatively modest compared to past cycles and so the story here is much more like an oldtime expansion where someone's income uh leads to their spending and that spending leads to someone else's income and that someone else's income leads to their spending and so on and so forth forth and that can that will continue to occur sustainably until the point in which predominantly uh that there is something that interrupts the desire to spend versus save and in general the thing that does that is shifts in asset prices create shifts in a desire to save more to for instance a decline in asset prices would create a desire to save more which would then create a slowdown in spending and that cycle that sustainable cycle that exists today would start to fade as a result from the fed's perspective uh no matter how you look at it inflation's to dam uh and as a simple example if you take over here on the leftand side uh this uh jason ferman table which he puts out after every uh series of inflation data what you see is if you look at that table every single number on that table is too high for the fed no matter how you slice it inflation is too high and you can slice and dice it all the different ways and all the different uh hope that it might be close but none of those numbers are 2% on that table and if anything what it's showing is that inflation is moving in the wrong direction not the right direction across nearly all of those those measures and why that's happening i think what you could see here on the right hand side is the breakdown of how much of that inflation's occurring from the cyclical contributions versus the as cyclical contributions and what it shows is that uh cyclical contributions are stabilizing in terms of their contribution around 2% which is consistent with some moderation from the extremes uh that we saw in the postco period but largely consistent with uh with a dynamic that uh you know with a relatively late cycle relatively tight economy so you're seeing that stabilize and that's stabilizing at about a point above where it was in the pre-co period and then i think probably the mo most important dynamic here that's happening is that we've seen the end of the disinflationary impulse from the acyclical side of the economy that cyclical side of the economy which was so critical to creating the downward disinflationary force in the in measured inflation over the course of uh starting at the end of 22 and into 23 that is bottomed and is now starting to rise and i think it's important to recognize that um that when you look at this a cyclical contribution you know the the the peak uh negative impulse disinflationary impulse in that measure basically aligned with the fed suggesting that they were going to pivot and so what they didn't recognize at the time was that that big disinflationary impulse was not likely to be sustained we had a high rate of inflation as supply chains seized when supply chains got resolved or have been you know on the pro in the process of being resolved that created a big disinflationary force but eventually that will slow and the question is basically what level do we reset the a cyclical uh inflation you know through the course of the 2015 to 20199 period we saw an average from a contribution perspective at about 0.5% but if we have an environment where de globalization is happening where uh there's greater uh supply parallel supply chain chain creation uh where investment continues to be relatively elevated in order to deal with those supply shocks and where um you know the several decades of integration that we've seen are starting to uh starting to fade not to mention i should say the fact that uh there's pressures on commodity prices uh as a function of increased global conflict the odds that we see a cyclical inflation stabilize at that 0.5% that we saw in the pre-co period are pretty low i mean even just a move of a cyclical inflation back to what we saw in the in the free gfc period where it averaged about 1.5% combined with cyclical inflation at roughly 2% uh puts you in a p position that that first looks a lot like what the overall inflation measures look like and second creates a lot of risk that the fed can meet its mandate uh in the near term when it comes to markets what we see is that you know much of this strong growth and need for tighter monetary policy is largely priced in to a number of financial markets you know equity prices uh have reached uh you know are basically at highs uh expectations of fed cuts have gone from six to seven cuts expected to kick off the year now to roughly one to two um those two markets basically are reflecting the strength of the economy the inflationary pressures and the need uh to maintain tight money for an extended period of time the main place that's not reflecting that is in the term structure of interest rates which if you were to you know there's a lot of different ways to measure the term structure of interest rates and the term premium uh and you know you put a bunch of academics in the room and they'll all have their own opinion about it um it it doesn't matter so much exactly how you measure it and what the precise number is what matters more is to kind of get a sense as to what does that ter term premium that rough term premium look like relative to what it's been say for the last 10 years and how does that compare to how economic conditions look relative to the same period so as a simple example if you take a look at this measure of term premium what you see is that uh you know the current term premium in the bond market 10-year bond market is roughly consistent with uh the average that it's been over the course of the last 10 years 10 or 15 years and that's pretty notable considering the fact that that uh if you look at uh the the economic conditions right now uh they're certainly more considerably more elevated relative to how they've been on average over the last 10 years if you look at inflation pressures they're certainly more elevated relative to what they've been in the last 10 years and if you look at uh overall tightness of financial conditions uh you know uh the short rate has been very elevated uh relative to what it's been the last 10 years and so you sort of put all these different pictures together the need for tighter monetary policy for an extended period of time is certainly unusual relative to the last 10 years and so uh stronger growth higher inflation and need for tighter structural monetary policy you put all those things together and the idea that you have essentially the same term premium in place that you did uh over the last 10 years it doesn't quite add up uh in terms of how the long end is priced that's occurring at a time when we're likely to see the long long end supply continue the last time we talked there was real questions about exactly what policy would be announced in the qra um and the reality is uh what we got was just basically more of the same and if you look here on the leth hand side what you see is a chart of the total amount of notes and bonds that are being issued over the course of the next uh six months or so and what you see here is that uh that level of issuance is going to continue to be uh significantly elevated not quite uh not quite higher than in in history but um but nonetheless it's going to remain considerably elevated and as a function of that you'll have continued pressure on the bond market uh as that supply continues to flow through that supply if anything is worse than what it's been in a fair amount of the uh postco period because at least back when we had that big supply around covid you had a situation where there was significant bond buying by the by the federal reserve whereas at this point you know quantitative uh tightening continues to create a drag on the bond an ongoing flow and drag on the bond market and when you think about that basic story what ends up happening is that will in one way shape or form that's essentially the selling of bonds is essentially an ongoing negative flow of capital in or negative ative flow in terms of asset prices as it represents a continued flow or sale of asset prices on an ongoing basis and so the thing i think is pretty interesting is how asset prices are currently transpiring relative to where we've been uh over the course of the last couple of years and what you see there is uh with that measure of rar basically asset prices have remained constant uh you know still near highs uh relative to the last couple years they fell as the bond supply question uh came into existence sort of late last uh fall but by and large asset prices have recovered uh what happened last fall and they remain basically at peaks now that's particularly notable because what it means is that um such strong asset prices combined with this significant flow of supply really raises a question about whether we're going to continue to see such strong asset prices is ahead the bond supply is going to affect all asset prices in one way shape or form continuing on i think what that really highlights to me is that um you know the the thing that's going on the thing that's going on in ter in terms of the cross asset markets is that the bond market really is in control um the bond market uh you know i think there was a period of time when we we were coming into the year where uh expectations of us economic outcomes were quite different uh than um than what was likely to transpire so coming into the year what we saw was that you know expectations of us growth in 2024 were going to be about 1% or lower but then what happened what shifted uh to kick off the year was a big shift in those expectations uh for particularly in the us stock market where today us stocks are now expected to uh have you know earnings growth at something like 177% by the end of the year on a year-over-year basis and economist estimates of economic growth in the us are for us uh economic real gdp to be about two and a half% over the course of the entirety of 2024 2 and a half% gdp in this economy is you know pretty strong gdp all things considered and so what you see here is a picture that that sort of got priced in that repricing of the strength of economic conditions got priced in we saw stocks basically move to new highs we saw bond yields move up uh somewhat in response to that but now we've transitioned to a different point in the cycle where what's happening instead is that expectations of strong growth already exist uh in the market and continue to remain in place so what creates the incremental shift in terms of asset prices is not those expectations because they're still firmly in place place what creates the shift in expect in in prices is now the discount rate and we see this everywhere across uh cross assets so we see in the us stock market basically trading highly correlated to the us bond market in the last couple of weeks we see you know foreign bond markets trading uh tightly uh to what's going on in the us bond market we see you know the yen trading close closely connected to what's going on in the us bond market and we also see you know assets as extreme as what's going on with bitcoin trading closely to what's going on in the us bond market and so all of those things are indications and you know that that uh bond market connection created a selloff in asset prices in april and then created a rally here uh to kick off the the month of may as bond yields started to to come down and so uh you know i think a lot of folks are focused on what's going on with say earnings or or other dynamics in the market but what's really driving the moves in asset prices are uh are what's happening with the long end so the long end is really in control and in control globally and then as i mentioned we've had a pretty big shift in terms of what's going on with pricing of us stocks uh and growth expectations in the us economy you know when we came into the year uh expectations were for very very weak growth all things considered particularly considering the fact that we saw such a big move down in bond yields and such a significant rise in the equity market you know we talked to kick off the year in terms of the um in terms of the overall economic set of conditions we talked at great length about the sort of stronger for longer idea uh to be firmly in place and that that wasn't reflected in asset markets uh but at this point as i said that that is largely reflected in asset markets and instead expectations have now risen particularly when it comes to equities to levels that are relatively extreme scen you know earnings growth shown on the right hand side has basically been flat uh in one form or another for the last you know couple of years and nonetheless what's expected is for relatively extreme earnings growth uh to occur uh over the course of 2024 that number there by q424 is for something like 17% year-over-year earnings growth i mean 17% year-over-year earnings growth for an economy that's growing you know well at a nominal growth rate of something like 6% would require a significant expansion in margins to levels that are well above uh you know to levels that are basically back to secular highs and it's notable in in particular for that earnings growth that uh it's not primarily coming from the mag s expectations are for non-m s uh companies to contribute the vast majority of that earnings growth so it's not like the ai or tech revolution is going to be the thing that's going to going to drive that earnings growth or is not the thing that's expected to drive that earnings growth higher we have to get the whole economy in place to give you that 177% earnings growth through the course of the year switching over to the rest of the world and then we'll uh we'll get to some questions here in just a second what we see in the rest of the world uh you know starting with japan is that the japanese unilateral interventions which have gotten a lot of uh got a lot of ink and and occurred over the course of the last couple of weeks uh are unlikely to make a meaningful structural difference in the yen uh unless we see a significant uh change in the stance of us monetary policy or in shifts in the us bond yields and so what we've seen is that the yen uh negative pressures on the yen have persisted uh as us interest rates have risen over the course of the last uh couple of months uh and what intervention that the boj the mlf has have done has done has largely faded pretty quickly you know i sort of joked uh a couple a couple days the first intervention that they did the half-life uh of a yen intervention was something like three or four business days and then the halflife of their intervention most recently was about you know 12 hours uh and that really speaks to the fact that the underlying pressures uh inflationary pressures that or underlying uh negative pressures on the yend that exist through different you know much much weaker conditions in easier monetary policy largely remain in place conditions in europe and the uk uh have actually been improving uh and you can see it here in the pmis which are much better measures in europe and the uk than they are in the us and what you see there is that uh basically expectations for european and uk growth in 2024 are very very depressed certainly relative to what we see uh in the us context uh and nonetheless we're seeing an improvement in economic conditions in those economies so it's very possible that we see those economies surpris to the upside relative to the us here in 2024 uh the last thing i' i'd end with which uh you know i feel like i i'd have to be remiss not to talk at least a little about is what's going on in the gold market i i think there's sort of a strategic question in terms of what's going on with gold which i highlight here on the leftand side which is if you just look at gold's performance over the last five years and i love the last five years in general because we basically had every single macroecon major macroeconomic environment uh that you could imagine in the last five years and so i think it's a really good stress test really good case study in terms of how to think about how assets perform and how to build a great portfolio and what you see is gold has been a great diversifying tool over the course of that entire time frame and has continued to show its role of the fact that uh that gold you know outperforms bonds in roughly 50% of draw downs in the equity market and that's continued uh during this period as well uh then there's a more tactical story on gold which continues to be very interesting in particular the strength of gold demand that we've seen has really not come out of the west uh with gold etf flows continuing to press to new lows continuing to be very weak despite the fact that there's significant price rises that's unusual usually you see retail demand for uh etfs uh rising in instances where the price is rising but instead in this cycle what we've seen is we've seen uh these we've seen the retail demand for for gold etfs to actually be negative what that highlights is that the vast majority of the rally in gold that we've seen has been a function of demand in the east demand from china in particular uh domestic the domestic private sector which has struggled to find ways to move uh assets out of china in response to the the challenging currency dynamics that exists there and so what we're seeing is that they're buying gold and you can see all sorts of different wake of that whether it's the elevated shanghai premium or whe whether it's the premium on domestic gold etfs what is occurring there is basically a loss in faith of the chinese currency uh as well as domestic chinese assets assets and so that demand uh is the primary driver even a slowing of western demand from aggregate selling on an ongoing basis to roughly flat could easily create a dynamic where gold sees upside uh an upside surprise so i'll pause there uh we'll go to a few audience questions here i'll i'll just pause it very briefly um as i pull up some of these uh great audience questions that we got ahead of time and then again if you have any questions and you want to uh put them into the into the chat feel free to go ahead and do that um let's start with uh question number one how do changes in gas prices affect your order of the macro linkages at all and do they um you know how do you weigh the difference between uh the pressure from higher inflation and the pressure directly on demand i think it's a good it's a very interesting question the the short of which is that um in terms of the questions is that uh is that we have a circumstance where uh oil basically goes into every asset price and if anything uh the shift in oil prices the shift in gas prices has been one of the more important uh acyclical uh drivers of the inflationary pressures that we've seen that have emerged recently um you know gas pric is a big part of how the disinflationary impulse flowed through to the economy last year year was the gas prices went from four bucks to three bucks a gallon but more recently have started to rise back to $4 a gallon and that's a pretty important story because what it means is that uh you know for many uh for many folks who you know for for the price pressures that exist in the economy that's basically creating an inflation you know that went from a disinflationary impulse to inflationary impulse and it takes a fair amount of time to flow through so while say oil prices have been a little soft in recent weeks we still have a lot of gasoline price based inflationary pressures that are likely to flow through and that's going to take some time to flow through to all other uh prices in the economy and so from the fed's perspective they're already concerned about where inflation is today and we have this added pressure of a bit of additional inflation uh inflationary impulse coming from gas prices and that's going to more than outweight the incremental impact from uh from lower essentially lower post gas uh incomes and spending that comes as a result just hitting another question that was submitted ahead of time uh what does nipa profit data say about economic momentum i i i think one of the things um that's pretty interesting about looking at overall profits in the economy overall profit margins in the economy relative to say profit margins that we're seeing with the s&p 500 is that we're really seeing uh the largest companies continue to be able to hold relatively elevated profit margins whereas we're seeing uh deterioration particularly in that sort of middle part of the economy those smaller businesses uh that are struggling uh that are typically borrowing more on the short end that are typically uh that may need uh cash on an ongoing basis to sustain uh their growth or expansion that's really where we're seeing uh margins start to compress and so there's quite a big gap between you know uh small caps and midcaps relative to those mega caps uh and that's persisting uh through time uh and then finally uh a question in terms of the the submitted ahead of time uh how are global inflationary pressures uh how are uh global inflation pressures that are pretty different across uh countries uh influencing uh may influence fed policy i think that's a great question one of the things that's been really interesting to see is that you know i think a lot of folks uh sort of say the old the age-old the the adage that you know the fed controls what other policy makers are doing and i think increasingly what we're seeing as those other policy makers shift towards an easing cycle is that uh those policy makers are actually getting out ahead of the fed and easing in response to uh the economic conditions that they for their own economies part of this is to be expected as many of those economies have meaningfully higher short-end rate sensitivity uh because of the structure of their debt markets and particularly the structure of their household borrowing markets that's that's a pretty interesting story and what it means is that those economies have slowed more are experiencing uh a greater slowing of inflationary pressures and are shifting to easing at a time when the fed is continuing to need to maintain typ policy given the strength of the us economy has a couple of key market implications one it should be beneficial for the dollar as monetary policy pressures between the two economies you know between the us and other developed economies diverge i think it's also interesting when looking in the long end of the bond market because in part what's happened is that us rates remain pretty elevated relative to the rest of the developed world pretty much the last time that we saw such elevation of us rates relative to the rest of the developed world was back in the 80s period and that has important implications in terms of keeping a significant demand in place from the foreign private sector uh which is basically uh funding a substantial portion of the us the ongoing us deficit uh as rates start to fall in the rest of the world that essentially makes us bonds even more attractive and creates uh incremental flow uh in terms of buying of us treasury bonds uh you know and and helping keep prices below what they would have been otherwise i i think it it in many ways it it um it reminds me of what happened uh in the us bond market in the 2005ish period where we had a big uh flow of global central banks buying of bonds and that created a long end that remained relatively depressed in comparison to economic the boom in econ iomic conditions and helped finance the housing bubble now i don't think we're in a bubble right now but i do think we have significant bond supply and we have elevated inflation uh and an economy that's running too hot that would benefit from higher long-end bondi uh but if what's happening is the rest of the world is easing and that's flowing back into the us economy essentially what that means is the long end is not able to do the work that the fed uh needs in order to slow the economy and moderate inflationary pressures which puts even more pressure back on the fed to do more in response and they've basically responded and said that because of their concerns about how tight monetary policy is already that they don't necessarily want to engage in further monetary tightening it all connects to the possibility of the fact that uh monetary policy may be insufficiently tight given economic conditions for an extended period of time and this is one of the key avenues that it could could come in and so uh you know that dynamic favors steepening of the yield curve to some extent and it also favors hard assets relative to fiat dollars if us policy is likely to remain too easy for too long let's go to the uh the live q&a here um i'll just pull that up uh here so we can go through a few of those questions as well uh give it a few more minutes here i know i've run over the top of the hour so thank you for uh for sticking around [music] um yeah i i i think there's a there's a couple questions here [music] um uh related to the labor market and the overall labor market dynamics i think one of the key uh questions here is basically you know what causes the labor market to meaningfully deteriorate and uh and i think you know the ordering of that is really uh quite important i mean basically labor markets respond to demand and so what is going to create a shift a meaningful shift in the labor market not not this sort of uh small scale supply side loosening that we've seen but a meaningful shift in the labor market is going to be uh a significant amount of um of slowing in demand and so the question is basically how is that slowing of demand going to happen in an environment where credit growth is not the primary financer of demand financing of demand um and the way that that's going to happen is we probably need uh asset prices to weaken to some extent uh and a weakening of asset prices would then create the impetus for households to slow their spending relative to their wages and that slowing of spending rel to wages would then create a slowing of demand and that slowing of demand would be met to some extent by by companies with weaker employment conditions and so i i think that's the basic path is we need a weakening in order to slow the income le uh expansion we really need a significant slowing of demand and the way that demand is going to slow is either there's going to be an exogenous shock that none of us are seeing or it's going to have to be meaningful asset price deterioration i mean just think about it today uh relative to last summer we were in a position last summer where stocks were at 41 you know the s&p 500 was at 4,100 and bond yields were at 5% and yet the us economy continued to expand and so where are we today well we're well north of that 25% higher and bond yields are 50 basis points lower the idea that the economy is going to topple in this sort of environment when things are actually quite a bit better than where we were you know uh about nine months ago it just doesn't it doesn't line up with either the data that we're seeing or the cause effect linkages that you'd expect so either have to have higher rates lower asset prices and those have to either be higher and lower or longer at the elevated yield level and the lower asset price level in order to really create a significant shift in the economy um uh i think there's a good question here about shelter uh this will probably do one or two more questions but i think there's an interesting question about shelter here more generally um which is that you know a big expectation of why inflation pressures would fade in the us economy was based upon the expectations of uh falling shelter prices and what we've seen so far is that the shelter disinflation uh that has existed uh in the cycle so far has been you know pretty modest in comparison to expectations that may have been built on uh looking at uh marginal new rents or equivalent uh measures i think it's important to recognize that the vast majority of rents and the pricing of oar off of that is it does not occur from new tenant rentals it comes from existing tenant rentals and so if you look at the the fed's um you know exploratory series uh that is the all tenant uh rental rate uh growth rate what you see is that's actually ticking up if you look at other measures of all tenant rents you see that those are stabilizing at levels that are closer to three or 4% not 0% like what's being told in you know what's being shown in the new uh the new tenant rental rates and part of that is the fact that um you know new tenant rents went up a lot more uh and so they're rising at a slower pace today uh and a lot of the rental inflation that sort of existed in the new tenant rents back in the post uh postco period are finally starting to catch up across all rental rates uh smart people who think about the this specific area a fair amount uh many of them are discussing how you know the stabilization in rents might show oar and rent rental inflation uh stabilizing it sort of 3 to 4% on an annual basis and that's a real problem for the fed if it actually stabilizes at that rate and not at something like zero it's going to be pretty tough for the fed to meet its inflation mandate uh given how important shelter costs are uh to the overall picture of inflation uh we'll go through a couple more uh uh more things here i i'll probably i'll probably leave off with uh wrap up with this um with this last question which i think often um you know i think the basic question uh here from uh here uh on the live questions is look maybe the fed just will accept higher than target inflation for an extended period of time um you know my my basic picture of that is that um uh that the fed probably uh right now the fed that's currently in place probably does not want to accept uh higher than target inflation for an extended period of time and the challenges that they're facing by not tightening enough are more function of their inaccurate sense of what's driving this expansion and the uh and the potential risks from elevated monetary policy uh rather than uh a desire to forgo that 2% inflation rate um and say move it up to something like 3% um but that may not be true uh it may be possible that they are willing to accept that inflation rate and it's certainly possible that incoming administrations could be uh more open to running inflation at a more elevated rate for an extended period of time uh than the current uh fed composition and as a function of that what i'd highlight is that it's important to at least have some of your portfolio positioned in a way that at least reflects that possible reality i think in a lot of ways higher uh inflation than expected higher than target inflation for an extended period of time is quite poorly priced uh in terms of the asset in terms of the market i i think it what it highlights is um and when you're thinking about any of these sorts of trades or markets uh you have to think there's always a multiple different possibilities in terms of how things may play out and i think this one in particular is so critical because it could have such implications across asset portfolios and and long-term savings portfolios that it's time to start preparing at least for that possibility rather than being solely overweight essentially low and stable inflation and strong growth forever so with that uh we've got an hour in thank you so much for all the folks who stuck around uh for these questions uh and answering the questions as well as the presentation i really appreciate everyone joining us uh look forward to getting together uh next month"
Hard Money vs Fiat Currency?,2024-05-16 12:15:02+00:00,6,X7DdKXj-Lt0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7DdKXj-Lt0,so first do you agree with that assessment that since 1971 we've obviously had this exploding debt and that's for the worse and that these interest rates have become much more unstable than they were maybe in the previously and does that matter to investors or is this just kind of oh yeah well we used to be on gold and now we're on paper and you know things change and oh b you you weird gold bug you just like things the way they used to be so does does that matter at all the way the economies changed since 1971 or is that just kind of a fun historical tidbit oh yeah we used to be on a gold standard anyways uh back to work yeah i i think if um if you look through the history of monetary regimes um there has uh and and not just in the us context but you know if you look at for instance the history of chinese monetary regimes over you know uh hundreds of years or um or monetary regimes that uh had existed in in europe etc what you see is you often see uh fluctuations from moving from hard money regimes uh like gold standards or or um you know spey backed uh money in one way shape or form uh that eventually in one form or another uh is devalued um whether it be through like cutting coins or you know reducing the weight of the of the hard money in the coins or various other measures the introduction of um you know uh uh alternative lower quality monies um that essentially devalues the previous money uh and then eventually you get to sort of the fiat world um and the fiat world uh feels good feels better more effective uh because what it allows you to do uh from a central authorities perspective is that um you have the ability essentially to control uh to have more control over the money supply in the economy and presuma as a function of that more control over you know stimulating or uh or tightening conditions the big challenge with that is that there's always a incentive to uh for the private sector to borrow more in that currency and for the public authorities to um to continue to stimulate until the point in which you get uh that stimulation that is uh that creates uh sufficient instability and concern about the money which then uh you know sort of practically feeling is like inflation's too high in in economies and then that creates a reactionary force whether to either instill limitations of that fiat management or to move back to hard money like that's a very typical cycle um that we've seen play out over and over again and and the us context is not that much different um i think you know in s several ways uh the us fiat system um was you know uh was on the precipice of not working given the elevated inflation in the 70s and it took frankly quite a uh stern central authority to enforce that uh that the uh you know that the dollar would preserve its value relative to stuff and that was you know you go back and study that period uh it now looks from our perspective like that was how it was going to play out all along uh that vulker was going to get it done and you know we were going to have tight money and and the dollar would survive i would say if you look back through time it was certainly a little it was less certain even vulker would say it was less certain at the time than i think people gave it credit for but that ushered in for a variety of different reasons global reasons uh you know global uh disinflationary impulses and and and global integration a big disinflationary wave that has largely ended um and you know as part of that disinflationary wave interest rates came down people could borrow more their debt service would look consistent even though they were borrowing more the challenge that we have now is we're coming back to one of those instances whether whether you look at a combination of fiscal uh uh behavior uh here in the us and and and i i i can use the us as an example but it's kind of true across most of the developed world you know fiscal behavior that uh where we're running deficits that are you know wartime like def deficits at a time when unemployment is at 75 year lows um or on the monetary policy side where uh you know uh to to to put it bluntly like the the fed has uh has not met its mandate on the inflation side for several years and projects to not meet it for several more years you know i don't know about you if i had failed at doing my job for five years i should hope that someone would throw me out rather than let me just carry on with the existing approach um and i think that is the those are the types of dynamics that sew the seeds for the reversal of interest and understanding of fiat currency relative to specii uh in one form or another and i think you know we're starting to see the nent pressures related to that the real question is you know on the fiscal side and the monetary side uh you know is the us and other developed world countries are they going to uh you know tighten the belt the way that is necessary in order to preserve the value of that relative to stuff in particular or are we going to let are they going to let the desire the the the good feeling of immediate the immediate gratification of additional stimulus continue to persist which undermines the the dollar and other you know developed fiat currencies in terms of their long-term success
Debt-Driven vs Income-Driven Economic Expansion,2024-05-15 12:15:01+00:00,8,7zAfc8buGus,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zAfc8buGus,you know over the last four months we've gone from the market pricing in up to seven rate cuts for 2024 to a point where you know now there's some discussion about possible hiking so if we just take a step back where do you think the economy is at today in this current cycle you know relative to how these cycles have traditionally played out in the past yeah i think a lot of ways what we're experiencing is a um a very uh normal cycle which is unusual for most people uh in their professional lives you know most of the cycles that we've experienced um in our professional careers um have been uh boom bust type cycles whether it was you know the 2000's tech bubble and bust or whether it was the housing bubble and bust or whether it was you know co which wasn't really a bubble but it was a a exogenous shock bust and in all those circumstances basically what happened was uh economic expansion was arrested by an unsustainable dynamic whether it was an unsustainable bubble in asset prices unsustainable debt growth in 2008 or you know a a health crisis that made working unsustainable um and and so in all those circumstances i think um there there there was this sense particularly in 2000 and 2008 this sense of in habitability of a downturn occurring because there's no way that the excesses that were being built up during those periods could persist in 2000 actually there's aot you know there's the the asset price bubble but there was also a huge debt boom related to infrastructure investment company infrastructure investment related to the technology uh universe as well a lot of lot of debt driven fixed investment and the thing that's happening today is totally different what we're having today is much more of an oldtime uh economic expansion where income growth is the primary financer of economic activity meaning people's wages are growing at a reasonable pace five or six perent a year they're spending at five or six per a year that's then translating to somebody else's income which is five or six perent a year and they're spending five or six perent a year and so we're getting this sort of virtuous cycle of spending in the economy that is actually quite sustainable in the same way economic expansions back in the 50s and 60s were typically quite sustainable because they were not debt driven in a debt driven economic expansion eventually you got to pay back the debt so there's only so much debt you can take in an income driven expansion that can con continue for an extended period of time and so what we're having instead is basically an oldtime cycle from the 50s or 60s where the strength in those conditions is then creating uh an economic exp expansion uh the economy is too hot relative to the underlying you know productivity in the economy which means that we're having inflationary pressures and the central bank you know the fed is just responding to those inflationary pressures in the way a central bank typically would in a late cycle environment by tightening monetary policy and the trouble is we haven't necessarily tightened monetary policy enough to bring to to break the inflationary pressures that are in the economy that's basically what we're seeing right now is we sort of we moved from a point you know three or four months ago where at least the market perception was that we had done enough and the fed's own commentary that we had done enough to break the cycle of inflation and now recognizing again that maybe that's not really right and that more tightening needs to be done in order to bring inflation sustainably back down to the 2% target and so that's kind of where we are right now which is very late cycle uh and at this point where inflation is still too high and we need more tightening for the fed to achieve its aims and so if we kind of take that in and look forward what do you think still needs to occur then for inflation to return sustainably to that 2% target what kind of you know components of the economy do you have your eye on right well the easy stuff is is basically the easy way to bring down inflation has already been done that's kind of the challenge you know we've resolved a lot of supply chain issues that's brought inflation down and we've also uh benefited from a significant amount of labor supply both from an increas in domestic labor participation and also from a significant influx of uh immigration and the problem is we've sort of reached the the limits of both of those levers now that labor force participation is at multi-decade highs and um you know whether or not you agree with the politics of it certainly uh moves are being made to limit uh the amount of immigration that's occurring in the economy and so you put that together with that set of changes we've only been able to bring inflation down to three or 4% not to 2% the fed's target is 2% and and uh responsibly below 2% and so what that means is in order to further bring inflation down we've got to start to create uh we either have to give up on the inflation target um or or create demand side slowing through either tighter monetary policy from the fed or from a from a b essentially a market-based titan and given the you know the fed is basically said we're going to keep rates where they are and have not really signaled hiking i mean they sort of said basically like it's possible we could hike because anything's possible um you know really what it comes down to is whether the markets the financial markets are going to do enough to create a sufficient tightening of the economy from a market-based standpoint to create a sufficient slowing to then uh start to uh slow the economy and ease inflationary pressures and that's really where we stand now with you know stocks really pricing in a strong economy short rates now reflecting you know the fact that the economy is relatively strong and inflation pressures remain persistent but really what hasn't priced it in is the is the term premium or the long bond which is still relatively low in comparison to both the short end as well as uh the typical term premium that exist in interest rates given the strength of the economy and so that's really what we're probably likely to most likely to see which is an interest rate rise we've seen some of that in recent period but we really need that interest rate rise in order to slow the economy in order to break the inflationary pressures or what's going to happen is the fed is going to have to do more work
Do High Government Deficits Matter?,2024-05-14 12:15:00+00:00,5,-RihrCnm-Vc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RihrCnm-Vc,right um and so now kind of pivoting over to the more fiscal side of things how do you think about you know the risk of the persistently high government deficits that we've seen recently you know especially considering that neither of the two presidential candidates on the ballot are likely to you know curtail spending upon taking office yeah i i think uh you could think about uh that in sort of two different uh uh elements of it which is one if you think about it from a macroeconomic perspective or a growth perspective um persistent elevated deficits are not necessarily that beneficial to growth now this is a uh probably a a perspective that you're not going to hear uh that's in congruous with the consensus where people talk about the direct deficit being the primary driver of us growth i don't believe that that's true and have written extens ly about why that is but to help build the sort of core intuition uh if you think about deficits simply as uh as let's just say you you you oversimplify what the government does you just say what the government does is it takes in taxes and it engages in transfer payments well if transfer payments in period one are $100 and transfer payments you say they takeen no taxes and they borrow and do a transfer payment of $100 if in period one um they do a $100 transfer payment uh what that does is it supports someone's income by $100 and their spending by $100 if and their def and the government's deficit is $100 if in period two the government does the same exact thing $100 of transfer payments 0 of taxes transfers it over someone's income in period two is $100 supplemented their spending is $100 supplemented the gdp growth impact of that is zero gdp growth impact is zero if deficits are constant and so instead in order to get economic expansion growth from deficits deficits actually have to rise in size in order to increase growth and that's not what we're seeing right now we're seeing large deficits but actually the deficit today is down from where it was a few years ago immediately after covid and so what that highlights is from an economic perspective deficits are not driving the expansion of economic conditions deficits are supporting the level of spending but they are not driving the growth rate in spending as a simple example in the last three years us gdp on an annualized basis is up7 trillion and deficits have contracted by about a trillion dollar annualized rate what's filling that gap is income income is driving growth that's what's going on with the deficits from a macroeconomic standpoint it's not the deficits driving growth in the last couple years it's income driving growth from a bond supply demand perspective from a markets perspective the level of deficits is actually quite relevant to what's going on with the bond price when you think about what's going on with the bond price any market is just supply and demand going on in the us government bond market there's one supplier it is the government issuing the bonds right that's essentially sales bond sales and then the question is who's demanding the bonds the persistent large level of deficit means that we have a big supply of duration coming into the market which has to be bought every day every day there's a bond auction and those bond auctions are larger than they've basically ever been except during the very height of covid and so i think that's very interesting because essentially what it's doing it's creating a persistent downward pressure on bond prices upward pressure on yields because they have to find an incremental buyer an incremental buyer and incremental buyer to buy all of that duration supply and you know right here in the second quarter we have about twice as much net duration supply uh as existed in previous quarters because those deficits are so large and so what it's creating is it's creating the level of the deficit is creating a weight on bond prices or an upward pressure on yields and then that upward pressure on yields is then flowing through to what the discount rate is on all assets and that discount rate on all assets is flowing through to asset prices and those asset prices are what ultimately influence whether or not people you know continue to spend at the same spend and save at the same pace that they have been or start to pull back and start to create that economic slowing
Institutional Investors and Hedge Funds,2024-05-13 12:15:01+00:00,5,A8QQKNxJ5-g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8QQKNxJ5-g,yeah i mean i think for um the world of institutional investing if you just look at it um you know most institutional investors these days put about half of their capital into alternatives and there's a lot of good reasons why they do that combination of uh you know higher risk adjusted returns greater diversification um and really access to outcomes that wouldn't otherwise be available um you know to just purely in the public markets and so i think when you think about that space the real advantage that uh hedge funds bring is the ability to tactically move you know long and short between assets that's something that a lot of different strategies you know whether you're passively invested in stocks or bonds or you know more structural long alternative assets like private equity and venture capital you don't have that opportunity to navigate and swit your positioning depending on the market now in general being long assets and and and being invested is is the right strategy to do in general over time so it's not to say you want to you know put all your money into a long and short strategy but there are certain times when those strategies can be complimentary to an overall portfolio being long assets and that's really what what headed funds bring to the table is that ability to bring using long and short positions in liquid markets to be able to bring that um that agility to your portfolio um that you otherwise wouldn't be able to do and and frankly part of the reason why uh it's you know they're so successful is they're able to hire some of the you know the smartest minds in the world to be able to generate that alpha to generate those strategies and um you know are essentially hired to do that by institutional investors and the outcome is as you say which is that institutional investors in part because of their allocations to things like hedge funds uh you know typically experience meaningfully better risk adjusted returns than than the everyday investor yeah talk a little bit about just how hedge funds work we've we've talked about this in previous episodes but it hasn't been the primary focus for us just uh because it does kind of seem you know set aside for for the big investors and not as accessible to more everyday uh retail you know credited type investors but talk about the idea of long and short right because if if you're investing in real estate you're buying an asset you are inherently in a long position meaning you're bullish on the future value of that being higher than it is now for whatever reason but in hedge funds you're generally trading in public markets liquid markets um and you can create hedges with different positions long versus short um betting on you know different things going on talk about where that kind of fits in a portfolio from your perspective um uh and explain what that means a little bit more yeah i mean most hedge fund strategies in in uh are are typically uh taking you know are trading some of the largest liquid markets in the world so you know things that you see covered regularly on cnbc stocks bonds currencies commodities um you know fixed income credit etc so you know maybe a 100 or 200 of the world's largest liquid markets and one of the nice things about uh typical hedge fund structures is that they have the flexibility to go long and short so you know they're in general as an example you want to be long stocks because stocks there's good reason to believe that stocks will go up over time say relative to holding your money in the bank in cash but there are certain macroeconomic circumstances where uh stocks go down uh and i think one of the challenges for many long only investors and and really the challenges for any passive investor is that if you're just simply staying long uh through time you can experience meaningful draw downs for instance in stocks you can experience 60 70% draw downs in your equity market portfolio and so what hedge funds are really focused on doing in general is trying to identify those circumstances where you know one or or many of the those major asset classes uh have pressures on them to either go you know up or down more substantially than what's expected in the market and then build a portfolio of trades which are really just bets on those markets and so one of the benefits of being in a hedge fund structure is that flexibility going long going short not being locked into a particular view and being able to respond to what is likely to occur in the macroeconomy
A Macro View on Gold and Other Hard Assets,2024-05-10 12:15:00+00:00,9,EYUvKlTITCQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYUvKlTITCQ,i mean do do you think that gold is moving as you know historically it's moved inversely correlated to real rates do you think that's what's been driving gold here do you think that people are starting to get worried about the supply story around bonds do you think this is actually it's a you know it's i wouldn't call golden illiquid asset class but it's definitely not as liquid and large as um like the us treasury market for instance do you think this is just some incremental buying that's driving the price up like what what do you think is is moving gold here and are you a fan of the asset i actually not 100% sure your opinion on gold like do you like it as an asset ah well then you haven't been listening to enough uh bobil at uh commentary no i love gold as an um and as a portfolio asset and the reason why that is is it's a it's a diversifying uh exposure and so um i think a a lot of folks um you know don't don't realize like gold outperforms bonds about half the time in equity draw downs so it's a better a better diversified higher than bonds uh you know in in 50% of of uh of weak equity markets and you know everyone holds bonds and essentially no one holds gold so which just doesn't make any sense from an empirical perspective uh in the last five years have been a pretty good test in terms of showing how gold has provided a diversifying uh position relative to bonds uh in terms of an overall portfolio so you want an allocation of 10% of a strategic portfolio to gold makes a ton of sense um you know that doesn't necessarily mean you know at times it's tactically a good buy at times it's tactically a bad buy what i'm talking about there is i'm just saying strategically you know you hold bonds in your portfolio hold some gold that's blain and simple um i think in terms of gold as a from a more tactical perspective i don't i don't really think what we're seeing is a is much of a reflection of um people's views on us mon monary and fiscal conditions driving the gold price up almost all the demand that we've seen in the gold market in the last uh couple of months has been concentrated in the chinese gold markets uh seeing the shanghai premium trade uh relatively significantly e uh domestic based gold etfs trading at 30% premiums over the spot price activity in the shanghai futures market being like forex what it was uh you know last year so most of it is related to chinese residents trying to figure out ways to get money out of yuan and into other assets when things like bitcoin um are is not available because it's illegal um or not as available because it's illegal or you know capital controls are in place to move money offshore to find dollars and so i think that that's more of the story it's more of a chinese concentrated story um you know western investors keep selling gold uh despite it going up which is kind of a wild thing it's like the only asset in the world that people keep selling when the price keeps going up h it's interesting i you know one thing that i've uh encountered less so with gold but more so with with bitcoin which is you know depending on your view sort of a similar at least narrative around it is you one one of the challenges that that i've always bumped into around bitcoin is doesn't have a yield and i i know that this is a thing for gold proponents as well that they've run into it's this is why paul tor jones calls it the the barbarous relic right it's because it doesn't have a cash flow and people can't back it into dcf or they can't model out what the returns are going to be and that's just that's yeah that's not an attitude that that i have uh you know personally i i know that's not your uh perspective as well but maybe maybe there's i've always sort of ascribed the yield story as being you know pretty challenging for for gold because no matter how you you know you can you can backdate it you can show that it's a diversifier in portfolios you can show its relative performance but many people just you know revert to this line of well there isn't any cash flows so there's no intrinsic value that's a ful mental model that a lot of people have yeah i think i think it is and i think what it is um is it's a model built on uh experience with uh you know based primarily on dollars where you know uh fiat uh yielding fiat looks better than uh non-yielding hard money in an environment where you know for we've had 40 years of secular disinflation um but i think if you just expand your perspective a little bit more what you'd find is that you know uh there are many many instances where fiat money let's say fiat bonds or fiat cash meaningfully underperforms bonds right um uh or meaningful i should say meaningfully underperforms gold um over time uh and you know if you look at the last you know let's say 150 years of fiat currencies in the veled world like holding gold would have uh been a better trade than holding those currencies in something like 60 or 70% of instances um and again like what i'm i'm not saying you know put all your money in gold because that's the best asset to hold that's not what i'm saying what i'm saying is like everyone seems convinced you want to hold bonds but the empirical evidence narrowly last five years broadly la you know during the fiat during the floating exchange rate period since 1970 over the last 150 years of fiat money like how many other ways do i have to prove to you that gold is a good diversifying asset you know without you know people finally accepting that that that is the reality um that's out there like it it's it's almost like a know it feels like it's a religious belief that to be denying gold as being a good portfolio diversifier and that it doesn't make a lot of sense yeah i i'm with you i'm with you on that and i think there there's a reason that it you know there are i i think it's there's a reason why macro guys tend to like gold and be they have a more flexible understanding of how to make investments in asset classes at large right like i think a lot of the popular discourse around investing is dominated by equities guys right equities guys and gs who right you know they have this very dogmatic view around how to you know shove something into a dcf and model out their returns and that just feels very comfortable um but i i do think there's there's obviously tons of value in in investing in things like gold or commodities or or whatever it is um and there's there's right i mean certainly yeah yeah certainly commodities i mean um uh you and i might not see eye to eye on bitcoin but i will say this that um the fact that bitcoin doesn't have a yield on it is not a particularly relevant consideration to thinking about whether it's a good storeold of wealth or transaction currency right it's that's not that's not the matter that's not the matter of concern related to it um you know it certainly has plenty of volatility you know that's not problem um yeah so uh so so it's it's um and i think you're right i think part of it i think part of it is like there's a beautiful tangibl of of bonds and their yield and of stocks and their dividends and cash flows and things like that and there is more ambiguity in many ways it seems with things like gold and bitcoin and commodities and and things like that but um but you know we've seen a long track record of of those assets having positive returns and returns that are complementary uh to a portfolio you know to an overall investment portfolio that makes sense for to include them you know not at 100% just you know 10% in commodities and you know in tradeable commodities and gold into a into a 6040 portfolio would meaningfully improve the long-term risk return profile without creating a return a return drag um and so you know that's pretty good trade to make
Where Does U.S. Inflation Stand as of May 2024?,2024-05-09 12:15:01+00:00,7,PSHFMusAP4o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSHFMusAP4o,where do you see the underlying trend of inflation so obviously over the course of the last 12 months or so we've seen this trend of disinflation but in the last three months that started to reverse and you hear you heard chair powell you know today talk about how uh you know they're paying more attention to the data and it's moving in a slightly undesirable direction so and i guess to follow on that well what what do you think about the the sort of trend of inflation right now and then i've got a follow on question about the 2% yeah i mean i think we really um uh when the when the pivot happened last uh winter i it was it was like we had an optimal combination of disinflationary pressures that was driving uh the the the measured inflation number to be at 2% and so you had you know used autos were falling you had gas prices went from $4 a gallon to $3 a gallon um you had you know imported goods prices that were falling pretty rapidly and i think at the time what i said is the problem is we're getting 2% at a point where we have maximum disinflationary impulse from those areas being benefiting from the supply chain resolutions the problem is once those areas that were benefiting no longer were disinf lating as fast right they they prices are still falling in some of those cases but they're just disinf lating not nearly as fast and gas prices turned you know we went from four to three and now we're back up to four on a p to four given uh traded gas prices um that basically resets the level of where we are in inflation and highlights the fact that the sort of underlying um inflationary pressures in the economy are closer to three to four than they are closer to two right which means that that's going to be very challenging unless we create some demand destruction or we get uh a productivity gains you know unusual productivity gains one of those two things has to happen or we will have inflation settle at this sort of three to four% level which is definitely too high for the feds man so all right so we had um uh vincent delard on here the other day and actually he made this call about a year ago but you know he was describing the this idea of it's not um our start i believe it's i start it's the natural rate of inflation and his contention even back then with that it was around three or four percent something like that and you know i guess my question to you is here is does the if let's just say that there is a natural rate of inflation some of those disinflationary impulses that you were saying just bringing more supply back online have stopped and inflation really should be around three or 4 per. does the fed have a the tool belt to actually bring inflation down to 2% if the natural range is higher than that and then b you know would they try to do that because i would imagine that's going to inflict an enormous amount of pain on the economy yeah i mean well the first thing in terms of answering the question do they have the tool b absolutely absolutely like inflation would would not be 3 to 4% if interest rates were 10% right now like so it's just i mean it's just a question of do they want to do it right do they want to inflict the pain necessary to achieve those inflationary outcomes and i think that the challenge is if we're talking about the difference between two and 2.4% i think you know lots of folks i mean who knows i'm measured inflation it's just it's just a measurement it's just some government data it's not like you know the the the truth in you know it's just just some data i think there's there there fed could make the case look if inflation is 2.4% it's pretty close don't worry too much about it we're in the ballpark i think the challeng is if it's really three to four percent then what they then it is too high that that plain and simple it's too high it's not at their mandate they have a problem and you could almost see it with what chairman powell was saying uh earlier today which and what's in the statement uh in the fed statement which is like it's too high you know like unambiguously what's going on right now is too high right we're not going to let it go here if it's two 2.4 2.3 they'll probably let that go and so that's the basic trade-off then the question is what do they have to do to get it there and you know right now they're not doing much you know there's a lot of hope and not a lot of action to bring it down more sustainably to their 2% target so what do you think in terms of this is this is the perennial question that everyone loves to ask right in terms of rate cuts versus rate hikes going going into this year there was an enormous amount of optimism that was being priced in by the market something like six or seven rate cuts and now that's actually swamp and the fed you know with their dot plots was giving us i believe three cuts and now that's actually swung the other way where the fed has stayed relatively constant but the market was pricing in actually fewer uh fewer cuts than that and you've got guys like larry mcdonald who are actually saying that the fed should be hiking rates at the current moment so let me i'll ask you this as a two-part question what do you think the fed is going to do in terms of rate cuts versus rate hikes and what do you think they should do if those are two different answers i think um the answer in terms of what they probably will do is not much and and part of that is um if you've been around a few central bank cycles and looked at central banks across countries across time um i i think uh the there's always a disconnect between what they say that they're going to do and what they actually do like inertia is one of the most powerful forces in central banking and there's always an inclination to do nothing um and gather more data because gathering more data always sounds like a smart idea right everyone wants to gather more data and basically they only act urgently in an environment where it's so clear the economic conditions are meaningfully deteriorating then they act very urgently but like that's not going on right now and so if there's no you know if there's no urgency on economic conditions deteriorating then their national inclination is to do absolutely nothing and that's probably what they'll do and so if you connect it to the market pricing like what's going on right now is you know the markets are pricing in roughly one cut through the end of the year like will they do one cut will they do zero like look i don't you like i got bigger fish to fry than than nitpicking over 25 basis points on uh on suur um i think the much more interesting question is let's say they do nothing is simply holding interest rates where they are enough in order for them to accomplish their goals of bringing inflation durably down to 2% um and i think the answer is probably not that's what we're seeing right now it's probably not enough so they might not do anything it's probably not enough and so what that means is that that you're more likely to get a market based titan
"The U S  Government 10 Year Bond, Why Does it Matter?",2024-05-08 12:15:04+00:00,6,ywq6WbXd74o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywq6WbXd74o,retrospect of the last 18 months and saying hey you know we did a very steep series of rate hikes and basically nothing broke and the economy has been relatively strong and you know most people are starting to coales around this answer that yes on shorter dated yields right uh you know the two-year below and u uh two year below i mean it's been a very steep increase but the longer dated yields haven't moved very much at all um and so like how much emphasis do you put on longer like the 10 year and the 30 year here moving up and is that is that an issue for markets yeah well i i think the the the 10 year and the long end you know out to the 30-y year is the rate that is the most impactful rate on the economy um both uh because it it typically sets the borrowing rate for most borrowers in the economy whether you're borrowing you know for a house or whether you're a corporate borrower at this point you know is much more tilted towards the long end than the short end um although there are some floating rate borrowers that are out there particularly sort of private equity private credit um oriented businesses but mostly the long end is business borrowing as well so that sets the rate for credit creation um and it's gone up enough basically to slow credit creation substantially you know there's basically no no very very little net credit creation in the economy given the current level of interest rates the other thing it does which is probably more impactful these days is that it sets the discount rate of for all financial assets and therefore um if that interest rate rises then it affects basically all financial assets stocks gold commodities everything gets affected by it credit instruments etc and so i think that's where its real effect is is um in uh is it going to put pressure on uh overall assets to fall or is it or is it not putting pressure on overall assets to fall and so you know we saw last summer uh as the 10-year rose through to five uh we saw stocks fall you know 10 or 15% and that gives you a sense as to sort of what the sensitivity is of the economy to uh those higher interest rates so it's a it's a critical component of whether or not um we're going to get an asset price uh decline here and so you know right now the if you look here let me see if i can pull up this this chart of the last um of the tenure over the course of the last year uh you know not that i'm a some kind of ta guy ta guy drawing drawing lines on on charts but i mean it is interesting to watch uh it you know yield spiked at over 5% back in november of this last year and it looked like it sort of bottom there and it's been steadily climbing and now we're at back above 46 and admittedly uh you know the the 10 year and the two-year both sold off uh today after the fomc which again was probably interpreted as relatively dubish but it does look like yields are starting to climb back up and i get you know i guess my question to you be to you would be do you see a sustained rally here or are yields going to turn back around do you think yeah well i think the the trouble and it sort of connects with the the issuance point that we were talking about before is that um is that every day what's happening is the the government is coming to the market issuing bonds and issuing bonds and issuing bonds and every day they've got to get somebody to buy those bonds and how do you get somebody to buy those bonds well you have to get them to buy it at a higher yield or a lower price and so that's essentially what we're seeing here is it's like uh it's like water drip torture on the bond market that that day-to-day flood you know that day-to-day issuance of bonds and i think one of the challenges is because it's such a big issue the treasury is such a big issuer that um no one can front run it like you know you you i could tell you that the treasury is gna issue you know $3 trillion do of gross coupons over the course of the end of you know between now and the end of the year and like who's got the balance sheet to to preposition for that like basically no one and so that's why it ends up being like it feels a little um it it feels a little uh disappointing when these things happen because you're like ah nothing really happened in the market that day and then every day you come in you see these pressures on bond yields that we've seen you know in in the you know for the last uh you know since the start of the year yeah and so where where do you think this ends because you if you look at estimates from i mean even the the cbo the congressional budget office i mean all you see is right continue it i think it's something like $2 trillion a year that has to get funded from somewhere where it's going to be the treasury issuing more and more yields so do do you or more and more bonds so do you see sort of consistent pressure on yields to go higher from here um and if so like how does that sort of doom loop stop well i think we're in a we're in a challenging point because um the yield rises that we've seen so far are enough to start to cap asset price appreciation which we've seen you know stocks have basically peaked and traded sideways to down a little bit but the yields are not high enough to create a slowdown in the economy which would then start to create a demand or a bid for those bonds you know say relative to stocks and so in this transition period it's it's almost like we're in um you know in a gap we're try we're we're moving through a a an air pocket where stocks are too high and bond yields aren't quite high enough to create the easing to then turn them around and so you need to get bon yelds to move up enough to create enough pain on stocks to create the easing to then create the bid for bonds um that's you know that's how these that's how these markets work is they're reflexive in that nature right you know and and so um we probably need bond yields in the five five and a half range to start to get enough of that slowdown in the economy to start to make sense to then go long those bonds so we're we're uh we're in an empty spot right now it seems
Seemingly Inconsistent Fed Action,2024-05-07 12:15:02+00:00,7,B0m-iGdvWKI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0m-iGdvWKI,maybe just starting at a really high level we were talking a little bit beforehand about um a little bit of of confusion in trying to get a sense of where the fed is really at um and so i'd love to get your opinion on just what their where their headp space is at the current moment but maybe could you give for listeners who might not might have missed it just a summary of uh this fomc where we're sort of the san points and then we can get into the context throughout it yeah well i think you know uh there's basically two uh important points i think that i took away from uh from the fo mc meeting from a policy standpoint the first was at least uh an acknowledgment in uh the statement that uh the progress towards uh getting inflation back to their mandate uh has stalled um you know which i think is a very uh conservative way of recognizing that uh the data over the course of the last couple of months has certainly at at a minimum been inconsistent with getting more confidence and probably uh indicating that uh inflation may be moving in the wrong direction relative to their mandate and then i think the second uh matter of course they they kept interest rates uh constant because that's what everyone expected and and they largely just adhere to the basic expectations that come uh coming into the meeting um but the the the main policy change was uh tapering the qt the pace of qt um which is a little confusing mismash of uh of of directional words which basically means right now uh they're letting the balance sheet roll off for uh treasury bonds uh at about 60 billion uh a month uh in terms of what's maturing and they're going to slow that and only allow about 25 billion uh to roll off uh a month and so uh there was some expectation that they were going to slow the pace of quantitative tightening um but on the margin i'd say this was you know probably the median expectation was about uh 30 they were going to go from 60 to 30 and here they announced going from 60 to 25 so you know a little a little more doish than you know very muchly more doish than what people expected from a policy standpoint so that's the basic announcements it's i i'd say in terms of a take it's kind of an interesting combination of things you know most people expected some sort of shift in quantitative tightening uh to slow that pace coming into this meeting either this meeting or the next one so it wasn't that wasn't much of a surprise but is pretty weird for the fed to basically say we're going to uh engage in an easing action by slowing the pace of qt at the same time they're basically ramping up their rhetoric to highlight the fact that uh they're getting further away from their inflation mandate and and so those two things you know uh easing while becoming farther away from your inflation goals you know is at best a bit inconsistent uh and at worst probably imprudent uh in terms of a policy mix that we're seeing so bob what do you think is driving that policy makx i we're going to talk about the qra as well and there's been an enormous amount of focus on the treasury and fiscal at large but what do you think is is driving this particularly sort of confusing move well i think there there are folks in the fed who um who are at least making the case related to the balance sheet that um that uh engaging in quantitative easing which is you know the outright purchase of longer data treasury bonds uh is an is a functionally an easing in the markets and you can imagine why which is basically when you buy treasury bonds it both depresses the yield on those bonds which is stimulative and also provides more money that gets injected into the financial economy um and so there's folks in the fed who argue that that is an easing buying bonds is an easing but at the same time argue that um that letting the balance sheet roll down is not a tightening and so from that stance um you know the the officials and and to be frank with you that doesn't make a lot of sense to me because to the extent that um bonds are maturing long dated bonds are maturing on their balance sheet and then are not repurchased by the fed to keep their balance sheet constant it means someone in the private sector has to buy those bonds which means that they have to trade at a higher yield or a lower price in order for someone to be incentivized to go buy those bonds when they get reissued so that doesn't make sense but you know the fed heads really think that that's that's how monetary policy works you know frankly without a lot of uh empirical evidence or common sense evidence uh to support their case and so from the fed's perspective slowing the pace of qt is effectively they're viewing it as not a monetary policy activity um e even though i think it is and um and what they're really worried about with quantitative tightening is that by rolling down the balance sheet they're reducing the amount of liquidity in the system um and i'm sure folks who uh you listen to this on a regular basis uh are often uh often hear about you know various measures of liquidity in the system particularly uh the rrp um which you know gives some indication of excess liquidity or excess reserves in the system um where you know there's some indication that if quantitative tightening rolls off then that rrp will fall over time uh which would then create less excess liquidity in the system initially in the r rp and then eventually as quantitative tightening you know as keeps going would eventually start to create a a fall in bank reserves and chairman pal i mean acknowledged very specifically in the meeting in the presser how uh he's very concerned about what happened in the 2018 period where there was a liquidity problem um and weren't wasn't enough reserves in the system for the banks which created a spike in repo and other short rate markets so they're very very concerned about that so from their perspective you're getting in their head they see slowing qt as having no monetary impact no monetary policy impact and is helping uh deal with that uh liquidity problem that could exist were it to continue uh at its current pace
Macroeconomic Story Remains The Same Despite Latest Jobs Report,2024-05-06 12:15:02+00:00,2,IFCi7vQXEIQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFCi7vQXEIQ,"joining us now is 314 research co-founder warren pies and unlimited ceo and cio bob elliot guys happy friday bob we had tough macro news that keeping yields high and pressuring stocks and then decent earnings boosting some stocks and now good macro news so what do you say what does it what does it look like to you from here well i think a lot of the key themes from the macro perspective that have been in place for the last few months are still firmly in place i mean the employment report uh still showed you know 175,000 jobs it's pretty good uh if you look at the last three months that's 240,000 jobs and that you know is about the same that we've seen over the last 18 months which has averaged about 250,000 jobs the unemployment rate was essentially flat month over month you put that all together uh and you see something uh that continues the picture of pretty good growth uh coming out of the us and that continuing uh at the same time that those inflationary pressures they aren't yet resolved and without resolving those inflationary pressures it's going to be pretty tough for the fed to give the type of easing that the equity market is looking for oh"
The Fed Plays the Waiting Game,2024-05-03 12:15:03+00:00,7,fvJGM7z-r18,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvJGM7z-r18,but like what is the fed going to do here i mean are they just going to keep pushing this out and out and out um into the future nothing the fed is going to do nothing uh and i think uh i think you know if you've if you uh if you've been through a few fed cycles in your career um you know i think the the sort of two things that um the reaction function let's say of the fed is often to do nothing until there is such a significant growth or inflation dynamic that it motivates them to move rapidly and so what you know it's very typical to see these periods where essentially nothing happens for you know it can happen for years on end because as long as growth conditions don't deteriorate there really is no motivation like why if you're in the fed shoes right now like why would you change monetary policy like what what would be the reason like unemployment's and secular lows you know growth is fine uh and on the margin inflation is a little too high relative to what you what you'd like to see why would you cut when you could just sit and wait and i think that's what we're seeing you know that's that's sort of the big um the sort of big surprise i think to the market really in the last couple years is that particularly when you comes to pricing in the short pricing and what's in the short rate market you know expectations have been wildly you know all over the place in terms of expecting huge cuts and then hikes and then cuts you know and today we're about zero when in reality like what's happened over the last 18 months is like not much right really not much so no not much is going with on with the economy and not much is going on with the fed and so you know we've got this like not much world but expectations are wildly moving around everywhere right and so the trade has been to fade the expectations not to run with them yeah i mean i can't really come up with the only argument i've heard to cut and i don't think it's it's really valid anymore because we've seen inflation come up is the idea that if if they think and you're going to tell me they're probably not but if they think they actually are very tight where they are right now and they want to stick the landing and they see inflation coming down they would want to ease into it as opposed to what they usually do which is something goes horribly wrong they cut a lot um but i get i think unfortunately that's probably not valid anymore i mean inflation's going up not down so there there's probably not much of a case to be doing any cutting right now i don't know if you agree with any of that that i just said yeah well i i think a lot of people you know uh particularly those who are asset holders really hoped that what was being said by uh some governors you know i i call them the real raiders um was uh was was true and sort of forgot the fact that like it doesn't really matter whether the fed thinks monetary policy is tight or easy it really doesn't the fed responds to the data that it sees if growth is okay and inflation is too high then you know at a minimum it doesn't do anything maybe it hikes but at a minimum it doesn't do anything um it you know they can they and the 500 quants with phds can sit around and you know pontificate about whether monetary policy is tight or easy it doesn't make any difference it doesn't make any difference what makes a difference is what's going on with growth and what's going on in in inflation and so you got to focus on those things because that what's going to determine their policy to be clear like the real rate situation in terms of you know the the fed's view of real rates today is basically no different than it was four months ago when everyone thought that there were going to be seven cuts right the thing that's been different is measured inflation is a little too hot and growth continues to be pretty good right that's what that's what's going on and that's what's motivate motivating their behavior too many people way too focused on some random academic theories being promoted by these governors it' be so much better if they just stopped talking um then people wouldn't be confused by their totally misleading either expectations of future conditions or their misleading frameworks of how the decision-making works i'm just curious when we think out longer term like structural inflation um you know we've had these forces that have driven inflation down you know technology being one uh globalization was one in the past um and demographics like those are kind of the reasons we're always given as to why inflation was low for such a long period of time like when we come out of this period i mean do you think those are different now i mean do you think we have like a higher level of long-term structural inflation than we did in the period before uh we may or may not have higher structural inflation really it comes down to whether whether the fed or the central banks in the developed world uh want to choose to accept a higher level of inflation or if they're willing or or if what they're going to do is constrain nominal demand relative to what it would have been otherwise um in order to keep inflation down and and the reason why i i say that is um it's clear that some of the big disinflationary pressures that have been so beneficial over the last 20 years are are not repeatable you know china entered the wto that's not going to happen again um you know we had a massive boom in crossb trade where production went to the cheapest to produce areas of the world that's not going to happen again um we had honestly we had you know 30 years of of the most peaceful uh time in you know us or in global history over the last thousand years in the last 30 years um you know maybe that happens but it sure looks like we're moving in the opposite direction and so you put all those things together and and the disinflationary impulses that existed before are unlikely to persist into the future i think the interesting question is what is the central bank do about that because part of why we were able to have such high real growth in in the '90s and and 2000s was because uh you know central banks were getting the dividend the peace and disinflation dividend and so they let economies run hotter than they otherwise would be but if that's not there are they going to choose to to constrain economic growth or are they going to let inflation run hot i mean so far they've let inflation run hot
Why is the U S  Economy Resilient? (in April 2024),2024-05-02 12:15:05+00:00,8,Pb3jJf6Attg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb3jJf6Attg,yeah there's been some interesting like developments macroeconomy related it seems like you know inflation is coming in maybe a little bit hotter or stickier and growth looks like it's coming in a little bit slower i don't know what the gd print was like 1.6 versus two something if i'm getting the numers somewhat right in there so i'm just you know and i think the market is somewhat reacting to that it seems like um and just can you give us an over all view of where you think we are economically yeah i mean i think from a from an overall economy perspective we're still very late cycle unemployment rates at secular lows um you know income growth as a function of that is uh still relatively elevated which is leading to nominal spending that's too high relative to the productive capacity of the economy and the combination of that means that inflation is still elevated um above what the fed's target is i think um you know i think the the resilience of the economy has surprised many folks given that we've basically have been at this higher rate environment you know for 18 months or so and um you know there's nooks and crannies of the economy that are weaker uh for sure uh you know if you're a loss making you know debt ladened private equity backed company life's a little tough for you but if you're um you know if you're a cash flowing business uh if you're a big business um you know if you're a household that's got you know decent income growth you know you're employed decent income growth and a 3% mortgage uh and your 401k zooming up and your house price going up things are going pretty well um and so i think that all speaks to the sustainability of this current expansion being much more fueled by income growth than most of the expansions that we've seen in our careers which are much more debt oriented expansions and you know incom driven expansions they can last a long time there's no there's no unsus unsustainable activity when you have an incom driven expansion the way that we're having it yeah so that's a big part of the resiliency is this income levels have stayed up employment has stayed relatively healthy in most areas and so people have money coming in consumers are spending money because you know it is if you think of it to your point it's like how much rates moved the cost of borrowing you know you would have thought that would have had more there would have been more pain in different areas there's there's pockets of it commercial real estate in certain areas even though that's being so yeah it's it's interesting how resilon it's been yeah and i think i think um in many ways uh this expansion i think a lot of people find this expansion to be very confusing uh and then they're sort of uh like fumbling around to find you know the explanatory dynamic that's going on oh it must be you know fiscal but the fiscal position in the us is actually the deficits actually been contracting for the last couple years or it must be interest that's funding everything but you know that has added at most 50 basis points of gdp growth over the last few years you know people are fumbling around they don't understand it and that's because the cycle we're experiencing today is actually much more akin to the um the oldtime cycles of like the 50s and the 60s where you have these sort of income based expansions and they're quite persistent and it doesn't mean that monetary policy is totally ineffective um it has its its effect to some extent but when you have borrowing as soft as it already is um it's it the borrowing channel uh is not going to be the big channel for creating the slowdown in the economy basically what's what has to happen is interest rates have to rise enough to start to create a dragon asset prices and that drag on asset prices will then create a desire to save more uh and spend less and that that'll create a slowing of spending which will create a deterioration of earnings which will create a deterioration in employment but you know when we look at that cycle like where are we you know we squint at the s&p 500 every day like we're not at peak but heck we're you know percentage points below peak and um we look at house prices they just keep going up right for most people you know hardly a flesh wound there in terms of the tightening that's gone on so far on twitter you outlined a framework where you articulated a way that inflation ultimately might get might get uh stomped out here can you just talk about what that what that was yeah others have uh that you've talked to earlier today have slightly more elaborate uh you know works uh that they've created scripts they've created uh you're talking the acts of the play i like the acts of the play that's right the acts of the play um which you know much respect for andy everyone should read the acts of the play i'm more of a like fits in one tweet kind of guy you know so you know basically what has to happen in terms of the ordering ordering matters i i i wrote this back when people were like well i should buy bonds because eventually there'll be a recession and i'm like no no no that's not how it works you have to think about the ordering and the ordering is that interest rates have to rise and then asset prices fall and then spending slows and then earnings deteriorate and then hiring deteriorates and then spending slows and we get that negative self-reinforcing dynamic and that once there's a enough slowing of nominal spending growth relative to the productive capacity of the economy that will start to create a slowing of inflationary pressures both because you know wages will come down um and the overall nominal demand will also come down with it leading to you know price pressures that are softening and and and so far we basically we're just not there like if you look at what's going on with nominal gdp growth no f you know if you look at um end demand which is different from gdp gdp is you know whether there's inventories or not and whether it's foreign demand or not it's not that important like if you're trying to understand sort of the durability of the economy you want to look at you know final sales to of domestic producers or you want to look at you know end demand nominal demand domestic uh demand and if you look at those you know basically we've been in this five or 6% nominal demand range for a while right and it's and it's no surprise that that is happening at a time when wages and salary growth from the from the pce report are also showing 6% so we've got essentially 6% growth in wages and salaries 6% growth in spending roughly stable savings rate and a nominal gdp growth at the aggregate economy level of about 6% okay well you know there you go like it's it it all ties out very nicely um and that that will persist until there's a good reason for people to stop spending
How Could An Asset Allocator View Bitcoin?,2024-05-01 12:15:02+00:00,4,ChzQnd2QsC4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChzQnd2QsC4,bob you've done some of the best work with respect to looking at bitcoin a you know as a risk asset more correlated with say you know the nasdaq and you know that side of the tech tech world versus say you know the traditional gold maybe you could talk to us about you know that's obviously an evolving trade of bitcoin but where's the dna of bitcoin right now yeah i mean i think one of the key questions for any allocator and really for any widespread invest adoption and someone has to sit there and understand where and how bitcoin behaves relative to their overall asset portfolio and i think that's one of the challenges of more widescale adoption is you know what when does bitcoin go up and when does it go down is uh pretty uncertain in terms of uh when you're thinking about it from an investment allocators perspective i think of anything what we've seen is we've seen an increase in the idiosyncrasy of the return related to bitcoin um you know whereas a couple years ago it basically looked like you know the q's times three or something like that uh the fact that we've seen the market action that we have and the magnitude of the market action connected to the bitcoin the spot bitcoin etf um dynamics over the course of the last year have made it even more idiosyncratic um and so i think if anything while the bitcoin um uh issuance the spot bitcoin etf issuance has been very valuable in creating an inf infrastructure it's been detrimental to understanding how the asset transacts um because it's made it more uh idiosyncratic in terms of its returns and so my guess is over time we'll sort of get back to something sort of more normal stability once the sort of initial flows that come from that play out i think even in the last to be honest with you the last couple weeks it kind of feels that way a little bit that we're kind of getting back to the norm um and if it's just if it ends up being primarily a different risk asset well that has a use in a portfolio like in the same way the cues have a use in your portfolio but it isn't necessarily quite as attractive uh as gold from a diversifying perspective if it remains so correlated to tech you know to like tech or or uh or risk assets i mean is an example you're talking about i'm thinking of the idiosyncratic nature of it lately is how with these geopolitical tensions gold was going up bitcoin was going down yeah that's not you would expect if it's a store of value right i think i think um many people have proposed that bitcoin is a uh will protect you against geopolitical will protect an investor against geopolitical risk and i think the challenge with that uh thesis is it's not a fundamental thesis it's a empirical thesis in the sense of you have to observe how people respond when you see those circumstance emerge circum ances emerge and i think if anything actually what we've seen is a bit of a step back along that dimension if you go back you know back to the ukraine uh the russian russian invasion of ukraine bitcoin did seem to trade a little bit positive to geopolitical risk meaning as the risk was increasing bitcoin went up um and i think this more recent period with the conflicts that have emerged in the middle east we've seen bitcoin trade closer to a risk asset in the short term and that um that certainly looks like it's moving further away from being that that geopolitical risk hedge as its adoption has become more widespread
What do the Latest Developments in Bitcoin Ecosystem Mean?,2024-04-30 12:15:05+00:00,6,sS8y5JEYcns,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS8y5JEYcns,we get to we kind of we look at them at bitcoin from a similar place i feel like well we're not bitcoin maxis but we're willing to definitely give it a good chance so i just wanted to follow up with you now since we last spoke we've had developments in the bitcoin ecosystem have they made you number one warmer or hotter on bitcoin as a store of value digital gold number two bitcoin is a currency a medium of exchange would love to get your take here yeah i mean i think the biggest thing i'd say from the perspective of an investor is the issuance or creation of these spot bitcoin etfs really does change the picture in terms of the protections that individual investors have in order to invest in the product you know the the etfs particularly those issued by bigname institutions either explicitly or implicitly have guarantees that if various issues come up related to the custody of those assets that odds are those companies are going to back the those those products and ensure that customers are made whole and that's a pretty big deal considering one of the biggest issues in the space over the last decade has been a question of whether or not people uh were actually you know having had the exposures that they were expecting when using other intermediaries so pretty much changes the picture there yeah it gets rid of a lot of the friction and sticking points that an investor would have especially like wealth managers to to put a client in into into digital assets that that's exactly right and so i think what it does is it opens up the opportunity to say uh you know for the uh for the the folks who are curious about bitcoin want to start to leg in a little bit you know the the essentially the cost of doing so in terms of just buying an etf in your brokerage account it's just a lot lower than going and setting up an account you know a third party and it's not related to your existing assets and how exactly do you hold it now of course there were other options out there like the grayscale bitcoin trust um but without necessarily the protections that exist in the etf structure with big you know uh trading well above or below uh the fair market value of the asset and um and and so this and actually at you know considerably higher costs you know now we're talking about investing in bitcoin at 25 basis points of fees so totally change the picture there and i think what we're seeing is we're seeing some incremental interest directly as a result of that i think the real question is is it good enough to be a primary cornerstone of people's ass asset portfolio and the volatility so far it's not quite there yet and so that's what we're seeing you know bob i'm gonna dig into that i want to start first on the transaction costs since the having and ask you what that may mean for bitcoin's chances becoming an actual functional currency so we've seen that trans action costs have gone up it looks like they're kind of unrealistic for any smaller transactions i mean you're not buying a coffee the fees are too high have what you've seen posst having transaction cost just friction cost does it make it less likely or more likely that bitcoin could ever be like a currency with transactions built in well i think um i mean there's a lot of other experts in the world of bitcoin that are probably more knowledgeable than me i think the main question i like your angle i like where you come because you're you're not a maxi looking at it as an asset allocator and so it's a very yeah i mean i think i think the basic question is um in order to be a currency the transaction cost of a currency has to be very low right obviously like the transaction cost if you have a $100 bill in your pocket is zero right because you know you just hand it to somebody and i think when you start you just hand it to that's that easy right um or you know swiping a credit card you know the transaction costs there are a few percent i think the the challenge with it being being a um a transacting currency is exactly what we see here which is the pace in which the transactions occur and the fees that it takes now i'm sure there's going to be a lot of folks working hard to figure out ways to reduce these for smaller scale transactions but until we get an environment where uh people can reliably believe that the transaction costs of uh can be both can be very low i mean like 1% and the transactions can be immediate it's going to be very challenging for it to serve as a transactional currency now i'd separate that from being a um an intermediary to transition wealth that is something particularly in environment you know where you're talking about larger amounts right you're not talking about buying a slice of pizza you're trying to talking about preserve your savings say in an economy where there's uh questionable ability to save in banks and things like that that's where you might be willing to pay a more meaningful transaction cost to move a larger amount and you might also be not so sensitive about transacting instantaneously but transacting over time and so you put those things together and i actually think you know that part of it still remains even if the smallscale transactions are no longer uh are are have yet to be proven out sufficiently to make sense to do
What Path Do Rate Hikes and Asset Prices Have to Follow to Slow Down the U.S. Economy?,2024-04-29 12:15:01+00:00,6,D1fbOoXHrCQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1fbOoXHrCQ,"bob i just want to move a little bit on to your um your look outlook on interest rates because you post some great stuff on that and you should we see in real time how you have a pragmatic data driven view on rates so it looks like you know a few months ago everyone was the the market was pricing in a number of cuts now it's gone to a point where the probability of actual rate hikes not cuts is no longer just a tail wrist if you look at market pricing so i'm just curious at what point does the probability of hikes start to impact asset prices do you think yeah i mean i think we we um we had a unique constellation of events over the first quarter where expectations of us growth were very weak um and expectations were that the fed would cut monet you know cut interest rates relatively significantly through the course of 2024 and in the first quarter um a bunch of data basically came in and showed that the us economy was pretty strong all things considered you know even up through today's data with very very strong household spending uh the challenge you know and that was a big important driver of why stocks rallied through the first quarter was because growth was much stronger than people expected but now expectations of growth in the us over the course of 2024 are now at 2 and a half percent two and a half perc real growth in the us is pretty darn strong i mean that's about about as as good as you're going to get in a late cycle environment and so that has set expectations very high we also have earnings growth that's expected to be 17% year-over-year by the fourth quarter that those are very high expectations in terms of growth so it's going to be hard for equities to meet that um in an and and that's happening at the same time that there's this pressure for interest rates to rise and and i i wrote something yesterday which i said we're we're in a bit of an airpocket which is that interest rates have risen enough to put a lid on the ability for stocks to meaningfully make new highs but those interest rates haven't risen enough to create enough of a drag on the econom to shift over to an easing cycle and so we're in a difficult position when it comes to risk assets both bonds and stocks because we're not quite you know things are not quite bad enough to get that easing that will help you know create a re acceleration but they're not quite good enough relative to the expectations to keep asset prices going so if you were to have like kind of a a red zone for rates say like the 10year is it somewhere around the 5% range you'd start to get worried about what will happen to asset price yeah i mean i think giving us uh last last fall was a good sense of what was going on we had interest rates touch 5% we had stocks fall to 4,100 and that was a very short period of time and had a relatively swift response from the treasury and the fed to ease monetary policy or at least indicate that they were going to ease policy um and we didn't quite get the growth slowdown that was expected but we were on a path to get there um if interest rates had stayed at the same level and stocks had continued to decline even modestly and so i think those are sort of the targets when you start to get rates that are going to be you know at 5% or above for more than just a moment you know for months and you start to see stocks fall something like 10 15% from their highs that's sort of where you start to get the types of dynamics that would typically create a turn in the economy um and we're not there yet is is the reality both on bond yields and also on um on stock price gotcha now i just want to move on you made a quick comment on on earnings how a lot of good times are priced in so are you thinking if basically earnings expectations are kind of price to perfection where i saw a good chart that i can throw up that shows some of the basically the mag 7 earnings growth versus the rest of the s&p 500 you see mag 7 growing strongly now supposed to decelerate but still be growing pretty well but then the rest of the s&p will be picking up and be the strongest growth in 4q so does that introduce risks to you like how do you characterize when you see this where are the risks in in this type of chart yeah i mean i i think it's it's pretty hard you know the us economy is doing pretty well um but its growth is at you know its nominal growth is at 6% a year which means that essentially the topline growth in the econ in in earnings right the sales growth in earnings is about 6% a year you can't really get away from that it's not totally exactly right because they can take you know they can take uh share slide three next next slide this is the one that he's talking to they can take share from you know private companies they can take share from abroad but i think in general it's pretty darn hard to grow meaningfully earnings much more than sort of six to 10% if we have that sort of 177% or 18% earnings growth and you know gdp growth is growing at something like uh 6% and margins are already at you know pretty close to secular highs the combination of events that need to occur to get you to the that you know 17 to 20% earnings growth by the end of the year it's it's pretty tough to pencil out what exactly is going to do that so the expectations are very very high considering um you know a macroecon you know they need something meaningfully better than the already pretty darn good macroeconomy that we've got right now"
Portfolio Diversification in Inflationary Periods,2024-04-26 12:15:01+00:00,2,KE3nbWYcFlc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE3nbWYcFlc,uh bob if we look at the ramifications for asset allocation sort of through the lens of the highly inflationary period in the late 70s and early 80s what are some of the lessons learned from an asset allocation perspective through such highly inflationary periods yeah i mean i think i think the biggest thing is um most portfolios most portfolios if you look at how they're built today strategically we're talking we're sort of talking constructing a a beta portfolio sort of putting our alpha views on the side if you look at beta portfolios today they're basically built on the lessons learned from 1985 to 2020 um or 2022 right like that's kind of how they're built and how are they built they're basically bonds and stocks which were a great set of portfolio diversifiers over time um over that period and in a disinflationary cycle that's exactly the portfolio you want to hold but i think it's really important to recognize that that is a terrible portfolio through an inflationary cycle um and the vast majority of everyday investors are totally unprepared to experience this dynamic um because they're not holding assets that would typically do pretty well in inflation upswing as well as the downswing following an inflation upswing so things like commodities uh you know um industrial commodities oil gold um and that sort of combination of assets is going to do better than a set of assets that's highly concentrated in disinflation in in a dis disinflationary uh cycle now to be clear that doesn't mean that assets in general are going to do well it just means if you're going to protect yourself as well as possible you're going to want to have that portfolio of assets so
"The Path of Productivity, Demographics and Debt in Mature Economies",2024-04-25 12:15:01+00:00,5,JkQcrcFzOY8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkQcrcFzOY8,you know the first thing you want to start with is is basically let's call it the longer term productivity cycle which drives you know any anytime you're thinking about growth over a you know 20 30 year time frame that's productivity is the main thing that drives what's going on and you we've we've basically um i think the thing that you typically see is the productivity particularly in advanced western economies is pretty stable over time you know there's some fluctuation here and there but by and large productivity is consistent uh and that most of the uh evolution of productivity that you see or the the changes in productivity are more cyclically driven and driven by other factors rather than real true productivity dynamics i do think there's a big you know that being said there is a productivity cycle particularly in the context of a global of a of a um in particularly in the context of the development of an overall like a societal development which is in the west let's just say the developed west we've gone from you know 75 years ago being uh innovative and hardworking to being less innovative and less hardworking today and so you'd expect productivity to moderate so the types of productivity gains that existed you know in the 50s 60s and 70s are unlikely to persist so we're seeing productivity slow to sort of that you know oneish percent kind of level you know take labor force growth at close to zero in most western developed uh economies and productivity growth about one you actually don't need that much economic growth to have some tightening in the overall market and i think that context is actually somewhat important when we think about what's going on you know today which is you see places like europe or the us put up gdp numbers of you know 0 one 2% that is very different y that's not that bad is the grand scheme of things and very different from where we were say 20 years ago when a 1% growth rate or a 0% growth rate was actually quite a contractionary dynamic and so it creates some risks around using previous cycles as benchmarks to looking at today's cycle so you take that sorry bob if i could just interrupt you for one sec there when we're thinking about these you know these labor force growth rates is a lot of that just due to demographics yeah that's just a demographic issue okay um and you know on the margin uh advanced western economies could possibly increase immigration to the extent that it could be beneficial to their labor force growth but those things are pretty on the margin there you know the big the big picture story for most of these economies is that they have aging populations and the result of an aging population is you get um you get lower labor force growth and there for overall lower uh low lower overall growth lower nominal growth and real growth on a structural basis that actually ties nicely to the debt cycle because typically the way that uh economies that are in the later stages of uh labor and productivity cycle is you typically start borrowing to make up for the fact that you can no longer produce as high a rate as you did before to maintain a continued standard of living and that's really what we've done in um in the advanced western economies over the course of the last say 30 or 40 years it was obviously helped a great deal by the fact that you had a secular decline in interest rates uh as inflation became more controlled relative to where it was back in the 60s and 70s and that helped stimulate an incredible amount of debt growth and that debt growth basically flowed into a fair amount of consumption maintaining consumption growth that was stronger than underlying productivity plus labor force growth and also flowed a lot into asset prices
Why is this Economic Cycle Clouded with Uncertainty?,2024-04-24 12:15:00+00:00,4,3g7wiG2r4BE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g7wiG2r4BE,and one of the things that is really um challenging in this cycle is that you have a circumstance where um we have not seen a traditional business cycle really since 2000 and even that was a bit of a a a bubble pop cycle more than you know it was it was a bit of traditional cycle and a bit of a bubble pop so you know what are we talking about like late 80s early 90s is the last time we've had a more traditional business cycle and i think in that context it's it's very uncertain there's a lot of uncertainty about how all of these dynamics play through if us economy as an example restructured substantially following the financial crisis a move away from floating rate mortgages uh a lot of companies basically went from b borrowing on on the short end primarily to extending duration locking in low interest rates for a long time and so there are reasons on that side why you might think that the sensitivity of the economy is lower today to interest rates relative to what it was in the past at the same time debt levels are higher than they were you know certainly in 2000 or back in the late 80s and early 90s and so you may think the economy is more sensitive to the interest rate dynamics and so you you see these big cross cutting forces and frankly the big thing is it's unknown it is anyone who tells you it is certainly this way or certainly that way is too conf a lot of ambiguity so what is the right terminal rate to start to ease inflation pressures it could be three it could be five or could be seven or could be 11 it's hard to know and so in a lot of ways when you're navigating through the cycle the key thing that i think you have to do is you have to be very hold very true to the data and what you're seeing in the data because it's telling you it's giving you feedback on here's how much they've tightened here's how it's flowing through is it actually doing enough is it not and how is that working and operating you got to operate agile in this environment you can't you can't just say well there's been a lot of hiking and therefore you know and the yield curves inverted and therefore you know what we're going immediately into recession the reality is lots of people who did that have gotten burned because they used frankly indicators and dynamics that had existed years and years ago to try and assert certainty around the fact that we were on a certain economic path and the reality is that it's a lot more ambiguous than that um so that's a probably an unsatisfying answer to your question there's a lot lot more uncertainty than there was in the past i i think the the the the basic premise that we should take from that answer is as as you said we have to be nimble and we have to keep learning right we have to keep our minds open to continuing changes within the economy and each of these inputs and how they affect every piece of the economy exactly exactly
What Are Debt Cycles?,2024-04-23 12:15:03+00:00,4,nQ4r6eThQKI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ4r6eThQKI,reading from some of the as i said the twitter thread that is pinned to the top of your your profile which i think is is excellent and it's it says when debts can't rise faster than money and income forever there are limits to debt growth think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bubble there's a limited amount of it that you can use to get an extra boost but you can't live on it forever in the case of debt you can take it out before you put it in i.e you don't have any debt and you can take it out but you are expected to turn return what you took out and it continues a little later when debt can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time of paying back comes the process works in reverse it is that dynamic that creates long-term debt cycles these long-term debt cycles have existed for as long as there has been credit even the old testament described the need to wipe out debt once every 50 years which was called the year of the jubilee so what would a debt jubilee look like well i think uh you know we're not we're probably not going to have a debt uh jubilee um in in this context uh we don't quite have the centralized authority of the uh of the old testament days um but uh but i do think it what that what that highlights is the uh is the overall dynamic which is yeah we you know depending on exactly which economy you're talking about there's been a great deal of leveraging up over the course of the last 30 or 40 years and that was exacerbated in the last 15 by an era of frankly money that was you know uh incredibly you know it's the the greatest monetary stimulation in economies you know in the past hundreds of years right and so you had the circumstance where basically the debt cycle was um we sort of let's say in the us context reached the peak of our debt cycle from the private sector's perspective in 2008 right with the with the housing crisis etc that then created a circumstance where you know borrowers could no longer take on a whole bunch of debt relative to their incomes and what did that mean well you know the us had 15 years of stagnant growth as a function of that very low real growth and part of the way in which that played out is that the central banks there's no jubilee right almost always there's no jubile but one of the tools that central banks can use in monetary systems that are fiat based is to print money to basically offset the deflationary forces of debt so that you don't get uh debt contraction so typically the way this would work in an environment where the central bank let's say you were on a gold standard just as a as a as a context what would typically happen is that people would start to build up debts right and that would be expansionary and then at some point right the the dynamic the debt dynamic would start to to compress and people would have to pay back those debts but as they pay back those debts their spending becomes lower than their incomes which then you know someone spending is just another person's income which creates the downward spiral of a debt contraction and so that's why if you go back to say the 1800s or the early 1900s you see a lot of these waves of uh you know debt expansions and then you know they reach limits and then you have big debt contractions you you have a debt expansion for 20 years and a big debt contraction for 20 or 30 years and up and down and up and down and that is very you know that's that's destabilizing structurally destabilizing
What Were The Economic Dynamics of The Great Depression?,2024-04-22 12:15:05+00:00,4,XHxZqBSCYi4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHxZqBSCYi4,the great depression it seems to me like many of the solutions that the government and the central bankers intervened with actually exacerbated the problems that the economy and the markets were facing is this a fair judgment the depression dynamic at sort of two different periods one where the response to financial instability or or financial deterioration was um we should tighten our belts right and i think that that's actually quite a the the reason why you often see uh you often see folks in central banks facing a debt to leveraging cycle initially respond using that set of tools is because for any one individual that's the rational choice right the rational choice is if you've borrowed too much and you're spending too much relative to your income then what you should do is you should reduce your spending relative to your income and pay back debs right that that actually like from an intuition perspective makes a lot of sense right there's there's reasons why when people see the government borrowing too much they say what we should really do is implement austerity right the problem with and and that was like i mean it wasn't just um just to be clear like it's not just oh those silly people back in the 20s implemented austerity in response to uh debt leveraging like europe did exactly the same thing in the two in the 2010s right so it's not like this is you know some uh totally foreign way of approaching it it's very typical it's a very typical way of approaching it the problem with that is that it fails to take into consideration that you know one person's spending is another person's income and if you if everyone is tightening their belt at the same time then you have this core problem that everyone is trying to cut their spending all the same time which is cutting everyone's incomes which is having second and third order effects and so this is typically what you see if you see the initial move to austerity thinking that that will solve the problem because of that individual intuition it creates it it exacerbates the problem right and as a function of that then you get into a worse problem and when you get into that worse problem the only solution to that problem and this is really what's call the second half of the depression period is the only way to deal with that problem is to uh is is to reify in one form or another right and so that involves uh you know there's a bunch of different steps to to deal with that but things like money printing which is more in the modern context or back in the in the in the 30s context devaluing money relative to gold which is really devaluing money relative to stuff right the productive the real productive capacity of all the stuff in the economy allowed people to get out of that negative downward spiral the key question is you want to do that you want to do enough of that to offset the deflationary force but you don't want don't want to do so much of it that it creates a circumstance where money is being devalued too much and you start to run into issues with you know the exchange rate and and overall inflation but almost always in these circumstances what you see uh is that that uh that that the central banks do too little for too long on to get things going
What Are Economic Surveys Good For?,2024-04-21 12:15:02+00:00,1,iTZRg-3jlm8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTZRg-3jlm8,and then the last thing i'd say is there's a whole set of issues related to to surveys which um i think we're best off recognizing we don't fully understand why surveys have deteriorated in quality relative to where how good they were prior to the financial crisis and so i just wouldn't run out and say well a survey says it's bad they're great indicators because they tell you what everyone else thinks right they're not indicators for telling you what is happening and so that's part of the process of you know remember you your sec your your one two combo and understanding macro and using it to predict markets part of that discussion is understanding what everyone thinks and what's ultimately absolutely right
What Happens in Housing Market Cycles?,2024-04-20 12:15:08+00:00,4,tAw8-27BfkA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAw8-27BfkA,what we're probably going to see over time is that that you know those those sort of market dynamics over the course of years eventually a more fair market price gets established because there's some people who have to sell their houses or there's new builds that essentially have to get sold and there's some people who for whatever reason are buying houses and slowly but surely there will be a move towards um and a a a finding of the true value of housing um and in that context you know over time um the the new supply of housing will moderate because it'll become less and less attractive to to build new houses and sell them as the price goes down but that whole cycle i should i should say one more thing it's important to recognize that where that settles is very different than the crazy charts that you see around mortgage payments and which give the suggestion that prices are going to fall 50% because the marginal you know 9010 ltv borrower has to pay twice as much in a mortgage payment that's not how this settles what happens is the mar the people who are the marginal buyers and sellers at the peak start to change a lot and so the people who end up becoming the marginal buyers at the bottom are people with much stronger balance sheets much more cash cash oriented investors maybe not literally cash buyers but you know instead of taking a 9010 ltv loan they're going to take a 50 ltb loan or something like that to buy a house and so where it settles is not where that lever borrower would buy it's where it's where that um that better balance sheet buyer comes into the market and buys and so we're probably going to see something that's not down 50% no way it's going to be down 50% maybe it's down 25% something like that um and and and over time you're going to see a situation where you know building is going to reduce because selling houses at down 25% is less good than selling houses at the peak uh but that whole thing is is so slow it is it is unbelievably slow how long that whole dynamic takes um i i had a a tweet a while ago which talked about um which talked about when you know the the the timing of the nahb and when in the in the in the previous cycle the the housing bus cycle when you finally saw you know you you finally saw meaningful um declines in construction employment etc and those sorts of things take something you know in that cycle to be clear in that cycle which was the greatest housing bust in hundred years it took like two years plus for that all to flow through three years almost three years for all that to flow through from the peak to actually starting to get very weak employment in the construction sector and so two years in the construction sector three years in the overall economy and so what what you see and and this cycle is not anywhere near as bad as that because we don't have the leverage we don't have you know the foreclosure we don't have the force selling we don't have any of that and so housing is going to be a drag but it's going to be a boring drag um through time uh you know and not sufficient on its own to uh to end an economic expansion that's you know so driven by very strong nominal income r
Systemization Approach Challenges and Enhances Intuition,2024-04-19 12:15:04+00:00,4,lOcv7DKrscw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOcv7DKrscw,the process the process of developing a systematic approach to managing money is um in a lot of ways you what you do is you use systemization to help create leverage so instead of coming in every day and saying well the yen's you know ppp is this and the interest rate differential is this and the the you know instead of having to like recalculate that in your mind every day which is stupid because like computers are pretty good at that um and what you could do is you just take that data in process it based upon your you know by and large your existing understanding and and start with something that is a pretty good representation of how you would think about what's going on in the world and then i think the main thing that uh that and that creates there's all sorts of reasons why you want to do that because it creates discipline and it removes the emotion and you're not getting hung up on the news of the day and all those things all those things that are frankly like intellectual um there there are problems of human nature that can be that need to be resolved through discipline and systemization is an effective discipline right that's it's most most it is leveraging and disciplined and those are the two most effective things that it does but necessarily there's always things the world is evolving your understanding is evolving your thinking is evolving so there's always things that are incremental that could get better in that understanding over time and that's really what that process is which is you see what's going on in the world you see how you how you think things are playing out then you see how they are playing out and then you're constantly going back and forth and observing things you may have missed you may not have understood you know things like that and that generates questions and from questions become you know ideas of what are the other decision rules that should be used and from other decision rules that being used presuming you know they're good which to be clear the vast majority of people's intuitions are bad they're not good just just so that people have that understanding particularly if you rigorously assess it it is bad like 80% is bad like if you have a 200 or 300 hit rate on incremental ideas of how to trade markets that are good like you're a world-class investor just to have that in your mind and so that's what that process is and the and the observations and the writing of the stuff in a lot of ways is just talk about the discipline of trading it's also the discipline of wrestling with whether the views make sense or not that's what the writing is right is that discipline of saying i am actually going to sit here and i'm going to look at that stat and i'm going to look at what i think is going on and i'm going to compare those two things i'm g to say in line with what i think out of line with what i think incremental insight or understanding about and that's a lot of what you see me do on twitter like in some ways it's it's like a little boring which is like you know university of michigan confidence survey comes out i think it should look like transitory goldilocks okay what does it say well it ticked up in the essentially the growth part of it ticked up and the the inflation part of it ticked down okay check consistent with my understanding put it aside move on right that that's what the process really is all about
What's The Key To Conflicting Economic  Data?,2024-04-18 12:15:02+00:00,4,N0cDH2JdtWg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0cDH2JdtWg,and regarding the data there has been a lot of talk um on twitter and and other places i've read for regarding inconsistencies in the data um well we know about the philly fed numbers being off um and then the nfp the establishment versus the household surveys how the multiple job holders are getting counted since they're appearing on more than one payroll they're getting counted uh more than once and they're maybe inflating those numbers um do you find any of that relevant or is that just noise to you well i think this is a this is a good um it's a good example of dealing with the uncertainties of macroeconomic data um and you know i've spent essentially a career looking at not just the data itself but understanding and appreciating what we call sort of the goodness of the data and i think there's many times in which what you get is you get a conflicting set of reads about what's going on for all sorts of good reasons in the sense of like there's sampling error there's issues with methodologies there's all sorts of things like that and i think the most important thing to do in those circumstances is to triangulate um and i think you know you can't just look at one data source because what you could you can always find one data source almost always uh find except maybe in the extreme booms and the depth of a depression you can basically always find something that will point to a positive or a negative um and that's you know so that's fine there's people out there in the market who point to things that are positive somewhat exclusively and people who point to things that are negative somewhat exclusively and my recommendation on these sorts of cases is to triangulate across different pieces of information in order to get a holistic understanding we get all sorts of different pieces of information ranging from various ism employment surveys all the way to you know the household survey to the establishment survey to you know initial claims and so there's a whole wide series of information there some of which is realer is what i like to describe it as so like often you'll find initial claims is realer in the sense of like they're actually people submitting actual applications of you know claims for unemployment that get added up by by county and and state and to the to the country as a whole so that's a bit realer than some of the survey information but really there's all this different information and so you're best off when you look at it to just sort of add it all up and kind of average the whole thing to say where does where when i look at all of that different data where does it net me out at
Develop Multiple Edges to Generate Durable Alpha,2024-04-17 12:15:00+00:00,5,7JvO9eEpk3M,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JvO9eEpk3M,how do you focus on generating alpha yeah i think it's it's a um it's a great question i think when you think about um me many people when they think about generating alpha they focus on how do i become a great trader to you know be able to call the next you know big change in fed policy or the next big cycle in um in equities or things like that and i think what i've seen over time is that um you know that is not that can generate reasonable returns at a point in time but it's also very susceptible to luck um and you know you can many people get those sorts of trades right you know because they got lucky rather than because they have skill i think the key thing to creating what i'd call is durable alpha so alpha that you can rely on over time is by creating edge or identifying edge an edge is not big edge no one has there's no dur durable big edge that's out in the world and the reason why there's no durable big edge out in the world is because if there was durable big edge the biggest most sophisticated asset managers in the world would go out there and arbit away and so instead what kind of edge exists is um the type of edge that exists in the world that's durable edge i should say i had a conversation with meb faber recently um it's in the podcast i did with him and we were sort of joking like people talk about how they have five ratios or something you know 5.0 sharp ratios and we and it's basically that doesn't exist 5.0 sharp ratios don't exist in the world anyone who tells you they exist is either fooling you or fooling themselves or trying to fool you or fool themselves and so instead the thing that can be durable is to try and get a little bit of edge right if you get a little bit of edge if you are um if you're able to on the margin predict you know the earning cycle a little bit better than the market or fed monetary policy a little or or monetary policy a little bit better than the market then what you do is you create all these little edges and the way that you generate durable alpha is by taking all of these little edges that you have and uh taking all of those things and putting them together in a diversified portfolio um where you're not over relying on getting one bet right or another bet right because the very best managers as an example incredible the very best managers in the world get any one macroeconomic bet right uh in a month 55 45 or 6040 right so if you think that you can get if you think you could do better than 5545 either you have to believe that you're the you one of the most talented and successful asset managers that ever lived or you're wrong like that that's that's the reality of the circumstance and so it's important to then say if that is the reality how do i put on a bunch of bets that are slightly in my favor all the time in a way that creates a diversified portfolio in a way that you know i'm flipping the coin the coin that's slightly weighted in my favor a bunch of times so that i get a little bit better on the upside than i do on the downside in order to get that edge uh you know in order to get that durable alpha through time and that's really what i found what i see as that's the thing that creates alpha or that's the that's the way in which you can create durable alpha is by doing that thing not taking big yo's on particular outcomes
European Inflation in Apr 2024,2024-04-16 12:30:01+00:00,2,10qUfvJ4QNU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10qUfvJ4QNU,you know when we look at much of the rest of the world particularly in europe um you know the story is the story is definitely different in europe uh and and somewhat meaningfully so um in the sense of we've seen a meaningful decline in in in the way that you know the us is looking at is experiencing pressure uh for higher inflation europe is has experienced a relatively significant decline over the course of the last uh year or so inflationary pressures we've had the most recent set of prints out of germany and other s showing inflation below expectations and basically overall european inflation's now you know within a a spitting distance of the ecb's mandate while inflation is moderated uh what we haven't seen is we haven't seen a meaningful deterioration uh in growth um and that i think is important because um central banks almost all central banks are guided significantly by inertia uh they'll be highly responsive in a moment where economic conditions are deteriorating rapidly but as long as economic conditions are relatively stable or improving the urgency to cut interest rates is likely not nearly as high as some market participants might think and so while we have a circumstance here where europe is clearly on a different trajectory than the us uh we still you know the the significant pace of interest rate cuts that are expected in europe are probably not going to materialize consistent with what's priced into markets given the fact that we're actually seeing a bit of economic uh acceleration
ECB's vs the Fed's Current Stance in Early 2Q 2024,2024-04-15 12:30:05+00:00,3,3bQ2OjyiLYk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bQ2OjyiLYk,i know you're looking at europe you're looking at japan um two different people are asking in two different versions both mark and ralph any chance other central banks go before or instead of the fed and importantly does it matter another great question yeah um well matters you you know the beautiful thing about uh about trading markets is you can you know you can bet on the other markets and uh and the money doesn't care whether you're betting on the ecb or the fed um so that's always something to to keep in mind when you're thinking about how do you build diversification um you know when i look at i i think probably the place that looks most interesting to me is um is what's going on with the ecb you know who has talked very hawkish but under the hood what you see is um there's a pretty big difference in terms of the inflationary picture in the us and in europe and i think um uh it was overshadowed by the fed situation last week the ecb uh the the quarterly wage numbers came out came out about 3.1 down considerably from where they've been running five to six% and if you um watch the lagard press conferences which you know i recommend at triple speed um if you're gonna if you're if you're gonna waste your time with that every central banker that's right that's right exactly speed that stuff up um it was kind of the primary sticking point if you go back to the last couple of meetings where they were like we're not so sure wages are a bit of a concern we want to see them come down and in order for us to feel comfortable we need to see them come down 3% is a bit a bit higher than what it was you know prior to covid but it's not 3% is fine they can deal with 3% wage growth in the economy and that's going to you know combined with the fact that we're likely to you know get soft enough readings on inflation that my guess is the ecb is going to be um faster moving than what we see uh with the fed um in terms of you know responding to the to the real economy dynamics the growth is also a little softer there yeah um and things like you know other elements like that that are not literally in their mandate but certainly influence what they're thinking
Commodities at Post Covid Highs,2024-04-14 12:30:21+00:00,2,_XqobESZwWw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XqobESZwWw,bob what about geopolitics how much of a factor here we've been watching commodi and energy continue to be the outperforming sectors well i think from a global perspective what we're seeing uh is to some extent geopolitics but i think more broadly the fact that the us or the us economy and the global economy is not nearly uh in as bad a shape as many folks had expected and as a result what we're seeing is we're seeing uh commodity prices push to postco highs and even their highs of the last 10 or 15 years on a diversified commodity basket that overall picture is particularly challenging if you're sitting in the seat of a central bank uh that's trying to shift towards easing when we see those underlying input price pressures uh creating an inflationary impulse ahead and so it's all intersecting between uh the strength of the global economy some concerns about the geopolitical landscape flowing through to things like oil and the need or the the concern from global central banks that uh an easing cycle may be premature
Uncertainty Persists About China While Japan Stays Consistent,2024-04-13 12:15:04+00:00,4,dBiKClC__jg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBiKClC__jg,so what's your got feeling on what's ongoing in china right here it seems very tricky to gaug uh as far as i am uh able to um to to assess it from from the outside but what's your take yeah i i think it i i i share with you the um let's say the uncertainty about exactly what's going on i think when i look at most of the data and most of the market action it looks like not much has changed like you know i don't know the pmis are basically flat like trade you know was a lot weaker last year and you know is kind of neutral this year in terms of the numbers that we're seeing um the commodities that have the most china sensitivity things like steel and iron ore are basically plunging to you know postco lows uh and lows of almost the last 10 years so you sort of add that all up and you and and i should say also chinese bond yields continue to fall meaningfully if you look at that sort of constellation of things you' sort of say this doesn't really look like much is going on combined with the fact that the equity market after that pop from the national team buying has mostly been flat right over the course of the last couple of weeks so all of those things when you read the tea leaves look like nothing's really happening nothing's really changing and you're not really getting china getting geared up in the commodity demand and then of course you look at copper and it's surging through the roof and you're like okay two to two totally different stories that are going on there now maybe those idiosyncratic things you know we were talking about a little little bit of that in terms of the idiosyncratic things on copper um but that's copper i think is more the outlier than it is consistent with lots of the other data points at least i'm seeing a tr i would tend to agree with that um but it's very very tricky to figure it out um on a running basis also given the lack of transparency from uh from the chinese authorities but final question i have for you uh relates to japan uh they obviously moved the needle on the front end of the yield curve um and i guess it was the talk of the town a couple of weeks but nothing major happened right i mean where does the japanese outlook leave us from here in a global fixed income context i mean is it meaningful what is happening out there i i mean i think the boj uh it's been you know i've been following the boj for you know 20 years and uh i think you know their interest rate policy has been uh uh essentially zero for 20 years and tiny tweaks like what happened with the most recent announcement while it sort of like makes good twitter clickbait headlines of they're out of zero you know negative interest rates like it has essentially no functional impact on on uh on markets or or the economy i mean basically what's happening in japan is you know money is very easy the economy you inflationary pressures are very contained most inflation that's occurring basically all of it is from imported inflation on that um and the economy is you know puttering along it's fine it's not great and so that's a that's a sort of um set of conditions that would require continued easy monetary policy there's no reason to tighten rapidly and that's in the context of you know particularly in the us situation where you know you'd the overall set of conditions are strong and uh and for economic conditions inflation is starting to tick up and if anything you know pushing to tighter than expected monetary policy and so i think that divergence there it's not really going to be driven by what's going on in japan nothing is going to happen meaningful it's going to happen in japan you know as far as the i can see and so really like if you're trading the the currency let's say it's mostly going to be a function of what goes on with us monetary policy and dynamics much more so than it is whatever the vj is going to do
Is Money Tight?,2024-04-12 12:15:02+00:00,3,ShM1tnUj6FI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShM1tnUj6FI,do you try and assess this asa on a running basis or how do you view this long-term neutral rate concept from a tradable perspective yeah well i i think um i think it's more efficient rstar like who the heck knows put seven economists in a room get seven highly uh optimized econometric models that are now saying something totally different like who the heck knows you know um so i think rstar itself is not that interesting other than to say i think on the short end there's a lot better sens as to what's going on in in the sense of you can you can understand whether money is tight or easy by what's going on with economic conditions and economic you know we've had interest rates on the short end and the long end basically at this level for the last 18 months give or take and the economy has had seven quarters of at or above potential growth okay that answers your question your basic question is are interest rates you know is this a roughly neutral interest rate or is this you know a incredibly tight interest rate and i think you'd get those empirical outcomes if it was actually an incredibly tight interest rate so i think that empiric approach i think is the main way that you can understand whether money is tight or not and then of course you start to think about it incrementally from there and in particular i think start to think about what the term premium is and that term premium uh you know today is basically where it's been on average in the post gfc period which is about zero and you can start to ask yourself well do the macro the structural macroeconomic conditions do they align with a term premium uh that is consistent with what we've seen in the post gfc deleveraging or have the macroeconomic dynamics changed you know higher inflation pressures better productivity better im you know better population growth uh more structural you know um demand for capital relative to supply like all of those things point you in the direction of the fact that we should have a bit higher term premium than where we had before for but yet you know it hasn't yet moved because we've had those long only asset managers keep bidding every time you get an incrementally higher rate
Unlimited Macroeconomic Webinar April 2024,2024-04-11 12:15:02+00:00,56,V_Lg1d8-Yf4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Lg1d8-Yf4,[music] at the core of what i wanted to discuss this month for the macro webinar is this basic question of whether we can have strong growth elevated inflation and the fed continuing to cut interest rates and um the reason why i rais that is if you take a look at what the fed's projections were as part of the march scp what you see is that uh the fed penciled out this exact scenario strong growth elevated inflation above their mandate and a situation where they're cutting three times and while coming into the year i think there was uh a lot more bearishness in terms of the consensus expectations for the economy uh as well as expectations of you know softer inflation not too soft but somewhat softer inflation and far more cuts uh the world has really shifted over the course of the last three months uh in line with uh some of the themes that we had talked about a few months ago to kickoff of the year uh and now we basically have a picture where the consensus expectations uh are largely aligning with what the fed's expectations are and the market pricing is aligning with that we now have a situation in terms of what's priced into markets in expectations is growth that's going to average you know roughly 2.2% this year um now what that means is that we're probably seeing around that level of growth for the first quarter so we're expecting to see the strength of growth that we've seen in this quarter continue for the remainder of the year in addition expectations of inflation have risen considerably in part due to the fact that oil prices uh have risen over the course of the last few months and now expectations are for cpi in 2024 consensus expectations are almost 3% up from you know the low to mid tws and finally the market has moved reflecting the strength in economic conditions uh and that those rising inflationary pressures is now after pricing in far more cuts than what the fed expected to start off the year that gap has closed in addition as part of that pricing in stronger economic conditions uh we see that equities you know have pushed to new highs and so there's very much across the fed and the markets and you know market participants this consensus that we're going to get uh this combination of events that in many ways is pretty implausible to have such strong growth elevated inflation and continue to have roughly two to three cuts over the course of the year let's get into what's been driving uh the overall market let's start just very simply with what's going on with growth and inflation because anytime you're thinking about an economy that's really where the starting point is um despite the fact that many economists and market participants particularly those buying bonds down at 38 thought that the us economy was likely to slow considerably at to kick off 2024 uh largely economic data that is come in highlights the fact that the us economy uh has been pretty strong and there's a good reason why it's been uh pretty strong despite the fact of sort of the longer tale impact of continued tighter monetary policy we had what was the greatest financial easing in the course of in 40 years over the course of the last couple of months of 2023 and what that translated to very directly was supporting overall economic conditions spending demand to savings and keeping the expansion the pace of expansion that we saw in the second half of 23 flowing through here to 24 uh overall you put all the numbers together uh you know the the gdp now measure is somewhere between two and 3% um that's in the probably in the ballpark of what's reasonable um so definitely an economy that is at least today growing pretty strongly and as i said expectations have shifted sufficiently so that now the consensus is that that's how strong the economy is going to grow for the rest of the year i'd say matching that is pairing it with what has happened recently when it comes to inflation you remember what happened back at the beginning of the year the first meeting of the year chairman powell highlighted the fact that the committee needed more confidence in order to start a cutting cycle when it came to inflation since that point all the information that has come out has given has not given the committee any confidence right much less confidence uh than uh where they would have been standing at the first meeting of the year uh pce inflation has been reported above uh what the fed's mandate is and above expectations cpi inflation has and probably even more importantly the rise in oil prices and the likely blow through to gas prices of about a buck a gallon is sufficient enough to create an upward pressure on inflation that that didn't exist previously at the start of the year so we're having stronger growth and stronger inflation conditions uh both of which are not providing the fed the confidence they need in order to shift to an easing cycle uh it's important to recognize that a big part of why this is happening continues to that we continue to have the strength in economic conditions is because we continue to have an income financed expansion now that type of expansion income finan expansion is very different than many of the expansions that we experienced uh you know during our professional careers many of us experienced during our professional careers if you go back to you know the' 08 period we had a significant credit uh driven expansion right so significant increases in borrowing translating into rising asset prices and rising spending uh the limits of which were eventually hit which we created a reversal income driven expansions are totally different because income driven expansions uh are by their nature sustainable to the extent that a person earns income and then takes that income and spends it one person's in spending is another person's income and that income growth doesn't leave the wake of debt the way credit growth uh leaves a credit driven expansion and so balance sheets you know the expansion of economic conditions here financed by that income growth are expanding you know are improving balance sheets because incomes are rising without the detrimental effects that typically exist in a credit driven expansion on top of it uh what we're seeing is we're not really seeing a money driven expansion either so much of the expansionary power that existed in the post gfc period required the fed to pour money into the economy in order to keep the expansion going and when that money started to slow or reverse what we saw is economic undulations that tracked money creation if we look at what's been going on with money creation uh over the course you know or the fed balance sheet over the course of the last couple years you know that's contracting at the same time in which we're seeing continued economic expansion and so what that highlights is that this expansion is not not nearly is driven by money creation as those previous cycles and so in many ways what we have as a function of what's going on with income growth is uh is in many ways a more oldtime style expansion much different from the expansions of our career so what you see at this point is that nominal income growth uh wage growth which is what fuels the spending it hasn't changed that much it hasn't been that sensitive to the rise in interest rates so we've had interest rates roughly at these levels for about a year year and a half and nonetheless we see nominal income growth continue to expand a big part of the reason why that is is that labor markets continue to be tight enough to continue to put upward pressure on wages and have that grow in the context of the previous inflation and so what you see on the leand side is average hourly earnings a lot of people will focus on the little wiggles but like look at the picture it basically hasn't changed for a couple couple years and it remains above the levels in the pre-co period and on the right hand side from the personal income and spending report we have compensation of employees wage you know wage and salary dispersements which is probably the most direct you know instead of uh something like disposable income which has got a lot of different stuff in it this is probably the most direct read on what the money is that's going into people's pockets and you can see relative to the pre-co average uh you see that that's up about a couple of percent and so so we have stronger nominal wage growth than what we had in the pre-co period we don't have much in the way of debt growth very different from what we saw in the previous cycles so on the left hand side you see business credit expansion and here you see you know whether it's the 2000 cycle that created you know that was part of the bubble you know a lot of people talk about the the asset bubble that happened there a big part of what drove economic expansion in the late 90s was actually an investment bubble fueled by borrowing that's not happening today so whereas we saw that increase in borrowing in in the 2000 cycle in the 2008 cycle and the late uh post gfc cycle uh the overall debt burdens of corporations and incremental borrowing remains very low and then similarly from a housing from a household perspective you know household increases in debt that we saw say in the late 80s expansion uh a little bit in the late in the 2000 expansion and really accelerated in the 2008 expansion that's not happening this time either so borrowing by households uh continues to to be relatively soft um and so that expansion is happening because of income not because of credit very different so when you scan across uh what's going on across the economy it's probably one of the most interesting periods in many years where if you see in the if you look in that upper lehand chart it's one of the rare circumstances where what we're seeing is we're seeing uh the word slack here just means the level of economic activity continues to be elevated at a time when the borrowing in the economy the blue line is relatively soft and that is the effect the power of income growth you see that at the different sector levels um a big part if you look at the lower left-hand chart you can uh dissect what is actually financing household spending growth and what you see there in that right hand sorry that leftand chart the green and the blue chart that essenti all the spending that's happening right now is a function is being financed by income growth this is a very durable set of spending that can occur in the economy um it's been exacerbated or uh further enhanced by the fact that asset prices continue to rise uh considerably uh which is giving which is improving household balance sheets across all income cohorts whether it's the below uh uh you know the below median or above median um we're seeing improvements in balance sheets everywhere and we're seeing net worths and uh continue to push to new highs and i think that's one of the things when people look at the savings rate they'll say well look the savings rate is down a lot people are dissaving and what i'd say to that is in an environment where asset prices continue to push to new highs the need for savings is much lower if every every day you see your 401k go up the value of the home go up which you know two-thirds of americans own their home many of which is lever you know many of which hold their homes significantly levered you see your stock portfolio going up when you see all of those things happening the urgency to save particularly in environment where you're seeing uh elevated prices uh goes down and this isn't abnormal the level of savings rate that we're seeing today is actually very similar to the level of the savings rate we saw in the late 2000 period and it's actually a little bit higher than what we saw in that housing bubble period so this is a very common consequence of asset prices and i think it's one of the ways in which uh when people talk about you know how do asset prices affect the real economy this is an important linkage in terms of how that happens which is to the extent that you have elevated asset prices you have lower savings to the extent that you have lower savings you have more spending and so there is a connection pretty directly between what's happening in asset prices and what's happening in spending so the the the underlying income strength income growth strength is being is leading to even more even better spending in the economy because asset prices continue to rise a lot of folks have talked about uh the fiscal side of things uh being the primary driver of spending uh and growth in the economy and while fiscal expansion was a critically important part of creating a rebound in the economy post uh covid particularly in the 20 and 21 period what we've seen in terms of the fiscal balance is we've actually seen fiscal balance come in considerably from that big stimulus moment and uh instead what we've seen is that the income growth has picked up uh the slack essentially has carried economy for despite the fact that we've had some fiscal contraction relative to where we were before and so what i highlight here on the left hand side and and and and have done sort of a pretty extensive exploration of is two basic lines these are on the same axis side size so that you can get a sensus to the magnitudes of the two and what you see there is in the blue line which is nominal gdp and the dark the light blue line and the dark blue line is the size of the deficit uh and what you can see here is that the spike in the deficit you know size of the deficit times negative 1 the size in the deficit expansion that happened in 20 and early 2021 was critically important in creating a rebound in the economy but since that point since january 2021 what you see is that gdp nominal gdp is up $6 trillion do whereas the fiscal uh the fiscal situation the fiscal dynamics have actually contracted from that point so there's something else going on it's not just the fiscal expansion or the deficits that are driving things because if anything the incremental money being put into the economy from the federal government running deficit has actually slowed not increased so what could explain it well it must be something else it's not credit it's not fiscal it's income an incom driven expansion on the right hand side what you see here is uh an attempt an assessment basically to say you know gdp as a whole has moved up about $6 trillion dollar from preco to today on an annual basis how big if we were to take relatively extreme multipliers and flow those through how big would that have been in terms of um an impact on overall gdp growth and the answer there uh is even in using relatively extreme multipliers maybe you could make the case that about 25% of the incremental economic growth that has occurred has been driven by the fiscal expansion which of course leaves you know with essentially zero credit growth that leaves the vast majority driven by something else i think a lot of people i'll answer this in line because i was expecting this question to to come up uh nikki's question here on whether the government deficit um uh is the government the government deficit is annual uh and isn't compounded whereas gdp is what i'd say is think about gdp gdp is just the spending in a year in the same way the fiscal balance is just the transfer of money into the economy into the private sector from the public sector to the private sector in any one year those two things are annual flow annual sets of demand so that gdp number 26 or 28 trillion is how much total spending there is in an economy in a year and that $2 trillion doll deficit number that's how much the federal government is taking from the public you know is transferring to the private sector from the public sector in a given year and so often people will conflate and they'll say well what's happened is we've had this many accumulated this much accumulated deficit and that accumulated deficit looks something like how gdp has risen and that is conflating two critical it's complaining the concept of a a stock and a flow uh and what i mean by that is at a most basic level you can think about the fiscal deficit in the simplest level is just a transfer payment for spending let's just say that's all there is in a fiscal situation it's just a transfer payment for spending if that transfer payment let's just say in year one is a $100 and someone spends it the level that spends that $100 the level of gdp that will occur in year one is a $100 if the deficit expands the level of the sorry level of gdp is $100 if in year two if the deficit remains $100 and that transfer payment happens to someone right that level of spending will still be $100 a year too or the gdp growth that occurs the gdp growth that occurs is zero in that circumstance because each year you're getting the same in the same level of spending so the level of the fiscal deficit a consistent level of fiscal deficit is a consistent level of gdp support it's not cumulative in that way and so as a result you don't want to think about it as a compounded effect fiscal deficits are a compounded effect you want to think about them uh as a as an incremental flow and if why when it comes to all debts in order for debt accumulation to create continued growth you have to have either borrowing pickup or def deficits pick up they have to get bigger and bigger each year in order to generate growth because if they're just the same even if they're large even if they're very large if they're the same level of deficit it's the same support to the level of incomes and the same support to the level of spending so that's of course always classically one of the challenges china is learning this challenge uh themselves which is that you have to have accelerating rates of credit creation in order to maintain the same rate of gdp growth on an ongoing basis so it's not really the fiscal uh you know the fiscal is certainly a help it's certainly not a hindrance relative to where we were in early 2019 but it's certainly not the big story and increasingly what we're seeing is this durable income growth environment the challenge with that is that nominal income growth and nominal spending is too high relative to the productive capacity in the economy and as a result we're seeing inflation and so over a short period of time you know through the end of last year we saw uh to some extent a moderation in inflation and measured inflation numbers a big part of that a big support to that story was two uh two things one was that oil prices gas prices went from $4 a gallon down to $3 a gallon that has essentially fully reversed by this point uh particularly with you know today's market action number two is we've seen a moderation you know a shift in a start to fall in in a number of different durable goods the price level of which was relatively elevated created an inflationary pressure before and the fact that uh those prices started to fall that was uh helped uh bring down inflation and the more structural dynamics that we we saw on inflation which is the core services uh numbers you know those really haven't moved all that much um over the course of the last uh couple of months and so we basically have this inflation conundrum problem here which is that we have a dynamic where the core servic as part of the economy which is tied to wages relative to productivity continues to grow in a way that is creating an underlying structural inflationary pressure that's too high for the fed the support the disinflationary support which was seen in core goods prices has started to moderate and a big reason why that is is in order for inflation inflation remember is a rate of change concept in order for inflation to uh continue to be at the current rate of inflation if something is uh falling in price it has to keep falling in price uh in the same way month after month and what we're seeing with core goods prices is we're starting to see the price falls flatten out toward zero and that disinflationary force abating which is causing overall inflation to measured inflation to start to rise and then the right hand side what i'm highlighting is a huge shift probably the most important shift the most important chart that uh that is is affecting uh the macroeconomy and will affect monetary policies this one on the right which highlights the fact that uh the fed pivot which we saw emerge in november and december and be reh highlighted again in the early part of the year was highly dependent on the fact that oil prices were falling oil prices not only have stopped falling moderating the disinflationary force but they have risen and we are back to a level traded gasoline prices that were consistent with $4 oil $4 gas i should say a gallon gas which is where we were when inflation concerns were emerging across uh from the fed and so that is an a critically important dynamic that's going on and that when you think about confidence and concerns about the whether inflation is beat that's going to be a real concern for the fed and that's going to take some time to flow through to the measured data and reported data more generally if you just think about where we are from an asset price perspective i think you know a lot of folks are are in from from a from a bond market perspective are looking at what's going on right now and essentially thinking we're we're basically going back to a post gfc state right so when you look at the term premium that's demanded in bonds it's essentially zero consistent with the average that we've seen in the post gf fc period look there's a lot of different ways to calculate this you don't have to get too hung up on it it's pretty clear the term premium that you get from holding uh long dated bonds today is quite a bit lower than what it was you know back in the earlier 2000s or in the 90s you know is it zero is it negative is it slightly positive it doesn't really matter the relative is what matters so we're seeing expectations of depressed term premiums the reason why those term premiums would be depressed is because um because folks uh because there's a lot more demand to save relative to borrow in the economy and because there's an expectation of running significantly easy monetary policy and compress risk premiums for an extended period of time and if we're an environment where the economy continues to expand and where we have inflationary pressures there's no reason to believe that we'll have the type of long-term disinflationary forces in place that we had over the course of the post gfc period the right hand side i think probably one of the more interesting dynamics also is what's going on with with people's expectations of long-term interest rats for most of the post gfc period you know basically everyone agreed that the neutral rate was two and a half uh give or take uh the long-term neutral rate and in fact chairman powell in a press conference when uh short-term rates moved above two and a half percent said that monetary policy was tight as a function of that you know i think the empirics would suggest that that was not a reality um and he you know eventually withdrew that basic uh premise but when you go and you look at who is buying bonds today those sort of long only uh asset managers that are extending duration they're looking at yields like 440 or 430 and they're saying this is a great yield because the long-term neutral rate of interest is two and a half so i'm getting you know a couple hundred basis points above the long-term neutral rate of interest and that's the case that's good value but it's not clear that that is actually consistent with the reality of what the long-term neutral rate of interest will be a lot of the dynamics that created a depressed uh set of circumstances for long-term interest rates post gfc have basically reversed uh let's start with something simple like the global supply and demand of capital you know much of the post gfc period uh was uh formed and and affected by the fact that there were large surpluses run by uh asian central banks who used that capital and recycled it back into the us economy a savings glut in many ways which helped depress their currency and created a demand for us assets that's gone uh there there was a uh significant debt deleveraging that was occurring over the course of that period you know that debt deleveraging was a was a meaningful drag on interest rates because debts were too high relative to incomes and balance sheets had to get restructured well there's been a significant restructuring of household and business balance sheets to the effect that they don't necessarily uh are aren't in a position where they have to be paying down debt nearly as much so what that's allowing them to do you know that creates a capacity to borrow and then on top of it we're seeing is a significant shift to increasing investment in the economy relative to where were the post gfc period in part it's driven by the housing market which was depressed for an extended period of time and it's now picking up after almost a decade of underweight underdone supply in the market and then also what we're seeing as a function of the global uh the the global forces related to um de globalization is that it's going to take a lot of investment to create parallel supply chains uh whether it's you know uh friendly supply or uh domestic supply you know all of that takes investment we've seen a construction boom in non-residential uh investment as well all of which is sucking up capital taking on capital in order to uh further create a a circumstance we have uh you know continued demand for capital much higher demand for capital than we've seen in many years whereas the supply of capital has changed and then probably the most the the biggest structural thing is we were in a deflationary environment for years a deflationary environment where the question was the worry was are we going to have you know are we going to fall into a deflationary trap like japan and instead the dynamics today are very different from that the question today is you know is inflation going to run hot relative to the fed's mandate for an extended period of time you put all those things together and while it's uncertain exactly what the interest rate is it sure doesn't look like the neutral rate of interest is the same today as it was in the post gfc period and just take all of those long only bond managers who quickly quote basically every time quote on the financial media that uh that you know long-term interest rates are two and a half percent and that's where we're going what if they change their tun and say that it's three or three and a half or four that would radically change what uh how how good uh bonds look at current yields and so we're not really normal on either front which creates the risk both tactically and more structurally around rising rs and so i think it's important to say okay so we have these basic dynamics how is this going to play out what i'd emphasize here is you want we we've talked about uh about sticking to the order sticking to the linkages you know i've i've had this this uh this piece here this ordering on the right for you know for nine months now and it's held through which is it's important to recognize the dynamics which is we have a strong economy it's income finance it will continue until rates rise once rates rise that will put a pressure on uh valuations stocks will fall when stocks fall it will affect demand in the way that i described earlier it will reverse demand as asset prices fall once that demand slows earnings will decline once earnings decline the job market will weaken and when the job market weakens we have a self-reinforcing dynamic that occurs on the demand side and eventually that will get inflation durably to target but the important thing to recognize is that that set of you have to hold yourself accountable to that order because until we get enough of a rate rise uh in the market to start to create a hit to asset prices we're not going to get the turn in the cycle and so that's basically what we've seen in the first quarter is you know we've had a rate rise but not enough of a rate rise to create a turn in the economy and if we just look back to that period uh in the fall in the in the summer and fall last year you know we saw interest rates move to five we saw a 10% decline in stocks and during that time it wasn't sufficient to create a downturn in the economy now admittedly it was a relatively short period and it was met with a significant treasury and fed easing uh that occurred uh you know on november 1st but it does give you some insight into how high do rates really have to go in order to create a durable turn in the economy and at that time 5% rates took a 10% hit to stocks but today stocks are 10% higher than they were even at the beginning of that draw and so we're probably seeing a circumstance where you need to see you know maybe a 100 basis points more of long-term interest rate rise in order to really create a turn uh in this in this cycle a durable turn in the cycle otherwise um what what you're seeing is you're going to continue to see enough income growth enough demand growth it will continue uh to occur over time and i think probably one of the most important things when you're thinking about about this overall environment is to think about what is to hold yourself accountable to the order because it's so easy to say well eventually there will be a recession yes eventually there will be a recession but the issue is particularly when you're trading bonds is that first c traes have to rise that will kick off the cycle and then they will fall and so it's important to recognize that ordering and not get ahead of it the way so many have over the course of the last couple years let's um let's uh turn our attention to the rest of the world we talked a lot about the us uh and where we are in that cycle um and i think uh you know when we look at much of the rest of the world particularly in europe um you know the story is the story is definitely different in europe uh and and somewhat meaningfully so um in the sense of we've seen a meaningful decline in in in the way that you know the us is looking at is experiencing pressure uh for higher inflation europe is has experienced a relatively significant decline over the course of the last uh year or so inflationary pressures we've had the most recent set of prints out of germany and others showing inflation below expectations and basically overall european inflation's now you know within a spitting distance of the ecb's mandate while inflation is moderated uh what we haven't seen is we haven't seen a meaningful deterioration uh in growth um and that i think is important because um central banks almost all central banks are guided significantly by inertia uh they'll be highly responsive in a moment where economic conditions are deteriorating rapidly but as long as economic conditions are relatively stable or improving the urgency to cut interest rates is likely not nearly as high as some market participants might think and so while we have a circumstance here where europe is clearly on a different trajectory than the us uh we still uh you know the the significant pace of interest rate cuts that are expected in europe are probably not going to materialize consistent with what's priced into markets given the fact that we're actually seeing a bit of economic uh acceleration let's turn our attention to japan um japan uh you know for two years uh we've heard stories of how japan is radically is is on the path to radically change their monetary policy and that is not happening uh while japan i guess ended the zero interest rate policy it was more nor uh uh nominal in a sense that it was material or impactful and the reason why that is is that while you know there's some desire to get out of monetary policy that's been in place for the last you know 15 years and was designed during a period of significant deflationary risk there really is no urgency for the bank of japan to do anything um and they express his much that they will take a lot of caution in terms of of moving beyond the most recent policy change the reason why that is is that when you look at the underlying pressures on the japanese economy inflation's not really a thing uh after a brief spike uh last year core inflation is basically at their mandate or lower headline inflation is at their mandate or lower and basically all the inflation that they're experiencing can be attributed to import costs you put that together and also look at a wage growth number that you know there's a lot of headlines uh trying to make a case that japanese wages are surging you can see how they're doing they're not surging it you know you wouldn't be able to tell this this period from any other period really of the last 20 years uh and so there really is no urgency for the bank of japan to do much of anything and so most likely they're going to continue to run the easiest monetary policy in the developed world and what will more and not do much and what will more meaningfully drive things like the exchange rate will be uh the us side of uh the monet of monetary policy and interest rates not the japanese side finally i'll i'll i'll uh in terms of a a global scan i i'll leave it with china china um you know there's been four years where uh analyst in the west have talked about uh the coming chinese rebound and it has yet to materialize and the most recent flavor of this was you know came uh a few uh weeks ago when the national team started to intervene in uh the equity markets in order to prop up those markets and stop them from falling as rapidly as they had been what we've seen after a short pop a short initial pop uh over the course of the last you know five or six weeks uh nothing uh the equity market has stabilized and and has basically been flat so you know all that promise of uh a great equity rebound has yet to be fulfilled and i think there's a good reason why that is uh in the sense of the magnitude of the intervention that was needed just to create stability in that equity market was huge much much larger than previous intervention attempts and so and it's not clear that uh chinese authorities are really all that interested in creating an equity market rise rather than basically stopping an unruly decline that could create financial stability concerns and that's essentially what we're seeing is that you know the stock market doesn't continue to go up economic conditions in china have been mediocre for several years and they continue to be mediocre um a lot of folks here on the leth hand side you see the reported pmi number you know a lot of headlines that it was i don't know the highest in 18 months or something like take a look at the chart it hasn't changed in two year two or three years right there's no real change in that dynamic and those markets where chinese uh demand is a substantial portion of uh of of global demand like iron ore and steel and steel as you could see in those middle charts uh and the top section are pressing postco lows further we're also seeing the chinese bond market which you know is a is a reasonable indication of domestic economic conditions uh basically trading flat no indications over the course of the last couple of months that there's a growth acceleration happening in china the main outlier is in copper uh it looks like a pretty much an idiosyncratic story in terms of what's going on with a small handful of domestic speculators uh really creating a lot of uh bidding on copper in the short term in order to uh on the hope essentially that there's going to be recovery uh but doesn't look like it looks more like an outli than it does uh like a primary driver and we're back to the same old story in china us interest rates have risen pressure on the exchange rate has increased intervention attempts by the chinese have increased substantially in order to arrest a further decline in the currency fascinating to see the fact that the offshore yuan traded below the fix band highlighting the fact that there's a fair amount of speculative pressure that's going on in the economy on the currency and what that really does is it just limits it creates a tradeoff in the us context if economic condition conditions were depressed and um you know the federal reserve as well as fiscal authorities would ease in response to that and the currency would not be a meaningful driver meaningful constraint to their behaviors just think about you know post gfc that's essentially what happened uh large easing to support the economy and a decline in the exchange rate in the chinese context chinese authorities are prioritizing exchange rate stability above stimulating domestic demand and they consistently find themselves in this conundrum where they have this downward pressure on the currency and they basically don't want to ease further because easing further would add further pressure to the currency and so it's uh what do i say more of the same in china not much has changed uh and probably not much is going to change anytime soon as long as the us economy continues to push forward the last thing i wanted to talk about it's gotten a lot of attention in the markets is gold it actually ties nicely to the chinese story as well um gold uh continues to press the highs you're also seeing it in some of the domestic et there's a domestic etf gold etf that's trading 30% above spot so a lot of demand in asia for gold i you know i think sensibly connects to the exchange rate and frankly the fact that there aren't a lot of great ways if your uh domestic uh a domestic saber in china to protect yourself from stock draw downs and currency draw downs other than gold bitcoin's outlawed very very hard to move money in any substantial size uh across borders and it doesn't take much for uh much demand because the gold market is is you know in the scheme of global financial markets or chinese savings the gold market is tiny uh in that context and so it doesn't take much incremental demand not to mention the more structural demands from global central banks and others around what's going on so this isn't doesn't look at least at this point primarily a story of concerns about the dollar it looks much more like idiosyncratic concerns or concerns about asian currencies and and uh and saving uh savings there so i'll pause there uh and we can get through some audience questions uh thank you everyone uh you know uh we missed each other last week or last month and so felt like i had a lot more to talk about a lot more going on uh so i appreciate folks sticking around i'm gonna i'll i'll keep answering some questions here so uh uh but no hard feelings since we've reached the top of the hour if you want to if you want to jump off let me go through a few of the questions that were submitted in advance um i think the fir the first question here uh is around uh um uh can fed cuts be restrictive as companies with high cash balances will earn less uh just as they earned more as interest rates rose well i think that direct linkage is true that uh there are certainly a many sabers who hold large cash balances and the rise in interest rates has increased their incremental income but it's important to recognize the totality of the effect of rising interest rates or falling interest rates for that matter on the economy it goes well beyond the income effect and in fact for the us economy perspective probably the most influential story in terms of the impact of interest rates up or down on the economy is on asset prices you know like to joke that you know bonds are in the stocks but i think it's an an important thing to always keep in mind just as bonds are in the houses well as interest rates rise what that means is that the discount rate on all financial assets also rise rises and in an environment where you have a discount rate of on all financial assets rising that is a hit to asset prices and so while that there certainly is an income effect for a subset of borrowers or subset of investors that are getting more incremental income particularly on their cash it is vastly outweighed by the higher cost of credit leading to slower credit demand and the higher cost of the higher risk-free rate creating an ag hit to all financial assets which are critically important to keeping the economy going another question here um is uh now that po is thrown in the towel on 2% inflation shouldn't the us long bond decline i think it's a great question a critical question to be wrestling with um the first thing i'd say is it's certainly not it's not certain by any stretch that uh chairman po of the committee has given up on their mandate though there certainly are uh questions raised about it when you look at what the dot plot suggests that the fed will be comfortable with essentially five total years of inflation being meaningfully above their targets so that i think it's reasonable to start to ask questions about whether they are essentially de facto allowing a higher inflation regime um but so far many investors are uh are sticking to this idea or at least believe this idea that the 2% inflation mandate will be met it's just taking a little while i i think it's important when you think about what's would transpire say the fed were to announce a 3% target whether bonds you'd expect bonds to go bond prices to go up or down most likely what would happen is bond prices would go down and the reason why that is is for two reasons one what that would mean is that the level of interest rates uh that would occur in the economy would likely be higher structurally because you know interest rates are a real interest rate inflation expectation and if inflation expectations shift from 2 to three that would more structurally that would create a higher structural uh expected uh inflation number in in the markets and so uh in terms of break even inflation that would likely go up which would lead to bond yields rising or bond prices going down but probably more important is the term premium which has been so critical to keeping bond yields contained would likely go up substantially and the reason why that is is once we transition from a world where there's relative certainty that we're going to maintain the purchasing power of money or at least you know generally maintain the purchasing power of money to one in which the fed is being flexible particularly in a higher inflationary environment uh to go to you know to go to 3% it raises the question of whether 4% or 5% or 6% is in the cards i'm not saying that they're going to do that i'm just saying if you think about the linkages once you open the door to a higher inflation targeting regime what that does for the b for a bond investor is it start to raise the question about how much risk premium how much term premium am i going to have to accept in that environment and the rise in term premiums that would inevitably occur with a 3% or higher mandate announcement would would likely substantially influence would you know would be substantial um and would create sort of an unmoral target would lead to shorter term monetary policy uh easier monetary policy it almost certainly would lead to higher long-end interest rates and a downdraft in assets um let's see if we hit uh one or two more things um there's a question here about a credit event and and particularly in the banks uh in an environment of rising interest rates i think it's a it's a very interesting question you know part of the concern uh that we've seen in the banks is related to the interest you know to the sub to the substantial securities buying that many banks did uh during the period of low interest rates and as interest rates rise the value of those securities have gone down and of course svb happened and and intervention subsequently with btfp which is now rolled off and so i think it's an interesting question you know part of the question when you look at the overall macroeconomy dynamics you'd say you know what it looks like is that there's likely pressure upward pressure on interest rates uh ahead of us and just how much can the economy how much interest rate rise can the economy stand uh you know without something happening i think it's it's pretty interesting to see that when you look at the banking the banking institutions when you look at banks after a relatively acute moment uh of funding stress that occurred around v we we've actually seen uh an improvement in conditions even during this period where interest rates have gone up 60 basis points in the course of three or four months deposit accumulation is starting to rise both in small and large banks nims are stabilizing at levels above when the fed was tightening uh small banks are actually starting to expand their balance sheet uh by lending by picking up their lending i think that's really important because if a small bank if a bank was being stressed on the funding side of things um you wouldn't have a circumstance where they would be expanding their balance sheet and lending more and so they've been able to stabilize their overall balance sheet uh relatively well i think in part through the fact that some securities uh were sold at some point but also i'd say in part because um you know regulators got in there and cleaned up and forced the clean up of a lot of the mess uh that those banks had in had in place and for them to reduce their you know their overall interest rate sensitivity through a variety of different measures and so when you look at for instance at how you know k is is uh is doesn't look particularly influenced by the rise recent rise in bond yields and so that area of the market that looked like it was going to be the big driver of a lot of bank problems you know at this point a year looking back mostly looks like the sensitivity of the banking system which is really the most leveraged part of the system uh is pretty low uh to rise in interest rates at this point so you know we went to 5% rates and not much happened uh in the banking system and i'd expect more of the same with higher rates let's turn our attention to some of the questions asked while uh we were here a couple questions about um you know what level uh do rates have to rise in order to start impacting stock prices or what's enough of a rate rise to create a turn um to be clear like i i think the level of interest rates we went through a period of time where um interest rates were low at the start of the year interest rates were relatively low you know in the 380 range uh and expectations of growth were relatively low over the course of the last three months we basically reset that dynamic considerably expectations of growth are high and interest rates at the same time have started to rise reflecting the fact that and stocks have risen uh reflecting the fact that the economy is stronger than what was expected in the beginning of the year we're basically you know what i'd say is it looks like we're getting close to that point in which uh in which we'll see an environment where uh where further rises in bond yeld we're sort of right at that cusp where further rises and bond yields are likely to start to take uh start to make an impact on stock prices now that's separate i'd separate that point just because further rises and bond yields are starting to create a drag on equity prices doesn't mean that that drag on equity prices is enough to create a drag on the economy to create a turn in the market in turn in the in the macroeconomy that's where i'd emphasized that you can't just have you know some stabilization of of stocks some leveling out of stocks as bond yield rise or some weakness in stocks you have to have enough weakness in stocks in order to start to create shifts in demand shifts for long enough in order to start her earnings and kick off the cycle downward and so i think what's really interesting there is that um you know we probably need bond yields almost 100 basis points higher to create enough of an equity market decline to start to create the downturn in the real economy otherwise we could have a situation where stocks model through growth is a bit weaker than what people expect bond yields have a modest upward pressure but we don't do enough to create the full down cycle in the economy more like a moderate slowing rather than a fullterm um we've got a couple other questions here i'm just scanning through uh some of these things we already answered so i'm i'll uh you know uh we answered i answered in one form or another uh in um in uh this i'm just scanning through apologies uh bear with here if i see i think i'll um i think an interesting question here is uh you know will the us ever implement yield curve control in one form or another i'll probably end with this one um i think the ordering is super important when you're thinking about this because the reason why uh the federal reserve uh and the treasury and and and regulatory institutions would implement a yield curve control type point or dynamic or for that matter large scale purchases of treasuries is in an environment where the bond where economic conditions are weak and bond yields are not moving down fast enough relative to the deterioration in economic conditions and so it's important to recognize that dynamic requires a meaningful turn in the economic cycle and so folks who are out there saying hey look i'm going to buy bonds today because i know hey at some point the us is going to implement yield curve control and iz the debt are losing sight of the fact that we have to have a path to get to that point we have to have interest rates rise we have to have the economy turn before we get to the point where yields are too high relative to economic conditions where we'll then see that possible implementation so if the question is hey could the us ever implement you know particularly in a deflationary depression type environment a yield curve control approach absolutely they absolutely could and i would you know wouldn't be surprising to see that occur uh it is uh the type of tool and the toolkit that has existed many times in the past and i imagine will exist into the future but from a trading markets perspective in the near- term it doesn't look like it's a meaningful consideration that you'd want to have i think i'll leave it there thank you so much most of these other questions in one way or another uh we've answered through the course of the conversation um thank you everyone for for taking a few uh minutes out of your week and and bearing with me for a bit longer than normal webinar i really appreciate uh all the interest
Gold Prices Driven By Asia Demand,2024-04-10 12:15:03+00:00,3,hnyZgczuFdY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnyZgczuFdY,well i think it's it's very interesting that we've seen precious metals gold in particular push to new highs during a period of time where us rates are rising and expected cuts are being priced down that's typically not the way the relationship works because you know gold is nonin bearing money and typically when interest rates rise gold falls because it doesn't bear any interest i think um the story there is much more about what's happening in the east rather than what's happening in the west where downward pressure on uh on the yuan in particular is creating domestic demand for gold we're seeing um we're seeing significant uh demand sort of through proxy ways like uh domestic gold etfs trading at 30% premiums which is not a normal thing the shanghai premium uh relatively elevated all of those things are happening and i think that's what's driving the gold price action because when you look in the west actually like gld which is a good indication gld etf which is good indication of you know retail and institutional demand for gold because of it's easy it's an efficient way to hold it they're still selling shares there's still a net negative flow into gld at a time when the gold price is surging and so really is that story uh in the far east and about the currency policy and pressures that exist in china much more so than it is about what's going on with the fed so if we look at the domestic positioning in the us in precious metals how do you actually gauge the current positioning is it underweight precious metals given even with the price action that we've seen yeah i mean if you if i think the sentiment uh western investor sentiment i think is well tracked with that uh with looking at the flows into and out of the gld etf it's obviously doesn't cover the whole market and there's other things going on the futures positioning and things like that um but it's become sort of a ubiquitous way in which basically everyone expresses a view on gold in the us and so um i think what we're seeing there we've seen two years of sales of of gold positions in gld as gold prices have risen uh and i think you know that is setting up likely that's setting up a risk for a short squeeze i mean this is sort of a a very classic way in which uh these sort of short squeeze dynamics emerge which is you know you're underweight you're selling and then all of a sudden the price squeezes for some reason un related to you know the previous positioning and then even moving from selling to neutral in terms of the flows could create a further exacerbation of the price pressures upwards and so that's kind of the dynamic that i see emerging in the gold market is that sort of western short squeeze you know demand driven by china creating a western short squeeze which is starting to put pressure on you know further pressure on the price upward yeah
Will The Fed Still Cut Rates in 2024?,2024-04-09 12:15:06+00:00,2,o_iU9a_MzhY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_iU9a_MzhY,where does that leave these three cuts in the dot plot from the federal reserve uh i mean do you think they will actually cut into this i you know it's it's a good question i i think um when we started the year i the first thing i woke up january 1 and i and i wrote a tweet that was basically like look if growth is at or above potential and inflation is still a little too high and unemployment rates at secular lows like why would you do anything right and i think that the spirit of and that was a time when people thought that they were to cut like in march for the first cut and we've moved past that um you know the idea that uh the economic expansion is sort of good enough to not create urgency to cut plus i think some of those inflationary pressures um are maybe not long-term emerging but certainly cyclically we're likely you know in a in a short-term basis in the us context starting to see some upward pressure on inflation we've got a couple months of of but not good data not bad data but not uh adding confidence the way chairman powell was looking for and now we've got you know gas prices are moving up a buck from having fallen a buck and that you know that has an effect that'll flow through to other prices and so inflation is likely to be just a bit above what they were projecting out or expecting and so you put that together and i think we could easily see a circumstance where um at least you know for the next three or six months there's just nothing there's not enough confidence to shift towards the cut cycle um given you know the the overall uh economic environment so that's why i think if you get to the end of the year we may well have a situation where the short rate cuts expected don't come the long rate is moving up for a variety of reasons but growth is starting to slow because the effects of those dynamics right the rise in rates is starting to affect the economy and asset prices particularly relative to the elevated expectations
What's Driving the Economic Optimism?,2024-04-08 12:15:02+00:00,4,hMlt-zp_drc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMlt-zp_drc,the mood in the room right now it seems like everyone is all of the sudden so optimistic around the future what on earth is going on and what has happened over the past couple of quarters to make people turn around on their views like this yeah i mean i think what we've seen is that the durability of the expansion particularly in the us economic context but also to some extent in in europe has been um a bit stronger a bit longer than than folks expected there's a lot of positioning i think that came in you know on the back of the market action that happened uh at the at the end of last year where you know when you saw that bond rally i mean what typically drives a bond rally is uh deteriorating growth conditions and um the thing that's confusing about that you know so people expected you know many people expected that to continue and economists and other managers were sort of keying off that um but i think they got the linkage wrong which is that we had an easing dynamic which helped support asset prices which was a short-term support to economic activity creating a modest reacceleration but the problem is you know and that's why you know stocks have outperformed bonds over the course of the last you know three or four months but the problem is now the consensus expectations has totally changed we went from expectations of below 1% us growth in 2024 to now penciling out you know between two and two and a half% growth which is basically to say that that the strong growth we're seeing here in the first quarter is going to continue basically for the whole year at a time when basically bon yelds have risen 60 basis points that seems less probable uh than expected but bob if we look at consensus expectations outside of the us it still seems like this is a very us centric rebound story right um do you get the same vibes of reflation outside of the us yeah it's it's a good point and certainly the consensus expectations have lagging outside the us uh relative to the us i mean the us is really the outlier when it comes to expected increases in in growth um i you know the the um the economies outside the us i mean particularly if i look at sort of europe and and the uk they're not you know those economies certainly aren't strong and no one's arguing that but they're not a disaster and i think in a lot of ways people looked at those economies if you go back a year or two ago year ago like they thought that the interest rate tightening that occurred was going to drive a significant slowing in those economies and that's not really happening they're just kind of putting along kind of you know fine not great you know it's not it's it's it's nothing particularly extreme and i think that connects to the ecb story um which is that on the ecb side um and also a little bit on the bank of england side uh you know inflation has come down sufficiently basically where they can you know in a straight face way say we're basically at what our target is maybe you know or or we're going to see our target soon
U S  Economy –  Is a No Landing Scenario Priced into Markets?,2024-04-07 12:15:00+00:00,3,3YEaZt8KiOs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YEaZt8KiOs,i mean on the one hand you've got a lot of macro resilience showing up in the economic data including the jobs report this morning on the other commodities are moving higher crude has had a big move this week um we've seen the dollar strengthen into your point i mean you got the 10year treasury yield at 44 now highest since november seems like something's got to give here uh how does it speak to how this economic landing is materializing well i think what we're seeing get priced into the stock market uh and modities is we're starting to see a no landing scenario uh pretty much priced in at this point uh and the same is true increasingly on the short end as fed cuts start to get priced out the main place where that no landing scenario isn't priced is on the long end of the bond market which you know while it's pressing highs uh over the course of the last couple of months we're well off where we were uh last summer when bon yields hit five and even then you know we didn't have a meaningful slowdown in economic activity so i really think that long end uh is is the is the area of the market that is most meaningfully mispriced and that's coming at a time when we're getting a bunch of inflation data next week combined with almost $120 billion dollar of bond sales that flow that constant issuance financing those large deficits that constantly is going to weigh on the bond market particularly here in the second quarter okay um cash is that is that is that should that be a part of your portfolio right now and i ask that because bank of america report showed that $82 billion in the week through wednesday went into cash funds that money market funds are now annualizing 1.2 trillion dollars of inflows it's the second highest ever so clearly investors are putting at least some money to work there does it make sense in this environment well i think uh you know cash is never a great asset to have unless you can truly market time it's generally better to be invested in assets on a tactical basis with stocks where they are to where they are at this point and the pricing in of very very high uh growth expectations and bonds not looking great um you know cash can be an interesting alternative though you know when you think about what assets are out there and where um there may be interesting opportunities might look to the commodity space where we're starting to get uh conditions aligning for a bit of a short squeeze uh for those people holding large short positions in oil and then of course uh there's my favorite gold which uh you know keeps pushing higher
Energy Sector And China in April 2024,2024-04-06 12:15:05+00:00,3,rlDsD8bpQCA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlDsD8bpQCA,i know you like uh the energy sector as well bob big big sector of course where where specifically bob do you see value well i think broadly across the energy sector it's been the most unl loved stock sector uh over the course of the last you know 12 to 18 months uh particularly seeing asset managers uh building meaningful short positions for instance across the hedge fund industry and flows into the etfs related to the companies also basically the weakest sector that we've seen i think in a lot of ways the market action um is setting up for a possible short squeeze there as uh as there's so many short or underweight positions in place uh at a time when you know not really for economic reasons but uh for supply constraint reasons as well as geopolitical tensions we're starting to get a spike up uh another leg up here in oil and you put that together you could create that short squeeze and a positive performance for both the stocks and the commodities themselves interesting bob at at the same time i also want to get you to sort of play off of what bill was saying about china because i know you have a view on what's going on there currently maybe you could talk a little bit about how you think that's going to play into or not play into what's going on with energy well everyone here in the west is uh hoping for the great chinese recovery we've been hoping for several years and the reality is that it's just more of the same for whatever reason from a policy making uh perspective chinese authorities have decided that mediocre growth is more is is acceptable and are prioritizing exchange rate stability rather than engaging in domestic monetary easing that's necessary uh to support or accelerate the economy and so when you look across uh all the stats whether it's the pmis they've been flat for a couple years uh you look at the commodities that china meaningfully influences like or and steel uh and you're seeing those fall to you know postco lows um you know it's not a great picture for the chinese markets and that small equity pop that we saw took huge buying from the national team just to get a modest recovery and equities so i i look at china i sort of say lot more of the same and that hope uh that so many investors have brought that it would accelerate in the course of uh 2024 doesn't look like it's going to happen okay
2Q Repriced Expectations in U.S. Markets,2024-04-05 12:15:05+00:00,2,iyrUBLMZxCA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyrUBLMZxCA,[music] stocks trading lower heading into the closing bell and what's proving to be a sour start to the second quarter we're looking at how to navigate the big picture with the yahoo finance playbook and joining us now we've got bill baroo president of blue line futures and bob elliot co-founder and ceo ceo and cio of unlimited thanks for being here you guys really appreciate it i want to start kind of with how we're kicking off this second quarter and the selloff that we're seeing even though the sort of macro hasn't seemed to have changed very much i guess with the exception of treasury yields going a bit higher bob i'm going to take you first on this and whether you think that this selloff is justified should people be stepping in here to buy the dip well i think there's been uh a healthy rally that has occurred over the course of the last uh five months or so end of last year and early this year and what's happened is we've really repriced expectations significantly just think about consensus growth expectations in the us for 2024 went from well below one to now 2.2 for 2024 that's a big shift it's reflected in equity markets and as a result you're going to have to have even stronger outcomes uh than what we've seen lately in order to get stocks to press higher you combine that with higher bond yields and some concerns that the fed is not going to move nearly as quickly as people are expecting and this might be the start of a turning point uh in the equity market to kick off the quarter
Could The Real Economy Move to a 5% Interest Rate?,2024-04-04 12:15:03+00:00,3,ZZBnJLwYqaY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZBnJLwYqaY,the idea of saying like could the real economy tolerate you know an environment of five moving back to 5% interest rates given all the things that are going on yeah absolutely absolutely could the asset the financial economy cannot though well the financial economy you know has high sensitivity to that sort of dynamic and and obviously it depends because it depends on the essentially the duration sensitivity um you know there's a lot of assets that are out there that are not that duration sensitive but you know there are certainly many assets that are duration sensitive and what would have you know i think the question that you sort of have to pencil through is what would you know stock if interest trades go to 5% from where they are today you know that 75 let's say a 75 basis point rise at i don't know 15 years of duration you know that would get you you know again another 10 to 15% hidden stocks is that enough to derail the recovery or is that just simply um annoying for equity holders you know that we're for you know yolo nasdaq to go through the roof and never stop going down right like my my guess is it's more of that ladder which is um that you can have the real economy persist kind of okay you know persist okay and have a hit to a moderate hit to asset prices as the interest rates uh reset it's really a question of does that then be get more concern about interest rates does that create bond vental anes does that start to spook investors who so far are you know when the yield rises they come in and buy just look at the flows into the tlt like it is you know typically the way it works is for stocks when stock prices go up people buy and when stock prices go down they sell for tlt as that yield rose people were pouring into tlt buying the yield buying the yield buying the yield as long as that persists in the anticipation that it would drop later in the anticipation that would drop or just like they were looking at and they said a 5% yield is not a bad yield all considered and so uh and so as long as that dynamic persists then thing you know then probably the yields don't rise too much certainly they don't rise to whatever that crazy thing that was said back in back in october like yields are going to rise to 177% or something that you know that's probably not going to happen the real question is do they rise to five in this sort of environment as things reset or do they rise closer to six and the difference between stocks getting you know a drag of 10 to 15% versus you know 20 to 30% that's a big difference in terms of what the second order con uh uh consequences are in the real economy
How Do Higher Rates Impact Commercial Real Estate?,2024-04-03 12:15:07+00:00,4,iX3xMYpdKAc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX3xMYpdKAc,what about commercial real estate this sounds that like this would be the last thing that the commercial real estate market would need yeah i mean commercial real estate i think the challenge with commercial real estate is that it's not all that viable at 4% yields or 5% yields or six% yields um and so i think so maybe it doesn't matter as much because the question is sort of the marginal impact i think probably there is not all that big i you know i don't want to under matters whether the yields are four versus six but you know the big problem is that no one's going to the office uh as evidenced by the idea of extending and pretending if you get those rates down you know if they were going to go back down to 2% yes you still have a problem you still have the distress guys that have to come in and you have a liquidation that could probably take like savings and loans someone refers to it you know decades to unwind or repurpose but now the idea that you're in a different rate regime can only make that you know i think that situation more difficult yeah that's right i i think the main thing the main thing with the cr world is that it is almost entirely on balance sheet loans yeah and the one thing that the banking system is really really good at is extending pr pretending modifying you know terming out restructuring restructuring like that whole world like if there's one thing bankers are good at it's not necessarily making loans but they're darn good at dealing with bad loans and they have a lot of experience they have a lot of experience dealing with that and i think there's a lot of regulatory relief yeah that exists for them to you know not necessarily resolve those things immediately i i put out something a couple of weeks ago you know since c like blew up let's say everyone sted to talk about it like early last year you know the banking system has earned about $60 billion in nim from cr and they've lost $600 million so that gives you a sense as you know $60 billion of nim $600 m million of losses charge offs that have occurred that gives you a sense like this is like watching paint try it is not you know people who relate this to the financial crisis not at all the financial crisis financial crisis it's not that was the wheels coming off the entire global system this is this is this is a problem that they know how it's painful and painstaking but they have done this before in many different areas exactly exactly and banks can the whole cleverness of a bank is that they earn the income today and they take the losses over extremely long period of time and that allows them if if the losses are big enough to out earn through their nim on other assets and other loans which a resetting we have to remember that like those things are resetting nims are actually fine you know they're staying in the two and a half three% range you know three and a half for some of the smaller cohorts th those are decent nim they can absorb a lot of losses with nims like that for an extended period of time and so it doesn't mean that like you know our banks going to be making hand money hand over fist probably not are the ones that are concentrating these assets gonna you know are their stocks going to be fantastic probably not a great stock pick depends on what's priced in but you know you could easily see the stocks kind of being you know bad performers for an extended period at time but that's very different from this is the thing that's going to bring down the economy that that's a great observation because we get a lot of questions that people worried about commercial real estate and i think that that's a really really sort of accurate description of of banking nim is net interest margin everyone by the way um the amount of money bank makes on earning in on its interest in loans
Will the Fed Will Bring Rates back to 2 - 2.5%?,2024-04-02 12:15:02+00:00,4,XuCpX5-L5uc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuCpX5-L5uc,this assumption that the fed is going to bring interest rates back to 2 and a half or 3% in this cycle is like is baked in all of these different models like you know um i i'm sure you every once in a while bump into a few uh a few interviews on bloomberg and you and you listen to the bond people and basically every single bond person says well you know the long-term rate is two and a half or the fed will bring interest rates down to three like imagine those folks and that's causing them to buy to be clear that's causing them to buy yield at you know 425 at 425 if your long-term rate is two and a half actually looks like a pretty good deal uh over you know over a cycle time frame when those folks start to say i'm not so sure right i maybe i need to pencil in a higher number and we're actually seeing that in terms of surveys of professional economists and and and uh and dealers um we're starting to see that long-term rate expectation creep up when that shifts that totally changes the valuation picture on bonds uh and so you know bonds particularly risk-free bonds treasury bonds serve as the backbone of the whole economy if every you know we already saw last summer it doesn't take that big a rise to start to upend the apple cart and create some risks to stocks due to the rising discount rate if those yields rise so that's you know a lot of a lot of the rest of the financial system is really dependent upon this continued expectation that interest rates are going to be low for a long time yeah so the the argument when you hear that is that even if that the fed will go back to that rate even if they have to inflict pain to get there but you're suggesting maybe they don't go back to that right well i think i think that's part of the part of the question is if if the economy is structurally running uh hotter with higher productivity higher demand for capital lower savings rates etc um you can have an economy that continues uh and higher inflation you can have an economy that continues to be fine right you're you're you can you can have your unemployment rate at let's say five which you know be clear the average unemployment rate is five not you know not three not you know not three and a half not four it's five the idea that you could have an unemployment rate just in terms of thinking through things let's say we had you know long end yield move to five and we had unemployment rate of five that seems like a a perfectly plausible solution to the macroeconomy and that could you know and would that be that would be undesirable tactically for the fed but in a strategic sense you know a 5% unemployment rate would be fine would be a fine why asked is it in itself a bad thing it sounds like it's just settling where the economy can handle it right and as opposed to everyone hating zero interest rates and some of the repercussions that come from that and being worried about defl you're in a different regime the problem in the rub is that the system is built on expectations of it being at two or two and a half% right that those expectations you know i was like to joke the fact that the bonds are in the stocks right but the bonds are also in the credit and the bonds are in the loans and the bonds are you know bonds are in everything the bonds are in the houses you know that's that's kind of the challenge from an asset holders perspective is um is the fact that we're moving to a to a structurally higher rate may not be so bad for the real economy but it isn't great for asset holders
What Will be the New Neutral  Rate of Interest?,2024-04-01 12:15:02+00:00,4,HscRtOp-ueM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HscRtOp-ueM,if the long-term rate is closer to three and a half to 4% instead of 2% first of all let's start with is is that a likely scenario that we need to adjust to and then i'll ask part two of his question yeah i think it's it's a a cr it's a critical question um to to start to to be wrestling with uh you know i'm uh i i remember in this cycle when the short rate was at 2 and a half% and chairman paul said it was highly you know it was restrictive at 2 and a half% and you looked at like i don't think so man that and he tried you know he was trying to to to back away at that and you know even at rates at five and a half you know and in the high fours and and through to the mid fives over the course of you know basically you know a year plus growth has continued to be at or a bit above potential um and so you sort of look at that picture and you say you know the the overall sensitivity of the economy to the short rate uh to the long rate structure you know even with interest rates in the you know between four and four and a half% things are okay in the economy and so what that highlights i'd say on a tactical cyclical basis that really raises a question of uh of whether you know there's enough tightening that exist on the short end to really slow things down meaningfully or quickly um i think the question on the longer term which is what does that longer term neutral interest rate look like i think part of it is first of all a lot of uncertainty and you know there'll be seven academics in a room and you'll get seven opinions about it and seven highly quantitative models describing what's going on so you know we have to accept the ambiguity of it but i would say look there's a lot of people who talked about a two or two and a half percent rate back during the post gfc era where we had huge debt overhangs and in the private sector and depressed spending and incomes um that sort of story is not really pertinent that pertinent to today lot of the healing has happened in the private sector in terms of the balance sheets if anything we're moving to an era where we're starting to get a lot likely a lot more investment part of it supported by the government and part of it you know private sector driven to to to as a part of the de globalization dynamic so that's a draw for credit and at the same time the global savings glut has really stopped uh in a way that had existed right after the gfc where you had global central banks basically recycling liquidity into us treasuries and into into us dollars you know places like china are more concerned with their currency going down than going up these days and so you basically have this situation where probably the demand for capital on a forward-looking basis is meaningfully higher than where it was back in the in the post gfc period the supply of capital is probably lower and we've got this you know this this inflation issue which we at least have to acknowledge is more of an issue today than it was you know 10 years ago when people were more concerned about deflation you put that all together and probably the sort of baseline level of interest rates that you're seeing is probably going to be higher certainly than two and a half which is where we were for the last 15 years
A Tricky Labor Market,2024-03-30 12:15:03+00:00,2,SQDpORGD41E,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQDpORGD41E,the labor market's been tricky right because we don't know what's temporary or business cycle we don't know what's structural it seems like it's been kind of hard to figure that out what do you what are you thinking about in terms of wages yeah i mean wages are critical if you just think about like at a very simple level inflation in the economy can be seen as how much are people earning relative to what their productivity is and the difference between those two things essentially has to be prices because you know what they earn they spend and what they produce gets bought uh you know it's a little more complicated that than that in reality but that kind of gives you a good benchmark of how to think about wages and so nominal wages continue to be you know moderately elevated they've come down a little bit but still particular when you when you look at the wages of high propensity to spend income cohorts so say you're 60th percentile and below or your 80th percentile and below those wages continue to grow pretty rapidly on a nominal basis a couple let's say 2% above where they were preco um the the interesting question the key question is how much productivity are you getting out of those workers we have seen a pickup in productivity and measured productivity over the course of the last couple of quarters um back to sort of the longer term trend line if that continues then you know we can live with 5% wage growth and 3% productivity that's an okay outcome i think the real question is is that really durable over time and do we get that nominal wage growth derailed by input costs like gas gasoline prices going up you know 20 25% that that's a big deal you know if you're if you're in the lower income cohorts with with the high propensity to spend that shift in in gas prices from the low threes to the high 3es matters for you in the day-to-day basis
How to Target Above Market Returns,2024-03-29 12:15:03+00:00,4,qsjRJCDz4NE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsjRJCDz4NE,in the market historically let's say go back to 1965 or whatever the market's returned on average 8 to 9% right but this research project found that most people they only earn 5% so like there's this gap right so if you just invested in an index fund and just follow the market you'd earn 9% but people do all these weird things right and really they're they're earning below the average right the average returns meaning that 50% people are earning higher than that 50% are earning lower but what do you think contributes to that why do people you know realize returns that are less than average when there's so many resources out there and so many strategies they could follow yeah well i think the first thing is the fees you know the vast majority of investors are holding you know something instead of holding portfolio of etfs of lowcost index etfs where they're allin fee cost is something like five basis points a year they're holding extremely expensive you know mutual funds uh that charge you know hundreds of basis points of fees i mean not to mention the fact that their advisors also charging 100 basis points in fees usually on top of it and so the fees that's why part of the way that you can figure out whether your advisor is doing the right thing for you or the wrong thing for you is you just look at the fees if the fees are high then what's happening is they're getting paid and you're paying for it right in your returns that's all there is to it and so fees fees fees focus on your fees focus on bringing your fees down and then the second issue is the market timing issue which is that instead of dollar cost averaging into these assets over time people are trying to time the market when you try time the market i mean literally there's an entire hedge fund industry built upon taking money from individual investors who poorly time the market so every time you're going there and thinking hey look i i want to trade or i don't you know i want to trade today or i want to shift between cash and assets or i want to sell my stocks and buy this or buy this individual stock or sell this individual stock recognize that there is an entire industry that makes 700 billion dollar a year yeah built on the back of people making that set of decisions poorly and so what you know the way to avoid essentially that cost right that index drag is what you're you're talking about is simply to calmly and uniformly buy the market every month put a little bit of money away buy a diversified portfolio of assets and frankly if you do that the best portfolio that you can have is one you don't even think about right you don't even worry about you there's lots of things to worry about your job about you know your family about your health there's so many things in this world world to worry about there's no reason why you should worry about your investment portfolio yeah right and that's the basic idea is create yourself a long-term game plan that you can stick to and that won't cause you you know that's lowc cost well diversified and you know something that you can you can stick to through time right where you're not trading uh all the time and you'll be good you'll be good in 30 years it'll it'll be a good outcome for you
What's Happening with Inflation?,2024-03-28 12:15:04+00:00,3,w58a1AEdVMw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w58a1AEdVMw,we just feel that stickiness of of certain things just don't seem to be going down or you know there's periodic food depending on what you're buying get a break on eggs something else jumps up it it doesn't feel like we're having this really rapid deceleration so um i mean it still may happen though right inflation lags doesn't it yeah well i i think the the complicated thing with inflation is that there's a bunch of different you know moving pieces that are sometimes moving counter to each other so you know the initial bout of disinflation coming from the fact that gas prices went from 5 to three which then flow you know flows into all sorts of different places in the economy and then also a big shift downward in durable goods as the supply chain issues started to get resolved started to see a drop in in auto in used auto prices in particular but also imported durable goods and so that created like a big disinflationary impulse on the economy and brought inflation down considerably i think the key question you know and at the same time the services side of things you know you can look at a lot of different pieces of it but certainly not moving rapidly down um it certainly remains relatively elevated i think the challenge is as we look ahead some of those big disinflationary impulses that existed with you know oil prices and gas prices falling and and having another leg down through the end of the year but now reversing and you know up 6070 cents depending on exactly what what you look at and having those durable goods prices that were falling now starting you know starting to rise i thought it was one of the more interesting pieces of the inflation report was goods durable goods disinflation started to flip to inflation it's not a good sign at a time when those sort of the the services side of thing just isn't moving down as fast as certainly the fed would hope that's not a great combination on a forward-looking basis and and so i think that's when when chairman paul talks about needing more evidence that's what he means you know it's not like no one no one's sitting here thinking oh inflation is going to go to 5% or 10% anytime soon the question is are we are we stabilizing at three or are we stabilizing at two in a in a compelling way um and i think that's that's the question that he's got on his mind and i think there's good evidence to suggest that maybe they shouldn't be confident that it is there particularly on a forward-looking basis
The Market is More than Stocks,2024-03-27 12:15:01+00:00,3,H6jg2g7jouw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6jg2g7jouw,think a lot of us are uh have sort of grown up sort of thinking you know the market is the stock market and stocks do well in certain periods and don't do well in other periods but the reality is there's a lot of other financial assets out there that because of their nature do well in environments when stocks don't do well now most people have bonds and they know something about bonds the trouble with bonds is usually people are holding too small a portion of their portfolio in bonds or they're holding bonds that have too little volatility they're not moving around enough relative to the stocks that are moving around a lot u but bonds are a good asset that typically outperform in environments where growth is slowing and that is an environment typically when stocks are falling but there's a lot of other assets that are out there that also do well in those sorts of environments for instance gold uh which uh has a variety of different properties outperforms bonds 60% of the the time uh in periods gold outper forms bonds 60% of the times in which stocks are down so it would make sense if you're building a portfolio you have your stocks you have your bonds you should also have about as much gold in your portfolio as you have bonds in your portfolio because bonds are outperforming uh stock gold is outperforming bonds often when stocks are down and then further there's other assets that are out there things like commodities that do well in high inflation environments for instance if we see the last 18 months what we've seen in in the last 18 months is that commodities are one of the few assets that are up stocks are down bonds are down gold is flat and commodities are up so and and why is that because we've been in an inflationary environment and so why not add commodities to your portfolio in order to help you uh do well in an environment where inflation is elevated relative to expectations and so the reason why i sort of go through each one of these different pieces is each one has a certain set of properties that are related to a certain set of macro environments uh and market environments economic environments that they do they do well in certain environments that it's not just about holding stocks it's about holding a diverse set of those assets that do well uh kind of regard at least you have something doing well regardless of the market or economic environment
Evaluate A Portfolio by 3 Criteria,2024-03-26 12:15:01+00:00,2,JbvryeUVC48,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbvryeUVC48,sometimes what folks really focus on is um they'll look at the stock market and they'll say well the stock market's up or the stock market's down and what does my performance look like relative to the stock market but the problem with the stock market is the volatility in the stock market is usually way higher than what you want to have necessarily in your 401k let's say and the reason why that is is stocks can go you know they can go up a lot but they also can go down by as much as 2/3 in a typical economic cycle and 2/3 is an extraordinary loss that most people are not going to accept in their 401ks or their portfolios that that's not an acceptable loss for them to experience and so i think part of the question should be asked look at the assets that are in there are they over meaningfully overweight stocks and remember stocks are a lot more volatile than bonds so even a 6040 portfolio 98% of the risk of that portfolio is driven by stocks so the question is are you seeing a portfolio that is diversified number one and number two what i'd emphasize is are you seeing elevated fees now for 41k most of the fees are pretty low but as you get to advisor managed accounts fees are a good sign that you're not getting a good deal so if you run down that list and you start to see fees in the 150 basis point 200 basis point 300 basis point or god forbid investing in lp structures that are charging 800 basis points of fees like the world of fees is just a loss for the investor and so instead if you see a portfolio that's oriented around very lowcost index funds charging say 10 basis 0 point uh 1% of fees right that's a good sign that's a sign that the your advisor is operating in your best interest if you see very high fee products that's the sort of thing that you should really start to ask real questions about why you know why are you getting charged 250 basis points of fees on a on an asset that you're seeing
Why Diversify Your Investment Portfolio?,2024-03-25 12:15:01+00:00,2,JA2QuO6r9WI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA2QuO6r9WI,what what comes into focus for most investors is the need to have to think about are they diversified right and so that's really the the test or the question that you want to be asking your advisor um and when i say diversified what that means is diversified across different industries diversified across uh different geographies uh and diversified across different assets and and the reason why that is is because if you think if you think about what's going on in any one particular asset or market all the smartest people in the world are looking at that those assets and those markets and they're trying to price what the highest you know what the right price is for that asset and so if you're gonna diverge from sort of a generally diversified portfolio you've got to believe that you're better that those tilts are better than the collective wisdom of everyone in the market who's investing in it and i promise you that your financial adviser does not have the wisdom to be able to do that well the people who do this well and repeatedly over years and years spend their entire lives focused on how to pick stocks sectors assets etc and use highly sophisticated understanding they have huge research teams they spend billions of dollars your financial advisor does not do that and so if your financial adviser comes to you and says hey look i like you know evs or i like the green revolution or i like this or i like that the question you should be asking yourself as an investor is do i think this person across the table has unique edge in picking that and the answer is almost always no right
How to Approach Investing,2024-03-22 12:15:06+00:00,5,uFWwdgTll60,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFWwdgTll60,"well i think um a longterm for most investors a long-term approach and perspective is is critically important i think if anything most investors the biggest problem that most investors have is that they're actually trying to time things y uh on a tactical basis and if you come from sort of the traditional you know from the sophisticated asset uh market business you know an investing business the way i have i've spent 20 years basically building sophisticated systematic strategies you know there is a lot of work a lot of work to get to the point where you think you have edge in timing markets over uh you know three six nine 12 month time frame for most investors you can't beat you know the people who are pouring money into beating the market and building you know building hedge funds and things like that and so you're much better off focused on how do you build a long-term strategic portfolio that's going to be successful for you that you know over time will will work out you know from the time that you save to the time that you retire yeah absolutely so with the rise of brokerage accounts individual brokerage accounts it's really easy now to go open account at charles schwab or public.com or robin hood or whatever it may be and you can start investing immediately right and and i think a lot of people are doing that and you see the trends like there's a lot of trends where there's money leaving these institutional financial advisory practices because people are starting to think why would i spend all this money paying fees right to um somebody who's managing this mutual fund charging me a 2% fee when i could just invest in an index fund that charges 0 point something x percent right well i think with this trend you see a lot of people opening these individual brokerage accounts they get wind over here that xyz stock is going to double over the next six months and they just go buy it right or their friend tells them oh oh you know i have a buddy who developed this algorithm this is something i heard recently they developed this algorithm and they're just making a ton of money so like i'm gonna pay them for this course or i'm gonna like invest my money with them and then they're you know $20,000 goes down to $2 so talk a little bit about that what you're seeing in the market with hype or with gambling or with speculating what are your thoughts on that i am sympathetic uh to folks who feel like the traditional infrastructure for asset management isn't really serving them uh you know it is it's true that like your old school financial adviser that puts you into 6040 and charges you a few hundred basis points in fees like mostly sucks um and so finding an opportunity that's outside that infrastructure makes a ton of sense but i think the challenge is is that um people think particularly after sort of 15 years where stocks have have mostly gone up basically in in a relatively straight line that uh that they can pick what what's likely to be win a winner and what's likely not to be a winner and uh the reality is that that's very hard and if you've been around a few cycles as an institutional asset manager the thing that you have most of all is the humility to understand how hard it is to pick and anyone stock in any one time frame maybe goes up maybe it goes down um but as the as the day-to-day the retail investor who you're betting against on that are the most sophisticated asset managers in the world and the odds that you do better than them are pretty low and so you might make money actually if anything it's the worst thing to do is to make money on sort of your short on some very you know small stock concentrated stock bets because then you'll keep going in just in the way you will if you make money at the blackjack table keep putting bets on thinking that you can chase those positive returns and ultimately the vast majority of smallscale investors lose money trading individual stocks like that the dumb money folks right the vast majority of those people lost money trading individual meme stocks and that's what you have to remember uh much better to focus on a strategic portfolio that you can live with than trying to trade day-to- day exactly"
Not All in Is Prudent Portfolio Management,2024-03-21 12:15:00+00:00,2,-GF75JeMkVI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GF75JeMkVI,and that and we don't really know and that is such an important thing when you're navigating recognizing that you don't know what the sensitivity of the economy is to monetary policy is critical to being able to navigate through this market well and i think that's where the macro then starts to move into that you got to manage money right and the recognition of these other positions that you have are diversifying they considering the probable outcomes that could occur and just because you're you're saying well maybe it's all gold delocks there's a 30% probability of that that doesn't mean you weigh your portfolio with a zero allocation to the assets that would do well in that right right if you're if you're well calibrated you would have a probabilistic waiting to some of these outcomes as as you navigate and continue to course correct going through the uncertainty right right that's exactly right is you want to want to be able you want to be careful to not go all in on one of these outcomes like that is the most prudent way to manage through this cycle is is not not allin and the other thing i would really emphasize is it's not just not allin but also because you're uncertain like why are you taking full full like whole hog leverage like whole hog risk like there's there's no you don't have to like like it's as if people don't recognize like hey you just hold cash like cash is fine like you know if if it if it helps you sleep better at night um it's fine it's fine to to dris
Macro Managers Bet on Diversification,2024-03-20 12:15:04+00:00,4,ud97wnTtVnM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud97wnTtVnM,you know i'm gonna i'm gonna uh separate that maybe from other places in macro um the best macro managers the the most the the absolute best macro managers in the world are 60% right 55 to 60% right in any trade in one market in one month just think about that like yeah at a high level that's not very good that's actually pretty bad in the scheme of things right relative to like what the world considers expertise and so part of what you have to do because macro is so um imprecise right since your signal to noise is so low is what you do is you have to create a lot of bets because if what you do is you you have 20 bets that are 5545 with a reasonable amount of reliability 5545 actually you can build you can build a you know one to 1.5 gross of v sharp ratio and if you do that you'll build the biggest institutional asset manage you know the biggest hedge fund in the world right like like think about that that's what it that's what it takes fundamental law of asset management absolutely yep right but the trick the trick is diversification like that really is the trick in the macro sense which is you know i was trading currencies there's 50 you know 50 major liquid uh exchange rates that are out there and like the idea was try to get yourself to 55 45 or even 53 or 54 if you can get yourself at that point and get enough diversification enough balance enough things like that you can actually do something that's pretty good but if you looked at any one of the things you'd kind of be like you know kind of garbagey right like not that good yeah and so that's kind of the you know just get get that coin in your favor yeah yeah no no we we we we hammer that that drum all the time that you know most if you look at any of the individual edges that we use that the size of the edge is vanishingly small if you look at all of those edges applied to a single market it's marginally better if it's only when you apply all of those edges across all of those markets at a trade frequency a sufficient trade frequency that balances you know your edge against the friction right the the cost of having to trade that you actually are able to generate the one 1.52 sharp ratios that everybody you know is is looking for and so few can deliver but diversification is such a huge it's a huge yeah and and and i feel like the um i feel like the the you know the the twitter wor verse or the popular media like every everyone is like i don't know is the fed gonna pivot in june or not or whatever july like that's that's one bet like that genuinely that's how i look at that it's like you know i don't know probably i think probably not but like that's about how good it is is it's like one bet you know one bet of ideally you know hundreds of bets that you'll have on overtime and so like also on the flip side whoever calls that bet right like recognize that the odds that they got lucky are at least 45% right there's the odds that they got lucky because if there you know if they were the best in the world the odds that they got lucky wor 45% right yeah right right more likely the odds that they were lucky are something closer to 50% and so also it's about looking at the process the process not the not you know to get to understand whether if run over enough sample size you're going to get something that actually works through time
How to Make Sense of Macro Data?,2024-03-19 12:15:02+00:00,5,Sj5LEzBANb0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj5LEzBANb0,there's there's a good question in the chat um from my partner rodrigo we struggle with this internally about how to effectively make use of macro data because the frequency of the data is so low right so you're looking at monthly data you just don't have enough data points or enough full economic cycles or what have you to be able to draw strong statistical conclusions um and make strong statistical inferences for forecasting purposes so maybe close the loop on that for us i mean i think you you've answered some of it but yeah yeah well i think i think i i take two uh i'd approach it answer two different points on that which is um one uh i actually i i recently was writing about this in the context of the employment report like most people they look at the us employment report and they're what they're trying to do is they're trying to find the thing that tells them what's going on right the indicator the ser iies the whatever that is leading and the thing that's very interesting about i think the most sophisticated macro investors and what they're actually doing is they're processing all of it right they're basically saying let me look at all the different indications of this assess its goodness and put together a comprehensive and probabilistic picture of what's going on that's what you're doing and so part of the way that you beat the dir of data points problem is by looking comprehensively like if if the question is what is going on with the labor market in the us the answer is there are hundreds of different ways to look at that problem that together i think paint a you know you can synthesize a picture together on it and so that's part of the way that you increase real-time sample size and some are more timely and less timely and like there's a lot that you can do there to to increase your resolution to to create you're never going to have certainty you're going to have a probabilistic sense of the range of what's likely happening right that's what you're going to get to but you can get a fair amount of information about that and then when it comes to this the through time part of it which is a big part of it how do you know you know people talk about the yield curve to trade stocks right the yield curve for recession right you've got like seven instances there are people who like have won nobel prizes you know inferring what's happened with seven data points which yeah right you know like a real quant looks at you and you're like you gotta be kidding me like what's the statistical significance of this and and the reality is that in macro in particular there's not enough statistical significance to be able to run traditional quant models and so what you have to do this is the art and the science is you have to balance that idea of intuitive fundamental understanding with what you think how you think it should work with an observational testing to say is that actually how it plays plays out and that is actually part of the there's a big there's a real discipline you have to have there to basically say i'm not what i'm not going to i'm gonna in a very disciplined way say here's how i think the world works then i'm gonna go test that what i'm not going to do is if that ends up being false or not a particularly good indicator i'm not going to like tweak the optimization to get myself to a point where it's going to be better and better and better because you can always with you know seven cycles postwar or whatever i i promise i can find you a million things that look great that test great look great whatever and part of the discipline is saying no the thing that will be durable is the thing that's rational and intuitive about how human nature and how people should react and respond and for those things that are good like yes that that that i can have confidence like if i have good intuition and i have empirical evidence that's pretty good doesn't have to be perfect but pretty good then i can be confident in that and if it doesn't work out like you throw it away and you don't cheat you can't cheat that's a big thing no cheat

"Systemization is Imperfect, But Freeing",2024-03-17 12:15:02+00:00,4,gODe09V8zpk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gODe09V8zpk,this is our you know this is the holistic understanding i have what isn't working consistent with my holistic understanding what is working with my consistent with my holistic understanding and what it does i mean systemization it is like freeing because it frees the mind from having to like rebuild the understanding over and over again like that's the thing the discipline and the leverage are the things that are so value about valuable about systemization and those far outweigh the fact that it's going to be imperfect right so often people get kind of confused like well you the a systematic approach is an imperfect approach it's like well like damn straight it's an imperfect approach but it's a whole heck of a lot better than an approach where you're trying to like mentally reprocess everything with all of your emotions every single day right like that is a way worse approach and a much more taxing approach than a systematic one now i view the i view the dashboard as being something more than a dashboard and providing more like um you know ppp for for the yen is is this um in expected inflation in japan is this um economic growth is is this the nick has done this over the last three sixth whatever like a a basket of kind of um reasonable sort of intermediately moving or or evolving indicators and then a system of that provides kind of an outside view of you know here's the conditional probability of certain outcomes right um given a you know some number of combination of these different meaningful indicators that you know you've got some of some sort of theoretical rational for why these indicators should be explanatory of the e ecomic machine and how markets should evolve in response to the economic machine right so it's not just like a bunch of dials and dashboards am i right that there's also along with those dashboards a variety of sort of conditional inferences that represent kind of basy and priors on look if you want to be short the yen here if this constellation of uh indicators typically is suggestive that we should that the probability is that the yen's going to appreciate over the next months so that should skew your or or temper your enthusiasm to go against that the or or to to you know coales that thesis is that a decent intuition or i i i think any good i'd call it systematic process what it's doing is it's just it's taking your logic right your intuitions uh going through a process of saying are those intuitions good intuitions or bad meaning like how much goodness do those those ideas have and then a calibration process calibration process which is important because there are certain things that have better goodness and other things that have worse goodness and other things that have no goodness or negative goodness
Insight Into Systematic Investing,2024-03-16 12:15:02+00:00,3,_G3kpqcMfZM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3kpqcMfZM,when we say systematic i think um often people think about like traditional quant and i wouldn't quite describe it's not it was not um it is not a traditional quanti type process it's more systematic in the sense of like using data and logic and decision rules to determine what position should be across markets and then building portfolio you know views and portfolios and things like that and so that's really kind of what it is and i think the process the process of developing a systematic approach to managing money is um in a lot of ways you what you do is you use systemization to help create leverage so instead of coming in every day and saying well the yen's you know ppp is this and the interest rate differential is this and the the you know instead of having to like recalculate that in your mind every day which is stupid because like compu pretty good at that um and what you could do is you just take that data in process it based upon your you know buy and llarge your existing understanding and and start with something that is a pretty good representation of how you would think about what's going on in the world and then i think the main thing that uh that and that creates there's all sorts of reasons why you want to do that because it creates discipline and it removes the emotion and you're not getting hung up on the news of the day and all those things all those things that are pra frankly like intellectual um there there are problems of human nature that can be that need to be resolved through discipline and systemization is an effective discipline right that's it's most most it is leveraging and disciplined and those are the two most effective things that it does but necessarily there's always things the world is evolving your understanding is evolving your thinking is evolving so there's always things that are incremental that could get better in that understanding over time and that's really what that process is which is you see what's going on in the world you see how you how you think things are playing out then you see how they are playing out and then you're constantly going back and forth and observing things you may have missed you may not have understood you know things like that and that generates questions and from questions become you know ideas of what are the other decision rules that should be used
Does Talk of a Recession Make Sense?,2024-03-15 12:15:00+00:00,3,0dngfhDQ_lg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dngfhDQ_lg,why when i see another analyst or other analysts talk about recession and how they see the risk of recession gaining momentum i kind of scratch my head over that do you yeah i i do i do sometimes because um you know i think part of it is there's always the ability to cherry-pick some data point yeah yeah um and you know make a sky is falling sort of case i think the the to to do to understand the macroeconomy well remain requires understanding it holistically and so that's why whenever we talk i'm i'm talking about what's going on with gdp in aggregate what's going on with the overall unemployment rate and the overall labor market conditions because that's that's what matters you know for for all of for for you know in its entirey doesn't mean that there aren't certain pockets of folks that are stressed right now that's certainly true it's just in in general you know most households are doing pretty well with their 401ks rising equity markets rising house prices rising and you know they're mostly employed with pretty good wage income you put that all together that's a pretty good story i mean particularly for the middle class this is you know one of the better circumstances we've had for the middle class honestly 20 or 30 years yeah yep the the the biggest headwind that we've got is affordability stinks uh you know when you when you start adding up the inflation rate over the last three years uh it you you get to that bottom line and and affordability stinks and it's being reflected in in consumer debt right well i think that's that's part of the flip side you know if you're if you're a house you know if you're if you're working a middle class job and your wages are going up and your house price is going up and and you know you've locked in a low mortgage things are looking pretty good for you but that doesn't mean that prices haven't risen i think we all feel that every day how prices have risen so you know your stocks may be up but you're asking yourself am i actually you know can i can i keep consuming more as a function of that um you know in real terms rather than you know paying paying more and then i think you know there's a fair amount of folks who have been left behind particularly uh younger folks who aren't homeowners um who are struggling right who aren't necessarily getting as as good a wage growth who don't have the asset savings that they're benefiting from they're getting squeezed and they're trying to make ends meat by you know going in into debt whether it's more student debt or credit card debt and so that's really the the group in the economy that is is um is really falling behind it's not sort of boomers or gen gen x or millennials it's really the gen z group that is really struggling at this point and you can see their disaffection in a lot of different ways
Fiscal Policy Continues to Stimualte a Strong U S  Economy,2024-03-14 12:15:07+00:00,3,rypP7wKh3rE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rypP7wKh3rE,part of the part of the issue here is the fiscal policy from the administration with the you know continuing to put money into the system and and that is a variable that powell is dealing with that maybe past uh uh chairman of the fed haven't had to deal with correct yeah that's right i mean typically when you have you know unemployment rates at under 4% yeah those are times actually to balance the budget or even run surpluses like we saw uh you know in the 90s and in other periods uh back through history uh and and what's going on right now is is radically different from that we're running six to s% of gdp deficits those are those are the types of deficits that were run in the in the financial crisis right when you know conditions were very weak uh in the in the us we're running those sorts of financial crisis deficits at a time when the econom is pretty good and i think that you know um you know that coming from congress and the and the administration together are you know making a decision to run very stimulative policy which is yeah which is keeping pressures on inflation either directly or indirectly for sure right okay the other economic data that we're getting bob it it uh it suggests that this economy is really doing okay isn't it it sure is i mean we're we're you know the numbers are adding up in a way that looks like we're going to get our seventh straight quarter of you know gdp growth at 2% or better on a real gdp basis um that's pretty good uh for for the us economy um and you know combined with the fact that uh we're seeing labor markets that remain pretty tight i mean particularly if you're trying to hire in any sort of service industry you know somewhere outside of uh outside of the coasts you know it's very hard to get high quality uh good skilled labor um pretty much anywhere at this point without paying up for it and so you know those two things the growth dynamics and and the tightness of the labor market they both speak to the fact that you know the economy is doing pretty well and with this you know with these sort of asset price increases that we're seeing um you know stocks are pushing new highs you know bon yels haven't ren risen all that much they're down you know 100 basis points from where they were last summer you know the the the dynamics are in place to keep this economic momentum uh you know uh for the next 3 or six months at least
What Does the Fed's Testimony in Congress Indicate?,2024-03-13 12:15:00+00:00,2,3k3QBTGCWr8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k3QBTGCWr8,well i think in a lot of ways you know with the press conferences that the fed does every six weeks these days um there's a lot of communications a lot of what is being said is being repeated and reemphasized which is you know the basic story is uh the economy is doing pretty well uh from a growth perspective inflation's coming down it's still a little too high um from the fed's perspective and they need to get you know they need to get more confident in inflation being durably beat before they start uh an interest rate cutting cycle and so um you know the fact that cuts might be on the horizon is uh a certainly a positive particularly for financial markets and we're seeing that broadly the last couple of days um but you the data has to come through in order to give the fed confidence to do the cuts that many are hoping for what are your thoughts on that bob is i is inflation is the cap back on the inflation bottle well i think i think most people living in their day-to-day uh would would certainly have a bone to pick with the idea that inflation is be um and uh you know the fed follows this the the a certain set of data and what i'd say there is that it's it's obviously quite meaningfully improved since where we were you know when inflation was running at n9ine or 10% uh on a year-over-year basis but it certainly doesn't look totally beat i think there's a real risk when you look at the the dat and the dynamics going on that we get inflation that kind of settles in the sort of 3 to four range rather than in the one to2 range which is what the fed's targeting um and you know some of the things that have been such a support to bringing inflation down slowing inflation like you know falling gas prices as an example going from five bucks a gallon to three bucks a gallon well now that's creeping back up and that flows into other other prices throughout the economy and so i think there's reasons to believe that it may not be totally beat
What Happened to SVB in March 2023?,2024-03-12 12:15:00+00:00,3,H1BBu4x5AOo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1BBu4x5AOo,well we saw a very classic run on the bank s svb had had a few problems it wasn't it wasn't a great bank going into the circumstance but what we saw was uh after the announcement a couple of days ago uh basically the venture capital community creating a run on the bank by announcing that everyone should be pulling their money out and those who could did and almost immediately the fdic recognized that that didn't make the bank a sustainable enterprise and stepped right in to stop things mostly on in in order to ensure that depositors were protected as much as possible so it was a good thing that the fdic stepped in to protect the depositors even though of course the equity holders took significant losses so uh what really comes down to this is a symptom of rising rates and it's a lagging symptom of rising r i mean these hikes happened last year that caused the bond portfolio of silicon valley bank to be worth less and now the economic difficulties now one might argue are causing their deposit levels to go down so they had to go and sell those bonds and now people right are are freaking out for somewhat understandable reason if you didn't get your money out of silicon valley bank yesterday the day before today you wish you had so what is the broader market market implication here because yes silicon valley bank is an important story but where else are we potentially seeing rising rate impacts that you know the frog's been boiled up to this point but but it's about to die well i think the big question is whether the fed steps in and the fdic steps in to stop any risks to the broader smaller bank ecosystem because right now uh basically you know svb is a top 20 banking institution in in the country and i think one of the questions is do you want to hold your deposits at a bank that isn't one of the big money center banks if the fed isn't going to protect the the depositors in the svb situation then it calls into question whether you should be holding holding your your deposits anywhere in the smaller banking system as opposed to the to the big banks and that could create a cascading effect that really has not much to do with the core banking infrastructure of the us economy or even the activities that those banks are doing it's it's a it's a classic bank run the question is are they going to actually do what's necessary to help halt that because right now when we look at what's going on in the markets we're seeing significant repricing of those smaller banks that might be affected by uh the secondary effects of this situation
How to FInd Diversified Alpha?,2024-03-11 13:15:03+00:00,3,gqc67nQwWxA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqc67nQwWxA,can you also dig a little bit more into the diversified alpha thing you know one of the things people always say about alpha is it's very hard to find and people who have it you know lose it over time so how do you think about like finding consistent sources of alpha that'll persist well i think probably in this um in this portfolio that's probably the most challenging piece of things is to how how do you find consistent uh alpha and to be clear at a reasonable cost right a consistent net of fees alpha because there's a lot of good managers out there that generate very good um very good alpha and then basically just take all the alpha away for themselves and fees and leave investor is not that much better off uh than they would be on their own and so identifying good alphas means going through and looking for managers that offer a good consistent alpha at a low cost so you know you should be looking for managers that have a fee structure where maybe they're taking 20 for % of the alpha that they're generating and where um where the alpha that they're generating is you know is uh is meaningful relative to you know just a a plain index fund so you know you're not going to spend much time you know looking for um you know looking for little pieces of uh of alpha or basis points of alpha you want something that's that's meaningful and so i mean the good thing is there's been a real proliferation of etf structures uh and and better and better alphas in uh in the etf context that you can go out and you can invest there's there's lots of great managers that now are operating in that etf rapper that you can go out and uh and and find and include in your portfolio the key thing is just not get overweight on one particular manager one particular style one particular strategy get it's it's all about the diversification just in the same way you want to diversify your passive port portfolio your betas you also want to diversify your alphas because you know some alphas do well in certain environments and other alphas do well in other environments and so creating that balance is is really the key you know not getting overweight on any particular strategy or manager
How to Think About a Savings Investment Portfolio,2024-03-09 13:15:03+00:00,2,EPiGoDw2dE0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPiGoDw2dE0,at sort of a high level almost like a financial adviser would and sort of ask you the question like what when you think about your portfolio and your investments and your goals what would you say the long-term objectives are yeah it's a good question and and obviously in some ways the the key the key place to start when when i think about a savings portfolio investment portfolio for for me and and my family um i'm really focused on how do i create create uh sort of durable long-term wealth creation um and at the same time not worry too much about it um and those two things are uh important to connect to each other because in a lot of ways um you know being in the asset management business uh both you know originally being you know at at a at a hedge fund and now running my own business means that i have you know significant highly concentrated and somewhat volatile exposure to what happens in the financial markets and the success of uh the products and the investment management that i'm doing the last thing you want to be doing in that context is worrying too much about your accumulated savings over time savings for a person who has a volatile income should be boring right which is different if you have a a low volatility income then it makes sense maybe to spend more time and have more volatility on your savings but for me really focused on sort of that long-term wealth creation low volatility um moderately good returns and something i don't really need to worry about too much in the dayto day
Will Markets React to Trump vs  Biden?,2024-03-08 13:15:02+00:00,2,qGkEUijH2-Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGkEUijH2-Q,and i say to you fiscally to me both these candidates represent fiscal laress bob to you first of all it would reinforce your 5% call on yields if there really is a fiscal mandate coming let's say from the trump house but how do you think markets will inch towards the november election well i think they're probably not going to be particularly influenced by uh whether the election outcome is uh either favors trump or or favors biden there may be certain individual stocks uh that might benefit or uh or not based upon the incremental difference in the policy um like higher tax stocks benefiting from a trump administration um but that's pretty on the margin relative to the fact that both of these uh presidents if they were to come into into office they're going to run very large fiscal deficits and be supported by congress in doing so and what that does is two things it perpetuates uh a support to the macroeconomy and the continued strength y in addition to the fact of creating all that bond supply to fund those large deficits on an ongoing basis yeah well let's see what the radiance agencies have got to say about that depending on on on who sits on capital hill
The State of the U.S. Economy in March 2024,2024-03-07 13:15:04+00:00,3,jHL1sO1KREo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHL1sO1KREo,let talk about the no landing no r cut scenario uh bob i take it you're a little bit less less keen on joining the no r cut camp today well i think the main thing to focus on is the ordering because the ordering of market conditions is going to determine the fed's policy and the way that i describe it is uh as long as until bond yields rise the fed is not going to cut and the reason why that is is that under the current interest rate structure this economy does have an incredible amount of momentum asset prices are reaching new highs you know employment continues to chug along income growth is strong and so what interrupts that cycle is uh is it doesn't just fall on in on itself what has to happen is we have to have a rise in bond yields that rise in bond yields has to start to slow the asset price appreciation and that has to start to shift the amount of demand coming from consumers but the ordering matters so uh that's why i like to say until rates rise the fed will not cut but bob the the rates market has retested near-term highs without any demonstrative hit on the equity market so are you talking about a more extreme pricing in bonds to the upside yeah i mean just think about if you just go back last summer what we saw is we saw b yields rise uh up to five and we only got a modest equity correction in response to that and not nearly enough for long enough in terms of the rate rise to create a drag on the economy now fast forward we're basically you know nine months later six to nine months later um and asset prices are reaching even higher levels there's even more positive momentum in the economy we're seeing actually cyclical upticks in areas like manufacturing global exports etc and so in order to get that slowing at this point we probably need to move yields back up to the five or even higher in order to slow the economy well you're trying to give you're sort of trying to give people a a little bit of a heart attack here
What's The Key To Building a Savings Portfolio?,2024-03-06 13:15:02+00:00,2,T5JdZuS_pfA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5JdZuS_pfA,i want to ask you briefly about international exposure because that that's a big debate you see out there right now is we've had this period where the us has just killed international markets for a really really long period of time and and some people think it's similar to the 6040 where it's it's happened for a long period of time but it's going to reverse at some point and i'm just wondering how do you think at like a high level about international exposure like in the importance of having it in a portfolio yeah well i i think for um sort of goes back to like you know do you have any edge in figuring this out and i think the answer is you know most people don't have any edge in terms of figuring it out and so um more diversification is better than less diversification um and just because the us has outperformed over the course of the last uh 10 years uh or 15 years doesn't mean that it will outperform in the future i i've been in this business long enough to remember when people thought the us you know equity market was dead and we should just only invest in emerging markets because that's where all the alpha is or you know you should only invest in small caps because that's where the where the incremental alpha is and never invest in large caps like things that you know sort of are taken for granted today as being sort of truth that us mega caps are the you know are clearly the are obviously the best companies in the world you know it wasn't that long ago when that's the the exact opposite of that was was what everyone thought was obvious and so if you're building a portfolio that is meant to be you know simp that you're building over a 40 or 50e time frame a savings portfolio what you want to do is you just want to build a diverse set of exposures and so that would mean you know holding a basket of both us securities as well as international stocks as part of that portfolio

Diversifying Slightly From a 60/40 Portfolio,2024-03-04 13:15:03+00:00,2,QxHmVTvzxsY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxHmVTvzxsY,you know you're building a portfolio that's not based upon getting lucky in terms of your pecs you're building a portfolio that you don't have to worry about right that's what you're trying to do you don't have to worry about it and so uh you know those people who are were cheering how well stocks have done in the last 18 months were also uh very concerned you know just 18 months ago when stocks were in a 25% trw down um what do you think about this portfolio and particularly benchmarking i i think for particularly for advisors you know peer risk is a real thing and and i think it we'd be silly as issuers to fail to recognize that um if you're sitting in advisor seat and concerned about how much you're tracking relative to the 6040 one of the things you can do is start to think about how can you tilt your portfolio to get in this direction or client's portfolios to get in this direction but also keeping enough tracking close to 60/40 that you don't create that pure risk so just a simple example if you just took 6040 and then you took 10% out of it and allocated to gold and 10% out of it and allocated to diversified commodities and 10% and allocated it to let's say diversified alpha you get a portfolio outcome that's still like 90% correlated to 6040 but has meaningfully improved something like 50% improved uh return relative to risk over time and so that could be a balance that could be the r answer if you're benchmarking to 60/40 is benchmark there and don't go all the way to a risk parity portfolio and you know 20% managed futures and all this this uh you know this this sort of radical portfolio simple game plan portfolio that i'm proposing here but move in that direction use the lessons that this type of of allocation shows to incrementally improve your client's portfolio while not introducing too much business risk
How Do You Get Risk Parity in a Portfolio?,2024-03-03 13:15:00+00:00,3,9HCjGE25Tck,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HCjGE25Tck,how do you think about risk parity i just know when when you look at the risk parity strategies out there there's a lot of them you know there's people who say you know you just need these core assets and that that's more than enough to get capture you know the returns of risk perry then there's people who hold all kinds of crazy things like how do you think about that i mean as an investors evaluating like different risk parody strategies what are the principles you would use well i i think uh at one level it doesn't matter that much uh and the thing that matters the most is that you just have diverse you know exposure to a diverse set of of assets and and when i say that i emphasize u and in particular looking at that portfolio allocation on a risk basis rather than on a capital basis so if you take the typical 640 investor they hold you know the s&p 500 and let's say the global egg or or us egg uh uh bond index well you know stocks have a lot more volatility than than the bond eg and and as a result essentially you know that the portfolio the typical 60/40 portfolio is like 98% correlated to the stock market so like who cares you're not getting anything out of your bonds right that's the problem with capital allocating is because the bonds just don't matter in the context of the overall portfolio so really at the core of a of a risk parry portfolio is to say instead of allocating based upon capital allocate based upon risk uh and you could do that in a bunch of different ways frankly you could just take you know the four main asset classes which is you know stocks bonds commodities and gold and just allocate them equally on a risk basis and you basically have what you're looking for right i mean so it you know so you could balance your economic exposures you could not balance your economic exposures you can just balance your asset exposures and it's mostly fine the key thing is to just get away from the all stock portfolio or the all stock and bond portfolio and build that diverse asset
A 60/40 Portfolio Has Worked for 40 Years  Why?,2024-03-02 13:15:04+00:00,4,qNEHHPQVWU8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNEHHPQVWU8,we've experienced 40 years of disinflationary growth in the us economy and really across the developed world and um and the environment of you know global peace and integration uh and the outcome of that has been that the two assets that do the best in good growth and lower and falling low and falling inflation which are stocks and bonds have done the best and make up the core portfolio that most investors are holding at any point in time and so you know it the 6040 portfolio is there's nothing magic about the 6040 portfolio it's in a lot of ways just the optimized portfolio for the recent experience and when i say recent i mean like the last 40 years kind of experience and one that you know everyone feels comfortable with given their experience but just because we just we went through a period of 40 years of you know falling inflation low and stable inflation and pretty good growth um combined you know extended by a period of extraordinary monetary stimulation doesn't necessarily mean that the next four years are going to look anything like that and so i think that's part of the the challenge is how do you create a game plan that can prepare yourself for any macroeconomic environment not just a macroeconomic environment where you know growth is good and and inflation is falling i'm just curious if we look at that idea of low inflation and growth and and went back a lot further than last 40 years like what percentage of the time does that exist in history if we look at a much larger period yeah it's it's a good question i mean a uh a a simple example is you know you get um you you get significant inflation and deflation volatility something like 25 or 30% of the time when i say sign i mean like above 10% and below 0% um across the developed world if you look across the developed world across the last 100 years for all the major developed world economies it happens about 35% of the time right that you have either extreme inflation or extreme deflation i i think most people would be surprised that that was the case right and and those are pretty extreme scenarios above 10 and below zero are pretty extreme scenarios and ones in which the 60/40 portfolio in particular performs terribly in those sorts of environments and so pe basically people have gone all in on one set of conditions that exists you know with reasonable frequency uh you know something like i don't know maybe half the time uh that's that's a pretty good uh a pretty good portfolio given the macroeconomic conditions and have totally forgotten about the fact that you know inflation can be way too high or way too low growth can be in you know in a terrible state for an extended period of time um and that's when 6040 doesn't work so part of the idea here is to say we've gotten lucky um and recognize that we've gotten lucky and start to think about a wider range of different outcomes than just uh the ones in the last you know couple of decades
Trading Lessons Learned,2024-03-01 13:15:01+00:00,1,aAn5b0jDSC8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAn5b0jDSC8,another one to definitely highlight in terms of lessons learned is uh is thinking systematically you know i think all too often a lot of us have ideas you know intuitions about what's likely to transpire in marcus what how the world works etc and i think one of the challenges is there's really two challenges as an investor one is assessing whether your ideas are actually good and that's where systemization that idea of basically taking the idea and checking to see if back through time that was a good idea or not and whether that would a good way to trade markets or not through more sample size um is really beneficial and then the other thing that people often fail at when they're investing is that they're insufficiently disciplined and this isn't like a a moral judgment trading markets is super hard there's a lot of information coming out out at you at any point in time and it's frankly hard to process all that information in a way that's rigorous and so one of the things you can do is write down your rules
How to Think About an Economy,2024-02-29 13:15:04+00:00,2,Xw4Kf5CrLnU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw4Kf5CrLnU,we've had relatively recently what three of the like top five global economies slip into a technical recession so can you can you balance that strength with the fact that that we're seeing slowdowns in those countries and and to be specific i think it's what germany uk and japan are now all in technical recessions right well i i think when you're thinking about is a country in a recession or not like the whether gd real gdp growth is positive or negative doesn't matter like when you're thinking about an economy what you want to think about is how is how are economic conditions expanding relative to the underlying potential of the economy and so if you look at an economy like europe uh the potential growth of of the european economy is is already zero it's essentially zero or maybe even a little weaker productivity growth has been zero for many years labor force the labor force there is contracting and so zero growth in europe is actually a totally fine outcome given their overall all demographics and as a simple example if you look go look at the unemployment rate in europe it is actually at secular lows so while you know talking about recession in europe makes a lot of headlines it's not a particularly relevant uh thing to be thinking about or focusing on uh because the economy is growing about as well as it can given the underlying potential of it and the same is basically true in the uk japan's a little softer um and is a bit of an outlier across the development world but um but the but the basic picture that you have these economies that are mostly fine against expectations that we're going to have a sharp deceleration you know that that's the that's the basic picture and europe and the uk they've been growing basically at zero for two years
How Are Institutional Investors Thinking About A.I. Investment,2024-02-28 13:15:00+00:00,2,C3dJsdukHpM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3dJsdukHpM,hard to have a conversation about what's going on in in capital markets without at least mentioning ai as a as a driver of interest if we go down a level below into the fintech space what are you seeing as the impact for ai all of the companies that we're working with private and public view this as an arms race as it relates to ai we've spent a ton of time in ai over the course of the past six months uh we hired a new global head of ai investment banking uh who was chief strategy officer at data robot and so she's put us in front of a long list of of private ai companies we've also done a road show with sovereign wealth funds pensions and mutual funds just getting their perspective on the ai investing landscape uh what's interesting having done 15 of those meetings is the consensus feedback is great companies need to really understand the business plan and the economic model for each of them and so in the interim the best place to allocate capital to get exposure to ai without naming names is two or three of the biggest large caps and you can see it reflected in their stock prices from an m&a perspective i would say all of of the large corporates are trying to figure it out figure out how ai fits into their fundamental business plan what element of its disruptive what element of it accelerates their own road map um i think most will probably look to acquire as opposed to build organically i share paul's view it's a it's an arm race and when it's an arm race m&a tends to be the the natural answer to do it quickly where i think folks are struggling as they look at various opportunities through an m&a lens is what what's real ai versus what's what's a buzz in a powerpoint deck
Inflation and Interest Rates Will Dictate Future Investment,2024-02-27 13:15:01+00:00,2,apqvyyRle_0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apqvyyRle_0,whether or not inflation remains elevated uh or or ends up being elevated meaningfully relative to what we experienced is really a choice by the central bank the the question is not whether or not there will be inflation pressures as this plays out there will be inflation pressures that will emerge as a function of this the question is you know how much inflation is going to be taken versus how much is the fed and and the central bank going to uh and other central banks going to basically keep a lit on that inflation by keeping interest rates high and suppressing demand in that context and so you don't know which one it'll be so you kind of want to be positioned for both of them i think one of the key things that um you know it's a it's a particularly uh large flip from the era the era of zero interest rates and unlimited money supply that many businesses and investment strategies frankly have been built on so if you're a venture capitalist or private equity manager like it has been a great 15 years um but uh but it may well be quite a challenging next 15 um which we're just at the start of if you're riant on you know zero interest rates and unlimited liquidity in an environment where we have you know this amount of infrastructure rebuilding and elevated inflationary pressures
What's the U.S. Economic Outlook in Mid-Feb 2024?,2024-02-26 13:15:01+00:00,5,_FqzvuzSaHM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FqzvuzSaHM,and let's say at least the parts of 2024 and your that your headlights feel comfortable talking about here um what are you looking at right now um because it the vibe i got from you sort of earlier is feel pretty good in the near- term right so is it sort of game on for everything or are you worried at all about how far and how fast uh stocks have gone or or any other assets well i think one of the fun things about being a macro investor is you can pick the trades that you want to pick and not pick the and not trade the things you don't want to pick um and so and that's an important thing you don't have to trade every market you don't have to think about every market you just want to find the best opportunities and so i think coming into the year the best opportunity seemed relatively clear that we were probably not going to have seven cuts that were priced in to the us um and probably there was going to be pressure on bond yields to rise um and for stocks to outperform bonds now reality is in the last six weeks pricing has changed a lot uh just you know before we got on here i was looking at and now we have three cuts priced in for 24 not seven cuts priced in that's a heck of a move particularly in eight weeks that's a that's a heck of a move to have seen over that time frame and so now interest rate policy on the short end is kind of reasonable you may maybe there'll be less than three cuts because the econom is stronger and inflation is a little higher but like you know you don't want to pick trades that are you know the difference between three cuts and two cuts who cares no one has that level of precision right the difference is between seven and three and two right that's what you want to trade and so right now when i look across the overall financial markets you have a strong economy you have elevated inflation pressures you have a fed that probably is going to be a little more cautious than what many people had expected the place and i should add and you have large fiscal supply that's coming into the market that's going to pick up by 50% on a net issuance basis in the second quarter of the year and so the real question is why why are bonds you know can bonds continue to be priced in a way where where you know there's essentially a zero term premium on the long end of of the bond market given that set of macroeconomic conditions it seems unlikely we're going to see that and so yield curve steepening seems like one of the most compelling dynamics right now right now we have a we have an inverted uh yield curve and we still have an inverted yield curve and so seeing a shift to a steeper yield curve environment seems compelling given um you know what happen what's happening with the macroeconomy and also what's happening with the overall flows dynamic so that's really what i'd center on and i just want to make sure the viewers are following you here so when you talk about a steepening of the yield curve i i believe you're talking about the long end of the curve catching up to where short-term rates are right now versus the other way around right exactly exactly means that bond prices will come down sorry uh bond yeah prices bond prices will come down yields will go up that's exactly right is is that a lot of the tightening i mean essentially a lot of the tightening that we've seen so far has been really the short end dragging up the long end um rather than the long end reflecting the underlying strength in the economy the inflationary pressures in the bond supply and so you know that's the sort of thing that can continue for a period of time but it's almost like each day the recession doesn't come the long bond holders look at themselves and say oo this may not be the right trade here um i'm not sure i necessarily want to hold this much duration you know i i might not want to hold as bonds as i'm holding right now just as the supply of the bonds coming into the market is rising substantially and so that really looks like the the best opportunity um when i scan across the markets and look at all the different things now um most people don't care about trading yield curves uh or short rates they probably mostly care about equities um and what i'd say there is you know we've gotten a heck of a run of stocks in particular relative to their performance versus bonds we got a heck of a run on that and um and you know the economy is strong but you know it's going to be tough to meet the level of expectations uh particularly in earnings that exist in the market whether it's in the mag 7 but also you know s&p 493 is expected to have you know double digit higher double digit year-over-year earnings by the end of the fourth quarter it's going to be tough that's going to be tough
Are Trading Blocs The Future of 'Global' Trade?,2024-02-25 13:15:06+00:00,3,es1-Mc3AkHw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es1-Mc3AkHw,in your study of this so far do you what do you think is the likelihood that we will fragment into trading blocks where it'll be america i don't know who they are but i'm sure we'll still keep a lot of our atlantic uh alliances uh and maybe get even closer to latin and south america because that can be a a source of of younger workers for us uh and then have the rest of the world try to you know rotate around that seems to be the emerging bricks access yeah well i think um the story is probably a little different between the different uh the different major blocks when you look at uh the us the the um the obvious place to turn which has the combination of geograph geographic proximity um you know uh uh similar similar enough uh value structure and uh and corporate structure and strong um you know pretty well educated labor force growth is for the us to really turn first to mexico which of course we've done for 25 years but then also turn to the rest of latin america and i think that's really from the the us perspective i could easily see um a transition here from uh a nafta block to a western hemisphere block being the primary economic engine which is interesting because a lot of a lot of the talk with the bricks is like the intersection between say brazil and china and you know if anything it seems like this shift to uh a less integrated world is likely more likely to sort of break that rather than support that relationship given the geographic proximity as well as and i should emphasize the uh the capital flows dynamic as well and so that that also we we've talked a lot about trade and production and things like that that is also another re very important dynamic here because when you go through a period where you're going to have to rebuild so much infrastructure uh the places that are going to be able to do that most effectively are the places that have uh the deepest most effective capital markets right and access to capital and so um and you know we know uh you know the us has us and the us dollar is a huge liquid capital market with tons of skill in terms of allocating it particularly to emerging economies whereas other groups like china have proven um certainly to to struggle to some extent uh in doing that access to global or providing global capital in a way that is at least um economic in nature that've been proven to be able to do it in in a non-economic way um through belon road but not really in an economic way that over time is gonna is going to really pay the dividends the way that you know the western and particularly us capital markets have uh become very effective
Debating Between On-Shore vs Off-Shore Production,2024-02-24 13:15:01+00:00,3,Ki3s72IV3m4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki3s72IV3m4,it um in in some ways going to come down to what the policy framework is um that uh you know that's that's going to exist um for uh for the for the us in i think the us in particular but but other developed economies if you just take for instance something like putting 60% tariffs on china which is a proposed policy or at least a talked about policy from uh you know one of the presidential candidates that type of magnitude of of tariff policy essentially totally changes the economics of onshore versus offshore production um or nearshore versus you know far offshore production and so you could you know if you go back to the chart i was showing before we we went from a period of time where something like 15% of gdp was in some sort of tradable structure in one form or another to about you know 30 35% um there's no reason why we couldn't go back to 15% let's say something back to sort of the average you know pre pre post world war ii uh in an isolationist environment i'm not saying that necessarily that that's a certainty that we're going to go there just saying if you're thinking about what this could look like in a sort of let's call it a maxi isolationist environment um you could get to something that looks in that order of magnitude particularly on a blocks perspective so maybe not usa in particular but like us canada mexico as a block or or western hemisphere as a block um you know that would mean moving 15% of gdp essentially of you know global activity um basically duplicating something like you know 15% of gdp of global activity in one form or another you know if that happens over the course of 10 or 20 years even 10 or 20 years would be a meaningful impact on economic conditions for uh the investor the people building the capacity and would be a meaningful detriment in terms of no new capacity build for uh for the for the folks who are uh who are feeling the the pain from uh the unwind of the globalization trend so you know that that's a dynamic that could be meaningfully supportive to uh a us economy and i should say it it happens in an environment where we're also having these demographic challenges uh and so you have low lower or falling supply of labor need to re to re door need to build parallel infrastructure that combination of things is kind of is pretty challenging when it comes to thinking about how are we going to move and build and plus the skill loss that's happened over the last four years in terms of literally doing it like putting that all together is a pretty challenging task if we're going to really decouple from each other
What's the Surpring Effect of Nationalism on the Economy?,2024-02-23 13:15:03+00:00,3,z5gLhI4B2-8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5gLhI4B2-8,well i i think for um for a lot of folks you know the the impact of this shift from essentially optimized production across the world to parallel production across the world um has uh will will in many ways sort of very clearly have that inflation effect but what i'd emphasize is um is that the the sort of medium-term short to medium-term effect of that um is actually growth p positive uh which is very interesting and it's globally growth positive because essentially what we're going to do over the course of the next five or 10 years is in each one of these different economic blocks create parallel infrastructure production and services infrastructure that didn't previously exist and so if you think about it you know the t-shirt manufacturing that once was basically in the us then went abroad to southeast asia you know now gets replicated maybe it's not not in the us maybe or maybe it's in lower income areas of the us or in mexico or in the rest of latin america but that's just that building that infrastructure requires investment that investment is a positive impulse on overall demand which is actually in the in the short term a bigger impact on uh the inflationary dynamics than actually the shift in the in the goods production because what it what it does the the the actual um investment is a has a lever effect on economic activity and happens today not over the course of the whole productive capacity and so that's like in the us context in particular what we're seeing is things like the chips sack and infrastructure and stuff like that which are directly responsive to this dynamic creating a lot of of strength um that would have otherwise not occurred so i think that's that's really the first stage and particularly important in the context of these economies that have had an inflation problem recently and are already operating at you know late cycle relatively tight environments
Has Global Trade Reached its Peak?,2024-02-22 13:15:07+00:00,5,whEqseJbgGs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whEqseJbgGs,so um to to the main question here so this this question about um peak globalization and and maybe is it already in our rearview mirror um i noticed this initially in in a tweet that you put out on twitter or x or whatever it's called now um uh and maybe if you can just give a little backstory to the data set that you were looking at there um we we have had periods in the past where we've shifted from a a more globalized uh economy to a less one um and uh so it's not like this has never happened but certainly globalization's been a a really big trend for most living people i mean most folks watching this video that's kind of all they've known has been increasing globalization if that trend is is truly starting to plateau and perhaps start reversing what implications is that going to have well i think let me uh let me pull up uh let me pull up the chart if you'll uh if you'll bear with me uh because i think it's it's a good chart can you see this yep you know i think it's a great this was great context over you know a 200-year time frame like what have we experienced most of us uh and and what the chart is is um is the amount of trade uh that uh that has occurred you know as a percent of the global economy and so um you know measured as total imports as a percent of gdp uh reflected by uh you know adding up all the countries based upon their population right so take all the countries a population weight them uh imported imports as a percent of gdp and what you see here is uh relative to history we've got one of the biggest you know basically the most global trade we've ever had in uh in the last 150 years which you know is not that surprising in particular since we've brought on uh over the course of the last you know 50 years uh a huge number of different um different economies into the global mix first you know japan and asia and then ch china coming after that and so most basically everyone alive today only knows this post-war surge in global production integration that you see you know starting in 1945 and basically rising until um until the financial crisis and really just after all the way to covid and that's a really important dyam amic um but it is you because it what it did is it increased a lot of efficiency it was a downward pressure on prices it was a significant pressure on uh the middle class of particularly the expensive developed world in terms of their wages um and and basically just created a ton of efficiency in the economy i mean today like maybe not today but if you go back five or 10 years basically every good and and and almost every service was basically uh either built or done in the most efficient place in the world where the you know productivity adjusted cost of that labor to get that service or good done was you know the lowest possible cost everywhere and that you know that getting to a peak in that and then possibly reversing that creates a radically different uh dynamic than basically anyone's experience but it's not that unusual in sort of a a global economy sort of sense to have these sorts of es and flows you know from the postor war i through world war ii environment you know a lot of isolationism a big drop um you know you had the the uk dynamic you know when the uk became the global leader you had a big expansion in global trade and as they trailed off that also faded so it's not like these things are certain i think many of us sort of take for granted that uh you know trade globalization is the reality forever and it's definitely not necessarily the case
What's Driving the Rise in Consumer Debt,2024-02-21 13:15:04+00:00,5,hCVVR_0sFiY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCVVR_0sFiY,so help help help our viewers understand that because um you know we've had we have a lot of experts on this this program and they have all sorts of different opinions i would say if i had to sort of create a consensus i i would say that a lot of them are kind of concerned actually about consumer households and yes it's good that wage growth has picked up and and that is helping like i said there a lot of households still feel like it's got a ways to go before they really feel like they've healed from this cost of living shock that that they took on um but we've seen things like um you know tremendous growth in uh or or let's say rapid growth in um uh household uh uh debt especially revolving uh credit um that's happening at a time where that credit is is charging record rates um we're seeing you know an explosion of participation in payment schemes like buy now pay later and whatnot um a lot of people take these signs as signs that the consumer household is like increasingly you know starting to struggle right um and we just saw the um the retail sales numbers uh for january just came out and i think it was the the biggest year-over-year decline that we've seen in retail sales since like the early part of 2020 when we were shutting down the global economy and that's just one month that's not necessarily a trend yet but people can certainly look at some of these data points and say i don't know it seems to me like the consumer is really beginning uh to get weak um and when you look at consumer sentiment yeah it's improving but it's improving off a pretty low levels um when you say the consumer household is strong what what particular metrics are you looking at well i i think it's it's important in this sort of circumstance um to make sure that you're looking at a holistic picture of what's going on uh rather than trying to pick particular pieces of information there's always in any macroeconomic environment there's always a lot of crosscutting information in the past if you go you know over the past 20 years it's been valuable to try and pick out the things that look like they're leading because there is that self-reinforcing dynamic but in an environment where um you know the postco environment has created a lot of noise across a lot of different things plus elevated inflationary environment means that you can get uh you can get distracted by certain things when you're trying to pick out pieces rather than look at the whole so like just responsive to the couple things that you brought up uh consumer credit has risen as a percent depo disposable income um it remains you know at roughly the same levels as it was preco um consumer credit of course is expanded in nominal terms because uh consumer credit is predominantly revolving credit card uh debt that credit card debt the vast majority in dollar terms is paid off on a monthly basis by the borrowers of the on the credit cards and so what you're seeing is you're seeing nominal spending rising because inflation is r ron which means that the debts on revolving credit inevitably have to rise because uh the overall level of spending and charges on the accounts are rising and so that's why you need to look at it relative to disposable income secondly if you look at buy now pay later a lot of people get focused on that just for context buy now pay later the amount of borrowing the impact on gdp is equivalent to the gdp of sagong sagen who cares about sagen probably you know 99% of the people watching this video probably can't even pick out saga on a map right i come from detroit so i know where saga is but like that's what we're talking about like who spends their time talking about sago right but that is the reality of what people are doing when they start to talk about buy now pay later right that's how big that is it added like tenths like tiny you know basis points on the gdp because it is so small but yet people are talking about it because it's a shiny thing that looks bad rather than quantifying it and that's why it's so important you have have to quantify these points it's not oh there's some stress in one corner some stress in another therefore the whole system is going to come down what's going on with the vast majority of households with secularly low unemployment their incomes are growing at 5% nominally they um they have bought houses that they financed at at between two and 3% those house prices up 40% and their stocks are surging making their 401ks as you know as good a shape as they've been in a long time like that's what's going on and the result is that these households are spending their nominal incomes and creating real spending power um and so you know that that's that's the aggregate picture that's the picture for the median household
What Makes a Good Trader?,2024-02-20 13:15:03+00:00,1,K6XIod65Nao,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6XIod65Nao,good being a good trader is to have a game plan a game plan that you think over time will deliver edge relative to relative to passive investing and so the way that you can get the best out of your game plan the best out of your edge is by being systematic and disciplined about your edge and trying your best as much as you possibly can to not have you know the emotions of the day or the information of the day necessarily knock you off of what your game plan is because when you have that you're likely to succeed over time and i know i know it's hard this is not this is not to say oh we you know every person it's just so easy right you just create a system and and you do it i mean i've been doing this for 20 years and i still feel that tension that tension that that that emotional tension of whether or not the incremental information i'm seeing is should change my mind should take me off of my game plan but i promise you over time it will lead to better outcomes the more disciplined you are
How Government Policy Might Affect Markets,2024-02-19 13:15:03+00:00,4,zcZWsUHlB1Y,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcZWsUHlB1Y,and and really as a as a macroeconomist really looking at what what does what are the macroeconomic implications of that set of conditions um the increase in uh in immigration has had a significant impact in loosening the labor market conditions of particularly lower income cohorts and that has been an important aspect of bringing down wages and bringing down bring down wages in those groups and bringing down prices overall nominal spending overall and so um you you have a set of conditions here where uh where you have two policy makers that are you know certainly i think pursuing meaningfully different approaches on this question which is um you know one which is pursuing a basically a closed border system um and possibly deportation of currently unauthorized workers and another that i think it you know on the margin is tightening up up as you know um but isn't necessarily nearly as um not anywhere close to as uh uh tight in terms of border uh controls and so i think that's a real interesting that's probably you know that maybe the chinese tariffs are probably some of the the perspective chinese tariffs are probably some of the most interesting policy divergences between the two parties and i think we're going to start you know we're going to start to see some implications of those policy merces probably start to affect markets you know now i think it's it's interesting you it's certainly notable that the uh weakness in china while you know primarily domestically driven but the weakness particularly an external demand for chinese assets foreign demand for chinese assets has coincided with conversations about how uh uh from trump about you know his 60% tariff and things like that that's certainly something that if the odds become clearer in one direction or the other that's probably going to start to affect markets pretty quickly okay and you're saying the main effect is because we don't have a growing labor force since covid uh you know people have been uh you know re unable to unable to find workers and uh and fairly unwilling to let them go uh although some tech companies have made cuts so uh when it comes to inflation uh the wage price spiral is real important part of it and you you say that if we start mass deportation who's going to take the jobs we're g that's right i mean it's just you just think about it as you know just like there's supply and demand in any market um labor is just a fun you know labor prices which is really wages right wage growth and wages are are essentially the clearing price for labor um and so if you you know remove a supply side part of the reason why we've had actually pretty good we've been able to bring inflation down is because we've actually had a big increase in labor force participation in the last couple of years that's essentially supply side right um and you know without it unemployment rate would be moving you know into the low threes even the high twos without that labor force participation level being at all-time highs and so if we remove a significant chunk of labor that could easily create um you know uh insufficient uh labor supply for certain sectors of the economy particularly lower income cohorts and and you know companies will have to bid bid more to get the incremental worker that's just how it you know it's it's no different than any other market and supply and demand
Might Today's Current Commercial Real Estate Market be like the GFC?,2024-02-18 13:15:02+00:00,4,LbQ8coJ4n7c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQ8coJ4n7c,earlier the first is basically what are you what are your thoughts on the emerging credit issues uh coming into the uh into the cr sector obviously gotten a lot of attention with new york community bank over the course of the last week um new york community bank is uh concerns or issues is a highly idiosyncratic situation one that i wouldn't draw a lot of parallels to i i think a lot of folks are uh just assuming uh are drawing a connection between the current cr problem in particularly office cr problems and the types of conditions that we saw uh during the global financial crisis and i would emphasize that there is a big a radical difference between those two environments and the reason why that is is first uh cr is on balance sheet lending on balance sheet lending takes time to be recognized those losses those delinquencies and losses take time to be recognized those losses only only get recognized once there's non-payment and can be extended modified adjusted there's lots of different things bank can banks can do to push out the losses uh over time uh number two is the nature the economic exposure that the banks have and the risk that they have um is uh because it's in loans doesn't have to be marked to market nearly as quickly as what we saw in the global financial crisis the global financial crisis those are securities holdings those securities holdings had to be mark to market relatively close to fair value relatively quickly and so you have a situation with c that's likely to play out over 10 years let's say and even if you had double financial cr crisis losses in c relative to the acute crisis that happened with residential real estate securities that would be a totally different dynamic for for the banks today because it would give them years of earning power and in fact if what you did is you went through and you assumed that the cr losses the total c losses um for these banks were double what they were in the depression which would be ext an extraordinarily loss rate and you gave them five years to recognize them they would earn for the small banks they would earn more nim more incremental nim even if their nim was cut by 50% then would be the total loss rate across all of those loans that they have on their books so and so what it means is you could have extraordinary losses as long as the banks can push off the the losses into history earn nim even depressed nim they can absorb it without even going into their already relatively elevated regulatory capital and so uh the thought you know i think a lot of people are looking around and saying let me find the next crisis and the next crisis it will not come from cra uh and take that from a person who called the financial crisis right and also cause called the svb circumstance uh not derailing the economy right right they're two totally different circumstances two totally different times
U.S. Treasury Issuance Continues and Increases,2024-02-17 13:15:01+00:00,5,W1Mc_ZlFLPw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1Mc_ZlFLPw,important to understanding what the forward path of monetary policy will be at least here for the first half of 2024 and so what we see here uh first is the treasury uh the treasury issuance information that we received uh at the beginning of and what we found you know what what has been the case for a while you can see over here on the leftand side uh there's been a considerable amount of duration supply uh that was accelerated in the first quarter uh and has picked up over the course of the last year uh and that gross supply uh here um uh reported normalizing across different teners for the overall interest rate risk um is basically at highs uh of uh the last couple of years and only was higher during periods of time where uh where we had you know the 2020 significant funding uh of uh of of uh of issuance and build of the tga and so a lot of bond issuance is still coming that's because there are large deficits and because the treasury while choosing to issue a fair amount of bills on a on a long-term basis is committed to continuing to issue meaningful amounts of duration in this case making a clear commentary that they've the step up in duration issuance is what they expect to be the case for an extended period period of time and so the result we see here is that that duration issuance has picked up meaningfully which is creating uh you know will continue to be a significant supply factor in the bond market and overall asset markets and so just to nail those numbers down if we look here on the right hand side what you see in uh for the second quarter this is all second quarter expected issuance is that second quar expected issuance is expected to be quite strong on a gross basis 1100 or 1.1 trillion in bond issuance but probably even more important is on the the net of duration issuance the net of coupon issuance which is expected to be about 520 billion dollar over the course of a single quarter of coupon issuance uh that's pretty much set that won't change it's possible this bills number may change if the deficit number which looked a little low in terms of the projections uh ends up coming in to be larger than expected the treasury will adjust with the bills side of things um but the coupon issuance is going to come and coupon issuance of 500 billion dollars or so uh over the course of the quarter is roughly double of what the coupon issuance is that we saw in the first quarter of this year and is very high relative to history and so that duration supply is going to keep hitting the market and keep hitting the market now you can see from the mix of duration supply that the treasury is really focused on trying to keep it in the belly of the curve rather than out the curve where uh you know it may be harder for them to get the demand that they're looking for um but still this is going to require a fair you know this is this is the type of flow the type of issuance that is way beyond what anyone can front run it's going to be day after day after day these huge issuances and unless there's a meaningful shift in economic conditions to shift the valuation uh profile of bonds i think we've got it's going to be hard to absorb all of these issuances so i wouldn't read too much into that uh that auction that occurred uh yesterday that went off pretty well one auction um which is still not in the period where there's been ele where there's going to be elevated issuance which in the second quarter not the first order so i wouldn't you know i' i'd be careful to extrapolate better financing conditions or okay financing conditions for the treasury today to assume that that will continue out for the first half of the year
Fed Rate Cut Expectations Continue to be Pushed Out,2024-02-16 13:15:03+00:00,2,ozFdnNOPi-Y,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozFdnNOPi-Y,on the fed side of things i think we also got an interesting picture where many folks in fact it was almost at 80% uh were expecting a cut in march and where jerome powell in the press conference as well as subsequent to that in his 60 minutes interview really pushed back on the idea that there was going to be a quick shift to easing by the fed over the course of uh the first half at least of 2024 i if anything uh you know the mo probably the most interesting thing about this that 60-minute segment was drum was the voiceover from scott p who said that cuts probably wouldn't come until the summer which was quite different than what was priced in uh and so you can see how the pricing over the course of the last month has really unwound the expectations of a cut this is on the left- hand side of a cut in uh march that's down to 16 16 or 17% this morning um down from roughly 80% uh to kick off the year uh and where expectations of the fed holding have increased further you can see on the table on the right hand side we now have a near 40% chance that the fed is going to hold not just in march but also uh in may and so that's starting to unwind but it's being met with expectations of uh you know some continued cut through the back half of the year and we still have you know 100 uh somewhere roughly fiveish cuts expected over the course of the year that's come down from seven uh roughly seven at at its peak but it's still at five cuts given the uh mix of macroeconomic conditions that we're seeing is still a question about whether that's going to um whether that's going to occur and so
U.S. Economy: Stronger for Longer Seemingly Confirmed,2024-02-15 13:15:05+00:00,4,scRCmivFy5Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scRCmivFy5Q,think one of the more interesting things is we've got a lot of confirmatory evidence here over the course of the last month of the stronger for longer environment confirmatory evidence that the treasury will um continue to bring significant duration supply into the market and increase that in quarter two and that the fed is unlikely to be nearly as easy uh as uh as markets uh market participants had expected coming into the year and yet when you put the mix of things together we really haven't had that big an adjustment in asset market pricing to reflect that that reality that confirm sort of confirmatory reality and so um certainly markets have moved and they moved uh you know a fair amount from the the start of the year uh over here on the lefthand side i have stocks uh minus long duration bonds uh that's moved actually that that trade has moved almost 20% % uh in the favor of stocks relative to long-term bonds uh and it was a trade that was highlighted right uh right to kick off the year uh in our uh in our note in our in our 2024 outlook as well as highlighted in our previous uh webinar to kick off the year so that's moved a fair amount but at a big picture level we're still looking at stock prices relative to bond prices that are roughly where they were last fall and so we've retraced the draw down uh which didn't which was looked inconsistent with the macroeconomic data that we're seeing but we haven't gone meaningfully above where we were in october and remember since october we've had you know almost 100 basis points decline in bond yields and stock prices up 20% all of which and an economy that continues to roar along you put that all together and what do you see is you see a circumstance where there's probably more room to run on the stock versus bond trade uh that has uh that has done well this year and then on the right hand side of course we've got what cuts are priced in to 2024 which we continue to see about 120 125 basis points of cuts priced into 2024 five cuts you know which is certainly possible um but if you think about the macroeconomic reality of this level of strong growth and continued uh lingering concerns about inflation what you'd have to expect and plus the fed that's kind of that's made it somewhat clear that aren't going to be coming till the summer unless something meaningfully changes what you basically see in this uh in this mix of things is that um you know you're basically pricing in a a cut every meeting starting in the summer and you know that's certainly possible but given uh given what we're seeing in the data and given frankly what the what the various members are saying it still seems overstated to expect five cuts in the market today so these these two trades you know which i think are the are the two stronger for the two most obvious stronger for longer trades have been in the money since the start of the year and look as though they have more room to run given what we're seeing
Chinese Equity Market Interventions,2024-02-14 13:15:00+00:00,4,1TlC9iz7nys,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TlC9iz7nys,chinese equities because china the state the government has been coming in buying stocks uh and she is promising more of it and you talk about interventions uh you talked about it in currency markets um here's an intervention in equity markets so do you view this as uh and you say fade interventions fade interventions that's right so so i'm assuming with uh china intervening in equities that uh you would say this is a great chance to get out if you were long and got and took some heavy losses and if you're a speculator you'd be looking to get short china that the lows are not in like a lot of people believe yeah i think yeah i think look central banks often intervene in prices um either exchange rates or stock markets and when they in intervene in the market price but don't change the underlying fundamental policy they are all they're doing is just providing exit liquidity for private sector pressures which are moving in the opposite direction and i this chart i i actually i really like this chart because if you just look if you were to overlay a set of policy measures over the course of the last nine months what you'd see is each one of these pops that you see through this chart each one had a policy story narrative that was like this is the thing that's going to create the turn but like where's the turn where is the turn the turn isn't there and the reason why that is is because they're do they're what they're doing is they're trying to intervene in the stock market rather than do what's necessary from a fundamental perspective which is look china is experiencing like uh deflationary you know a deflationary not not really quite deleveraging but just kind of a inflationary um you know sucking no consumer demand for things right was what they wanted to shift to being more of a domestically supported economy than an export driven economy that's right that's right and so they haven't but the reason why they haven't had that shift is not because it's an impossibility it it's very easy to stimulate domestic demand heck we we certainly have seen it in the us you know we know how to there's there's a they're gonna do that maybe the helicopters come out in china and maybe the helicopters come out in china but until that monetary policy changes okay which would change the fundamental conditions simply intervening in the asset market isn't going to be enough they have to change the underlying fundamental monetary policy and they just for whatever reason and and the politics of china are you know above my pay grade they are not doing they're not providing the level of monetary stimulation necessary to create an economic acceleration or an improvement in their markets
Benefits of Systemization,2024-02-13 13:15:01+00:00,3,mtUHs2-rOqQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtUHs2-rOqQ,thing about systematic investing is um if you have an edge which you know i think people who really work hard at this can develop edge in the markets then what you want to do if you have edge is you want to bet that edge as much as you possibly can and as consistently as you possibly can right you want you want your swing to be the best swing you've got and part of the benefit of systemization is it allows you to go do that more often meaning across markets and also more consistently because i'm sure you i mean you've been in this business long enough so it's automated when you talk uh okay instead of because you know we wake up sometimes you i have migraines and uh i am a discretionary trader right and i trade better when i feel better but if you have a yeah you know but if you have a system something mechanical that uh automatically executes your ideas you don't have to feel it being in your peak performing state that that's right that's right and i mean you certainly know probably uh as well as anyone that uh part of trading markets is a head game uh it's not just it's not just you know understanding the markets well reading the charts well reading the data well it's about having the discipline and and the and the head game to be able to execute on it uh as effectively as possible and in a lot of ways systemization it's just it's just a way to do that more effectively than um trying to keep it in your head all in your head and so lots of things you can do incrementally along the path of systemization to help improve your ability to trade and execute um as effectively as possible so you know don't don't think that you have to build some grand thing to be able to get edge and help with your discipline through trying to you know build out write down your decision rules go back to them you know uhm and codm kodum exactly
Unlimited Macroeconomic Webinar February 2024,2024-02-12 13:15:00+00:00,52,13g74JKxLuE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13g74JKxLuE,[music] um you take a step back in this current economic environment we've seen basically six quarters of uh at or above potential us economic growth and i think that's really important um because what it highlights is despite the fact that there's been an elevated rate environment for the majority of that exp experience growth continues to be relatively strong in the united in the united states and sufficiently strong to keep the economy uh tight to keep labor markets tight and to keep incomes continuing to grow sufficiently to keep nominal spending elevated and so at its core what we see here is if anything an acceleration a bit in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year year which is notable in the context of the fact that interest rates have been at these levels for an for by now an extended period of time if if you run through this scenario basically what's going on here you can see on the lefthand chart is the quarterly gdp numbers uh which you know we had a 3.3% print for 4 q23 on the right hand side some more timely numbers where you see that demand particularly uh has remained pretty strong and was very strong in december we see employment continues to be very strong across the economy so on the leftand side is payroll growth which remained quite strong uh through the course of 2023 and if anything showed a touch of acceleration into the back end of the year the unemployment rate there at 3.7 at secular lows uh continues to be at secular lows and has been basically in this range for 18 months and on top of it when we look at more timely indications of employment whether it's initial or continuing claims they all point to uh at least through january a continuation of this relatively strong employment circumstance it's also important to recognize that it's not just demand and employment some of the most cyclically sensitive parts of the economy are starting to improve inside we see michigan consumer sentiment which is which is at highs uh of the last two years um and we see on the right hand side uh a sense of what's going on with homes lots of different ways to measure it but we have seen an improvement in housing activity purchases uh sentiment a wide range of different measures uh related to housing all of which point to some if anything a bit of acceleration here to start off 2024 so you put that all together and and what do we see we basically see a circumstance where there's been six quarters of above potential at or above potential gdp growth that growth is broad-based it's across many sectors of the economy demand manufacturing housing uh employment uh investment uh government spending all of it is pretty strong uh we don't you know there aren't that many sectors of the economy at this point that are causing a meaningful drag on economic activity and the early measures that we see for early uh 2024 is that that growth will continue uh to is continuing through uh the early part of the first quarter here we have the atlanta fed gdp now estimate which of course early in the quarter is you know is subject to meaningful shifts but that early data which again gives indication on suggests that we're running uh you know just a touch weaker than where we were in the previous quarter but still well above potential and well above analysts expectations or blue chip consensus economist expectations of gdp growth for the first quarter which are still below 1.5% and this continued strength in the economy has uh has uh surprised uh basically not just at the sort of aggregate level on the left hand side but also at the individual stat level where what you're seeing is an acceleration and improvement in economic surprises that have really uh taken off here in the first half uh the first part uh of january releases and so when you look at this overall picture relative to what we talked about last month with in the context or the framing of stronger for longer growth in the united states this is basically playing out as you'd expect if anything the relatively significant market-based easing that occurred at the end of last year with a significant decline in interest rates as well as the rise in stock markets uh which was on a two-month basis the largest financial market easing that we had seen in the last 40 years you would have expected that to start to translate into strengthening or continued strong economic conditions in the united states and that's exactly what we've been seeing with the early data releases here in early 2024 so you've got a strong economy running above potential uh and one that is strong enough to keep the labor markets tight at the same time we've seen uh uh continued reports of uh relatively subdued inflation uh a lot of focus on the pce numbers which you see over there on the left hand side particularly the core pce numbers which have been very soft over the course of the last couple of months uh those those numbers are uh are certainly a key area that the fed focuses on and and the consistency over the last six months with which those numbers have basically been roughly at the fed's mandate at 2% um is certainly uh certainly a good thing from the fed's perspective uh of course it's important to recognize that a large portion of that driver large driver of that has been a significant weakness in goods prices which are contracting in price relatively rapidly and on par with the big disinflationary environments of the earlier 2000s uh and as drum powell mentioned it's not clear that we should necessarily rely on that goods disinflation to persist out in uh into the future and so there is some concern that we might have uh later in the year a rise in this inflation measure uh as a result of goods disinflation moderating when we have services inflation that continues to be relatively elevated but but overall from a big picture perspective from the from the fed's view of things uh we've got a pretty benign inflationary environment and on the right hand side important recognize there are some differences and and not to get too focused literally on the core pce number although it's uh there's a reason why the fed says it's the preferred measure not the only measure and what you see with cpi is that it's come in just a bit stronger than what we've seen in the pce side of things and as the fed mentioned uh in the press conference last week the uh it'll be particularly important to take a look at what's going on with the revisions which come out tomorrow to see whether uh they can increase their confidence that this disinflationary dynamic has occurred and so where we are today with this strong growth modest inflation uh still some concerns about whether you know modest inflation that is roughly at the fed's mandate with some concerns that uh it may not be able to stay there for an extended period of time that's basically the suite of information we've gathered over the course of the last month consistent with the stronger for longer narrative and and thesis um and you know incrementally you know not not too much information other than a continuation of the trends that we've been seeing the other concern that has continued to exist from the fed's perspective is on the wage side of things where wages uh which of course translate into services pricing as well as well as nominal spending continue to be a bit high relative to where the fed would like them to uh believe that cpi was moving down durably to their inflation mandate and so you see the eci which was sort of cheered as coming down in the most recent report but is still elevated relative to where we were preco average hourly earnings which came in uh a bit hot partially due to technical reasons but overall forget the technical reasons and it popped a little bit there in january just look at that chart over the course of the last you know two years i certainly wouldn't say that there's an obvious downtrend that's going on in average hourly earnings as you look at it there and then of course we have the atlanta fed uh wage tracker which the most recent print yesterday was a bit softer although it came on the heels of a monthly print that was a bit stronger uh the month before so i wouldn't probably read too much into it still running at about 5% on a reasonable moving average basis uh year-over-year wage growth which is still a couple of points elevated relative to where we were uh preco and so that that's really the underlying concern is that even though we've had measured inflation reports over the last couple of months that have contin that have been at roughly at the fed's mandate and i i emphasize at the fed's mandate not meaningfully below not radically below this is roughly at the fed's mandate uh these wage pressures continue to be a concern for the fed about whether or not more structurally we're in an environment where inflation has meaningfully and and durably dropped to the fed's mandate so if we look over the past month we also received a fair amount of incremental information uh as far as policy so the the macroeconomic data circumstance basically looks the same uh as where we were to kick off the year uh but we have had a fair amount of incremental policy news and uh we talked about last month about how there was a a honestly a great deal of uncertainty about how exactly both the treasury and the fed would respond to the economic conditions as well as other pressures in the setting of their policy and so that clarity that we've achieved over the course of the last uh 10 days or so has been critically important to understanding what the four path of monetary policy will be at least here for the first half of 2024 and so what we see here uh first is the treasury uh the treasury issuance information that we received uh at the beginning of and what we found you know what what has been the case for a while you can see over here on the leftand side uh there's been a considerable amount of duration supply uh that was accelerating in the first quarter uh and has picked up over the course of the last year uh and that gross supply uh here um uh report normalizing across different teners for the overall interest rate risk um is basically at highs uh of uh the last couple of years and only was higher during periods of time where uh where we had you know the 2020 significant funding uh of uh of uh of issuance and bill of the tga and so a lot of bond issuance is still coming that's because there are large deficits and because the treasury while choosing to issue a fair amount of bills on a on a long-term basis is committed to continuing to issue meaningful amounts of duration in this case making a clear commentary that they've the step up in duration issuance is what they expect to be the case for an extended period of time and so the result we see here is that that duration issuance has picked up meaningfully which is creating uh you know will continue to be a significant supply factor in the bond market and overall asset markets and so just to nail those numbers down if we look here on the right hand side what you see in uh for the second quarter this is all second quarter expected issuance is that second quarter expected issuance is expected to be quite strong on a gross basis 1100 or 1.1 trillion in bond issuance but probably even more important is on the the net of duration issuance the net of coupon issuance which is expected to be about 520 billion dollars over the course of a single quarter of coupon issuance uh that's pretty much set that won't change it's possible this bills number may change if the deficit number which looked a little low in terms of the projections uh ends up coming in to be larger than expected the treasury will adjust with the bills side of things um but the coupon issuance is going to come and coupon issuance of 500 billion dollars or so uh over the course of the quarter is roughly double of what the coupon issuance is that we saw in the first quarter of this year and is very high relative to history and so that duration supply is going to keep hitting the market and keep hitting the market now you can see from the mix of duration supply that the treasury is really focused on trying to keep it in the belly of the curve rather than out the curve where uh you know it may be harder for them to get the demand that they're looking for um but still this is going to require a fair you know this is this is the type of flow the type of issuance that is way beyond what anyone can front run it's going to be day after day after day these huge issuances and unless there's a meaningful shift in economic conditions to shift the valuation uh profile of bonds i think we've got it's going to be hard to absorb all of these issuances so i wouldn't read too much into that uh that auction that occurred uh yesterday that went off pretty well one auction um which is still not in the period where there's been ele where there's going to be elevated issuance which in the second quarter not the first quarter so i wouldn't you know i'd be careful to extrapolate better financing conditions or okay financing conditions for the treasury today to assume that that will continue out for the first half of the year so a lot of duration supply and certainly if we um if we look at uh or compare to a a variety of different theories that the treasury was going to act solely politically and issue a bunch of bills during this time that obviously didn't happen um you know the technocrats to some extent won uh the mix is nudged to bills but at a big picture level there are large deficits and there's large coupon issuance coming and that will be a weight across all asset prices and particularly treasuries on the fed side of things i think we also got an interesting picture where many folks in fact it was almost at 80% uh were expecting a cut in march and where jerome powell in the press conference as well as subsequent to that in his 60 minutes interview really pushed back on the idea that there was going to be a quick shift to easing by the fed over the course of uh the first half at least of 2024 i if anything uh you know the mo probably the most interesting thing about this that 60- minute segment was drome was the voiceover from scott p who said that cuts probably wouldn't come until the summer which was quite different than what was priced in uh and so you can see how the pricing over the course of the last month has really unwound the expectations of a cut this is on the lefthand side of a cut in uh march that's down to 16 16 or 17% this morning um down from roughly 80% uh to kick off the year uh and where expectations of the fed holding have increased further you can see on the table on the right hand side we now have a near 40% chance that the fed is going to hold not just in march but also uh in may and so that's starting to unwind but it's being met with expectations of uh you know some continued cuts through the back half of the year and we still have you know 100 uh somewhere roughly fiveish cuts expected over the course of the year that's come down from seven uh roughly seven at at its peak but it's still at five cuts given the a mix of macroeconomic conditions that we're seeing is still a question about whether that's going to um whether that's going to occur and so i think one of the more interesting things is we've got a lot of confirmatory evidence here uh over the course of the last month of the stronger for longer environment confirmatory evidence that the treasury will um continue to bring significant duration supply into the market and increase that in quarter two and that the fed is likely to be nearly as easy uh as uh as markets uh market participants had expected coming into the year and yet when you put the mix of things together we really haven't had that big an adjustment in asset market pricing to reflect that that reality that confirmed sort of confirmatory reality and so um certainly markets have moved and they moved uh you know a fair amount from the the start of the year over here on the leth hand side i have stocks uh minus long duration bonds that's moved actually that that trade has moved almost 20% uh in the favor of stocks relative to long-term bonds uh and it was a trade that was highlighted right uh right to kickoff the year uh in our uh in our note in our in our 2024 outlook as well as highlighted in our previous uh webinar to kick off the year so that's moved a fair amount but at a big picture we're still looking at stock prices relative to bond prices that are roughly where they were last fall and so we've retraced the draw down uh which didn't which was looked inconsistent with the macroeconomic data that we're seeing but we haven't gone meaningfully above where we were in october and remember since october we've had you know almost 100 basis points decline in bond yields and stock prices up 20% all of which and an economy that continues to roar along you put that all together together and what do you see is you see a circumstance where there's probably more room to run on the stock versus bond trade uh that has uh that has done well this year and then on the right hand side of course we've got what cuts are priced in to 2024 which we continue to see about 120 125 basis points of cuts priced into 2024 five cuts you know which is certainly possible um but if you think about the macroeconomic reality of this level of strong growth and continued uh lingering concerns about inflation what you'd have to expect and plus the fed that's kind of that's made it somewhat clear that cuts aren't going to be coming till the summer unless something meaningfully changes what you basically see in this uh in this mix of things is that um you know you're basically pricing in a a cut every meeting starting in the summer and you know that's certainly possible but given uh given what we're seeing in the data and given frankly what the what the various members are saying it still seems overstated to expect five cuts in the market today so these these two trades you know which i think are the are the two stronger for the two most obvious stronger for longer trades uh have been in the money since the start of the year and look as though they have more room to run given what we're seeing that's the basic story in the us i think if look more broadly across uh across the world entering 2024 there's there was an expectation not just of cuts in the united states significant cuts in the united states but significant cuts globally uh across nearly all of the major developed central banks the ecb the boe the rba and the bank of canada all expected to cut more than a 100 basis points you know almost 150 basis points coming into the year something we highlighted uh a little while ago uh in in our in our 24 outlook and i think a big reason why that's expected is because these economies are expected to meaningfully decelerate as a function of the tight monetary policy that's been in place for a while i think again going to the data and looking at what we're seeing coming out of the reporting from those various economies what it looks like is that the deceleration that has that is expected by many market participants particularly bond market pricing um and is necessary to start to create a relatively swift shift to easing has largely not materialized here in the opening part of the year and so you see well let's we can start with europe which i think is a is a great example um what we see here is we see uh while growth overall is kind of mediocre it's important to benchmark the european economy by what its potential is which is its potential growth is essentially zero the reason why that is is labor force growth in uh in europe is roughly zero maybe a touch over zero uh and productivity growth in europe is also close to zero you put that together even though we have had roughly zero growth in the european economy which you see over here on the lower uh left-and side for you know really for two years it's been bas basically at zero on an annualized basis unemployment rates have continued to decline and are at secular lows which highlights the fact that the underlying uh capacity the underlying uh the the underlying uh uh uh growth potential growth rate of the economy continues to be so low that you can continue to tighten labor markets in an environment of zero growth and that's really important because that situation where we have an environment of tight labor markets is continuing to create elevated wage pressures and the ecb specifically mentioned elevated wage pressures as a concern causing them to delay tightening or delay easing uh because those wage that wage growth is so strong and the and the and the measures of inflation which have come which have generally come down core inflation have generally come down did you know have shown a couple a bit of a spike back up raising concerns uh from the ecb that maybe the inflation problem uh that had been experienced in previous you know over the course of the last couple years is not yet beat uh so you look at that and it and it's interesting you know lard is probably even more uh aggressive than powell when speaking about the future path of monetary policy but this idea of not even discussing what's going on not even discussing an opportunity to cut rates which honestly is consistent with the overall macroeconomic environment where inflation doesn't quite look be and the economy is not weak enough to create an urgency to cut interest rates in the ecb the uk and bank of england is largely you're largely getting a similar picture while growth has been relatively mediocre employment conditions uh with the most recent report this week ticked back down below 4% so secularly low unemployment uh you have very strong wage growth nominal wage growth that's you know well above inflation and in the six % range depending on how you look at it timely measures uh which are uh the composite pmis in in the uk and also in europe are pretty good measures unlike in the us context you're actually seeing acceleration in the composite pmis including the most recent one uh over the course of the last week or so so you're getting strength in the timeliest measures of growth and you're seeing overall inflation rates which have moderated to some extent but are still not yet totally uh totally solved uh in terms of the inflation problem there and so when you look at you know a big thing when i when i sort of framed coming into the year the basic risk that i saw the risk in the markets or the mispriced dynamic in the markets that i saw was that um it that it was very possible that we were likely to see economic conditions that didn't align with the significant cuts in interest rates ates that are currently priced in and as we're getting this information coming in both in the us context which is you know growing quite strongly and um you know has had a period of elevated inflation but also what we see across the rest of the major developed economies and i could show you you know australia and canada here as well that are basically experiencing the same combination of dynamics canada a little softer australia a little a little stronger um but overall the real question is is why should these central banks move anywhere near as fast as what's currently priced into these mark into these short rate markets when they're facing the set of conditions that we're seeing here and so the biggest risk continues to be that central banks disappoint in the magnitude of the easing across these economies uh that is currently priced in now connecting that to asset prices which i think is you know we don't trade economies we trade asset prices um is very important uh and what i'd say in that context is if we have an en of strong growth or stronger than expected growth which is leading to those cuts getting priced out it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to see a bad environment for equities uh and if anything what 2023 uh taught many people was that an environment where the economy is strong and cuts start to get priced out is a good environment for stocks as growth continues to outpace expectations and a particularly bad environment for bonds and so when i look at this overall mix of things i don't think there's much here that creates a lot of concern for the equity market until we get uh bond yields rising to the extent that they start to meaningfully constrain economic activity and we're not there yet so not a lot dragging down stocks with expectations and concerns that you know certainly from parts of the market that we were going to have a really weak uh economic environment and but but so bad for you know fine for stocks but particularly bad for bonds both in particularly in the us context on the short end as the pricing that's currently priced in is unlikely to be achieved but also on the long end as that duration supply comes in and so we could easily see a mix of dynamics where we have stocks continue uh to move higher uh as we talked about over the course of the last you know couple of months um at a time when we get uh you know the short rate market the twos selling off and the longer end of the market selling off even more as they're hit both by the duration supply as well as the uh pricing out of the expected cuts so you you put that together you know good for stocks not great for bonds for commodities in general that's a good environment should be incrementally good for commodities particularly extractive commodities um but a lot of that hinges on china which we'll talk about here in in in a minute um so i i think you know china many ways we've been through uh a lot there's a lot of focus on chinese uh on chinese equity markets uh and the fact that chinese equity markets continue to go down particularly relative developed economies and drawing parallels to what happened in 2018 or 2015 and 16 when we saw stress in china flow through to develop markets we're not seeing that kind of stress flow through to develop markets today and the primary reason why that is is that the chinese stock market is not the chinese economy and if anything those two things are meaningfully diverging from each other um and what we see here on the leand side is of course the difference in the uh in the in the stock prices of the chinese stocks which have continued to plummet new lows uh despite i'd emphasize many different government attempts to stabilize chinese you know chinese stocks none of which have gone to fruition the reason why that is is that the various interventions in that market haven't done really anything to change the underlying fun fundamental uh dynamics economics of those stocks they've just tried to intervene or create short-term pops of confidence in that asset market so they've continued to decline but interestingly when you look across the actual real economy information that can be drawn from timely uh timely commodity price outcomes as well as trade information which is probably the highest quality data the sort of realist data that we can see because we can see it also on the importer side of where it's coming from what you see is actually things are totally fine um uh in the middle column what you see is you see iron ore prices there at the top steel prices as well as copper prices what's going on with all those the answer is like not much if anything prices across those commodities are up relative to they were where they were last summer and during this period of significant equity market decline have largely been stable to up during that period this is not you know if china's economic conditions were meaningfully deteriorating what you'd see here across this middle column is you'd see a lot of weakness in these assets and you're not seeing it and that's also confirmed by what you see on the right hand side which i think is important to look at the actual exports now of course china's a big diversified economy with a lot of domestic demand but the export sector gives you a lot of insight into what exactly you know it gives you a timely insight into whether there are big shifts going on when looking at imports whether there are big shifts going on with domestic demand and whether from exports the manufacturing sector is significantly deteriorating and again in the context of the normal volatility of chinese exports and imports what we're seeing is something that you know had a big boom right after the right after co for instance the exports had a big boom right after covid given the restocking that moderated and now it's been mostly stable and on the import side similar dynamics largely stable over the course of the last year or so when it comes to what when it comes to the import picture and so what that adds up to is that um if you want to understand china's impact on the global economy stop looking at their equity market and the reason why that is is that you know the equity market is primarily domestically oriented primarily driven by domestic supply and demand considerations and it's primarily not a reflection of the economic conditions of china there's all sorts of different policy things going on you know chinese the new es of chinese political considerations is above my pay grade other than to say it's you know there are it's it's very likely what we're seeing is we're seeing a set of policies that are being pursued that are inconsistent with the style of policies that exist um that you'd expect from western style economic management and so it's important to remain open-minded that that is a reality is that they may be pursuing uh you know they may may not for instance desire to have a buoyant equity market for all sorts of domestic consideration reasons and and and instead be more concerned with having a stable but not extreme set of economic growth in the domestic economy and that's essentially what it looks like they've achieved and honestly what it looks like they've achieved over the course of the last couple years which is stable fine you know kind of mediocre economic expansion which is not neither you know being meaningfully accelerated by big injection of credit and fiscal stimulus nor is really being uh allowed to weaken all that much more um given the steps that are being taken that are responsive to areas of weakness and so china in many ways right now looks like uh uh flat you know not the primary driver of the incremental changes in the global economy just kind of a steady modest demand given their policy choices so with that um we will uh let me take some questions if if you all have questions uh that have been following along definitely chuck them into the q&a i'll try and get to as many of these as uh as possible uh let me start with the first uh here i i had uh from i'm going to go through a few of the submissions uh earlier the first is basically what are what are your thoughts on the emerging credit issues uh coming into the uh into the cr sector obviously gotten a lot of attention with new york community bank over the course of the last week um new york community bank is uh concerns or issues is a highly idiosyncratic situation one that i wouldn't draw a lot of parallels to i i think a lot of folks are uh just assuming uh are drawing a connection between the current cr problems in particularly office cr problems and the types of conditions that we saw uh during the global financial crisis and i would emphasize that there is a big a radical difference between those two environments and the reason why that is is first uh cr is on balance sheet lending on balance sheet lending takes time to be recognized those losses those delinquencies and losses take time to be recognized those losses only get recognized once there's non-payment and can be extended modified adjusted there's lots of different things bank can banks can do to push out the losses uh over time uh number two is the nature the economic exposure that the banks have and the risk that they have um is uh because it's in loans doesn't have to be marked to market nearly as quickly as what we saw in the global financial crisis the global financial crisis those are securities holdings those securities holdings had to be mark to market relatively close to fair value relatively quickly and so you have a situation with c that's likely to play out over 10 years let's say and even if you had double financial cr crisis losses in c relative to the acute crisis that happened with residential real estate securities that would be a totally different dynamic for for the banks today because it would give them years of earning power and in fact if what you did is you went through and you assumed that the c loss the total cr losses um for these banks were double what they were in the depression which would be ext an extraordinarily loss rate and you gave them five years to recognize them they would earn for the small banks they would earn more nim more incremental nim even if their nim was cut by 50% then would be the total loss rate across all of those loans that they have on their books so and so what it means is you you could have extraordinary losses as long as the banks can push off the the losses into history earn nim even depress nim they can absorb it without even going into their already relatively elevated regulatory capital and so uh the thought you know i think a lot of people are looking around and saying let me find the next crisis and the next crisis it will not come from c uh and take that from a person who called the financial crisis right and also cause called the svb circumstance uh not derailing the economy right right they're two totally different circumstances two totally different times um got a question here about what could derail the mag7 um besides higher rates i think one of the things that's really interesting about the mag s um is that is is how much of the earnings that you're seeing from the mag 7 is not uh novel it's not coming from novel uh you know ai or technology like what is meta or google uh they're technology companies but really what they are are point of the spear advertising companies uh and so in a lot of ways what we see or what what is amazon amazon is an advertising company a consumer demand company and a business investment company right and so what we're seeing with those companies if you actually get into their transcripts get away from the hype and the and the and the future you know the the the future that's being painted by various people if you get into the nuts and bolts of the earnings what you see is you see that these companies are doing well because consumer demand remains elevated and companies are responding to that consumer demand by advertising and by investing and so as long as that dynamic continues in a lot of ways what we're seeing with the mag 7 is is not necessarily novel technology but a set of companies that have the highest betas to economic conditions and so it's not surprising than when there was concern about economic conditions and actual softening in late 2022 that those companies underperformed and it's also not that surprising that in an environment where economic conditions continue to be very strong uh and are stronger than people expect for those companies to actually create uh you know to to continue to to strengthen and so i i think in a lot of ways focusing on the mag 7 mag s are better representation of the most cyclical parts of the us economy much more so than they are representations of novel technology um let's go uh uh let's go to another question um about uh someone mentioned here basically that the economy is doing fine yet you're not actually seeing uh a lot of strength particularly in oil um any market comes down to supply and demand uh and one of the key things you know it's not really being talked about a lot uh sort of in the general consensus is is just how much oil supply has come into the market particularly from the us us production is pushing new highs uh and a lot of what we're seeing in order to prop up the price um is is that opec has to cut in response to the significant us oil supply that's coming on and so while oil prices have been relatively contained in the context of an overall strong economy an important reason why that is is because of that supply factor and so um there's good reason to believe that that will continue uh to be pretty strong pretty healthy domestic oil supply which is gna you know which will possibly keep a lid on the strength of the the market uh relative to other to other areas um and also i think in that context helps create you know keep inflation pressures down which should advantage stocks uh during this environment let's get some of these uh questions that came in while we were talking we'll try and hit a couple of these um let's see uh just running through these um i think i think a good a good question here which um which is always important as we're as we're looking at these um at these data coming in which is you know what would make you change your mind on the global economy uh before other people see it and and this also connects to do expect uh for conditions to eventually lead to recession um and what i'd emphasize with that is that uh there is a there's a there's a there's an order for those of you who have been around uh these uh conversations for a little while you've heard me talk about the order and what the order is is there's a set of of linkages that need to occur in order for us to get to a point uh of where um of where the economy is going to meaningfully slow into a recessionary environment um you know the basic idea of uh in you know stocks are likely to continue to outperform bonds as long as the economy is strong the economy is likely to strong as long as stocks and housing prices remain elevated and stocks and housing prices are likely to remain elevated as long as bond yields don't rise too much and so that set of linkages it's a very important set of linkages because what it what it what it um it sits on is whether or not there's a sufficient market-based tightening in the bond market to start to create both a hit to asset prices and a hit to economic activity uh and you know if anything what we've seen over the course of the last six months is that bond yields have come down not up that it's incrementally stimulative not incrementally tightening and so in order again to go to those linkages in order to get the eventual recession you have to get that bond yield to rise which then hits asset markets which then hits demand which then hits earnings which then hits employment which then hits incomes which eventually creates the negative reinforcing cycle and so if we go to this question what would change my mind about the global economy would be going through that environment of enough of a rise in bond yields to start to create uh those significant drags on asset prices in the economy and i think actually that the the period la that the sort of fall period last last year was really instructive because we had boni's press all the way to five and we had a mod of sell-off in stocks but go look at the underlying economic data we didn't really see if anything you know the third quarter was was particularly strong a little bit you know goofy technical stuff but but it you know but the fourth quarter was very strong um and so i think that gives you a sense that highlights the type of underlying strength that exists in the economy and really how far you know you'd have to have those rates move up for an extended period of time and have stocks move down for an extended period of time to get there so by focusing on the linkages that's how you're going to get edge ahead of markets and the economy in predicting what's likely to transpire um and in that in that context i'll answer this this other question about a target for tens now in general i don't i don't think that trading to a target is makes a lot of sense and and the reason why that is is there's a lot of unknowable and they can change but what you can start to do is think about what are the pressures and where does val factor where does value come in what's a fair value of where we are with a variety of securities and that i think that's helpful in sort of benchmarking where we are in that process so you know today on tens we're at 4:15 give or take um and when i think about tens what i think about sort of a more structural fair value uh what i'd say is that you know something like let's say 2% real rates given the strength of the economy uh inflation expectations of maybe two 2.25 let's say let's say 2.25 and then i think a term premium that has yet to be fully reflected you know we have a term premium after this rally that's back to negative negative rates um and so a term premium that looks something like 75 or 100 basis points give or take uh is a more normal term premium than the type of term premiums that existed prior to the financial crisis and would take bond yields at fair value to say roughly five and so you know is that is does that mean that we're we're absolutely on the fast track to five and you know we're going to go through it not necessarily but what it means is that you know when i look at 415 i say we at least got you know 30 40 50 basis points of move up here before we start to get into a fair value range um let me uh i think there's a couple questions here and i'll i'll um and i'll uh and i'll before i wrap up um so i think there's a there's a couple questions about about the fiscal situation um going on as well which you know look fiscal deficits are relatively substantial um there's a lot of questions about whether there is an ability to fund the elevated fiscal deficits particularly with the magnitude of the issuance uh that's coming to the market and whether that'll start to create policy implementation uh that could um that could constrain further bond yield rises um the first thing i'd say is fiscal policy is relatively loose there's a you know the reasons we sort of all know the reasons why fiscal policy in the us has been so expansionary um the two different parties uh and candidates for president are largely appear to be in favor of expanding the fiscal deficit or continuing elevated fiscal deficits during good economic conditions they have slightly different flavors of it u between you know tax cuts and you know business subsidies versus um versus uh transfer payments to lower income cohorts uh but the basic story is we're going to be here with large fiscal deficits for an extended period of time the question whether they can get financed is an important one um but one that really is more a question of at what price in the medium term uh you know we could easily have uh this amount of issuance have a much more normalized uh a much more normalized uh term structure term premium for buyers of bonds that more normalized term premium can happen through a variety of different ways it could happen through lower short end rates it can happen through higher long end rates um we're not you know radically far away from uh from from being able to shift uh prices and yields to be able to create something that is significantly more attractive relative to cash and so in the sort of shortish term let's say the next year or two i i don't really see a meaningful concern the real concern would come if the deficits are so large that it causes interest rates to to rise at a time when that sort of rise is inconsistent with desirable or reasonable monetary policy right today we have upward pressure on yields you know in part because there's uh you know the econom is pretty good um and if anything we probably use a little tightening on the long end and so the question of yield curve control and how the fed will respond really is a question of how things will transpire when we get an environment where we a significant economic downturn are in need of uh of easing and therefore uh need to ensure that the long end doesn't rise uh too substantially so that is like ahead well ahead not something that if you're trading markets today really makes a ton of sense to worry about or consider and i'd al also emphasize that i think we keep getting these small tests in terms of whether people are interested in buying us duration and look like bon yels just went down 125 basis points i i think the idea that there's you know on a modest concern that there would be weakening economic conditions i think the idea that people are going to totally go away from the us bond market particularly in an economic down term i you know my guess is that won't happen um or it'll be a modest effect rather than a significant effect but the central bank and the fed has the tools necessary to be able to respond on to those conditions
What's Happening with Treasury Auctions?,2024-02-11 13:15:03+00:00,3,d8vYGzZyfVk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8vYGzZyfVk,all right let's fold fixed income to this into this conversation as well alex was talking about the 30-year treasury auction pretty good demand pretty good demand for the 10year auction as well so february looking okay when it comes to the treasury refunding itself um what is your read here on the supply that we're going to get this year and whether that demand will continue to show up well those 30 years that got issued earlier this afternoon are now you know through the bottoms and so we're seeing yields rising we're seeing that creeping happening uh for many of those buyers that are continuing to experience losses you know we moved from well under well under four in now you know up to 415 on 10 and i think the key thing to remember with the bond issuance dynamic is that it's going to be very hard to front run $500 billion doll of net new supply in quarter two and so it's every day what you're seeing is a weight on the bond market that's coming as that issuance comes and remember the q2 net issuance is going to be twice as big as q1 so right now the actual flow the actual ual demand to borrow is not that bad just wait till q2 when it doubles in size on net true but we could have said that like in the fourth quarter of last year and then the takedown actually went okay what do you do in a market though you come in every day and things look overbought technicals do not look good and we continue to grind higher like how do you manage that well i think you got to you got to look at the linkages that that will either stop the economy in its tracks or keep it going and we've got this income fueled expansion and in that environment stocks can continue to outp perform particularly bonds as income growth continues to finance spending and we continue to get strong nominal gdp growth that's a very resilient type of growth this is not the debt fueled growth of you know cycles past this is a very uh this is a this is a expansion that can continue for an extended period of time until we get enough tightening in the financial markets to start to bring down asset prices and slow the overall economy so right now we're really in that that sweet spot grow without tightening particularly on the long end of the bond market to bring things how high do yields have to go before you start to see it show up inequities in a bad way well i think we saw a little bit of a flavor of that last year but we we moov bond yields up to five and equity sold off you know 10% 15% that's not that big a deal equity sell off 10 or 15% all the time and so we're probably going to need to get bond yields up there and for an extended period of time before there's enough of a wait on asset prices in the real economy to really bring this expansion to a halt all right bob really appreciate you're joining us today
Resilient U.S. Equity Markets,2024-02-10 13:15:00+00:00,2,5ztLlBKFyWM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztLlBKFyWM,started off our conversation with bob elliott he is ceo and cio over at unlimited and alex says it's all about tech maybe they should be their own index and you know the magnificent seven it pretty much is and then you look at all the other national markets whether it's the us whether it's china whether it's anything else you take out us tech how attractive is the us market and the us economy to the rest of uh the investing investing world well i think what the meate tech uh tech uh stocks really are highlighting is the is the cyclical strength of the economy when you actually break these these stocks down what are they really amazon is consumer sales and business investment google is advertising meta is advertising and so i think what they're really showing is that the in aggregate the us economy nominal gdp growth it's very strong it continues and they just have some of the highest betas uh and best cash flows to that strengthen the overall economy so when you look to the rest of the the overall market what you see is companies that maybe aren't quite as strong and are more sensitive to the liquidity conditions that are going on um but those companies have a chance to rally in these sort of environments as liquidity starts to ease a little bit the fed shifts their policy stance and gdp growth continues to expand so is that'll buy small caps that's right i mean you could easily get a rotation here into the small caps will it last i mean we saw this trap last year and did not last well i think i think the main reason why it didn't last was uh the real question was whether monetary policy was going to continue to be tight uh and whether that was that tightness of monetary policy and the difficult of financing conditions was going to keep weighing on those on those uh companies that needed the ongoing financing we're shifting to almost a perfect situation for many of those companies where the economy is good but we're shifting to an easing cycle with low valuations you put that all together if people are looking for you know corners of the market that haven't been bit up nearly as much they're going to look to those areas like energy and small cap
What’s Supporting the Dollar Rally?,2024-02-09 13:15:03+00:00,3,pHM9_ttnAaQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHM9_ttnAaQ,uh can you see uh give me a fundamental narrative on why this dollar rally can end and reverse can you come up with anything on that well i think it comes i mean the us economy is a lot what's that yields yeah i mean i think the us economy is just a lot stronger than the rest of the world and so that should favor the dollar relative to other currencies from a monetary policy perspective and from the continued inflow of capital and and our you know somewhat higher yields are bring you know we're actually getting a lot of bond demand from from foreigners uh which on the margin is uh is is dollar supportive as well so you know i think the basic structure of the dollar is tilted on the upside um okay which is kind of what you see what you see here you know once we had the reset of monetary policy expectations basically just been moving higher right meandering higher yeah well we were stuck in a range until the uh employment report yeah and and we had a break out here um but it was a nice advance from down here in december everyone was bearish a dollar down here everyone was bullish a dollar up here i was just wondering if there was any kind of fundamental narrative and sometimes they don't really uh appear until a move has been underway for a while then there's an exp explanation it's like traders live in the future and reporters um report what's happening today right i think the next the next catalyst here is uh european inflation uh numbers coming in soft uh in the next couple months that's really which will give the ecb some room to cut to actually cut um okay and that should be bullish a dollar still bullish a dollar sorry yeah yeah that's okay yeah see so you can't come up for with a reason to be uh looking for a dollar top at this time there's there's nothing i don't see it also if you if you zoom out you know the the valuation here this is not um you know this is we're i i was thinking uh yeah if you know i don't know here's a here's a give me a couple years there you go there you go you know we're still we still uh are not so toppy in the value from a valuation perspective here at all so um all right
What's The Story with Regional Banks?,2024-02-08 13:15:02+00:00,4,W-zYvXA0ijk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-zYvXA0ijk,if i look at a weekly of the regionals and i know everyone's very bullish the russell i know some people talking about it doubling etc but look at this uh weekly so here was svb down here yep and they had this is when they put the emergency facility in and you know if the emergency's over why do they still have that facility and then uh i don't know if you noticed it but i had a guest tom melanin who showed me a chart that for a while there wasn't it was flatlining but then all of a sudden borrowing from that facility started to head higher again so there it it may still be an emergency or why haven't they ended the program and you know this does not look that bullish unless we get over 52 this could put a little damper on the party doesn't it look like a bare market rally to you in the regional banks money center doing better yeah well i think we got we got most of the when we moved into the 52 on um on this it uh yeah like like basically the post svb recognition uh and rebound was kind of done and i it's it's one of those things where you know this is probably in the world of picking up nicholls or whatever like you know probably 50 is the is the fair value on the on ac the regionals right now and was it at 47 and was up at 5 you know like so value this is probably yeah this is probably not a place to spend a lot of mental energy would be my my guess like it's not the fundamentals don't align with going down meaningfully further and the reason why that is a big part of that pickup and borrowing was because there was an arbitrage that the fed uh squashed uh associated with being able to borrow at a rate that was lower than the deposit rate at the fed so you could borrow the rate you could borrow at the one-ear rate which obviously because there's cuts priced in is lower than the the spot deposit rate and so you could collect you know 50 or or 50 or so uh or 75 basis points on that trade you know essentially risk-free because you could just pay back the loan whenever you wanted and so and you saw the second that that arb opened up is when this this borrowing re accelerated the the real thing to look at in the regional banks is the deposit dynamics and just seeing you see there is that deposits have been flat for i mean really have been flat for like six months all right no flight nothing's going on it's not very interesting on that maybe since rates peaked um people don't care as much is that could that be part of it i i mean uh i i have spent uh more time than uh than than most in the uh the small bank world the reality is that the deposits in small banks are are sticky because they're not investment assets they're transactional accounts you know mostly held by businesses and households you know paying their bills like it's not and they're mostly be like most of the reason why they have their deposits there is because that's who gave them the loan you know the bank on the street down the street for them on main street and so the the reality is just like a lot less interesting than what the financial press would tell you like you know sure deposits went out a few you know a few percent of deposits went out but the big picture is it's not very interesting and you know mostly these banks are just kind of getting squeezed to some extent because you know rates are a little higher and they can't fully pass that on to borrowers which is why a reset of the prices is f like down to 50 from where we were in the sort of low 60s makes sense
"Inflation is Down, But Can it Stay There?",2024-02-06 13:15:01+00:00,3,ANUFxe6ygA0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANUFxe6ygA0,we certainly have reached a point which would be consistent with the soft landing which is you know decent gdp growth no deterioration unemployment and inflation back to the fed's target the question is not do we have a print or set of a couple of prints that meet the soft landing the question is do we stay there for you know six months or a year and when you're trading markets that's really what you care about you don't really care about you know did we put in some few a few prints that look that way and that's where i'm a little more skeptical now i think my skepticism uh is uh placed in a slightly different place than it is than than that of last bear who um who you know is smart guy should definitely follow and read his stuff for sure i think i'm more concerned about the inflationary acceleration occurring in particularly around you know the composition if we get down to the composition of how we've achieved inflation close to the fed's mandate um what we've done is we've had really weak particularly goods prices and falling the direct and indirect effects of falling oil prices and gas prices really help get us to the point where um we're getting that 2% print and we still have elevated services prices that probably won't get us resolved resolved as quickly either housing or non-housing as people expect um given wage and inflation and also given uh the aggregate um the aggregate tenant renewal rate that's going on rather than the new uh rather than the new tenant renewal rates and so i put that together and i say looks like we could have more services inflation for longer than people expect and the odds that we'll continue to see meaningfully negative goods price inflation like we've seen would require continuation of price falls at the same pace that they have been at i'm not sure we can necessar neily predict that in the future we've seen gas prices stabilizing here are a small uptick there's reasons to believe that the geopolitical issues will flow through to rising goods prices uh on a long lag but by the end of the year and so i look at that combination of things combined with an economy that's doing pretty well i think we could easily start to see you know a bit of a a takeoff again in inflation not in two months or 3 months but by the end of the year and that would be um inconsistent with having actually achieved uh the the soft landing uh in a durable way rather than in a short-term way
What Is A Neutral Interest Rate?,2024-02-05 13:15:02+00:00,3,UgCMEUK8opE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgCMEUK8opE,why the assumption that it is quote too high given this economy right if we look back in history rates have been a lot higher than we've been seeing over the last couple of years gdp growth is still outperforming what is it that's too high about these current rate levels given everything seems to be going pretty well well i think you're right when you watch well the the one is a neutral interest r in the economy is not a theoretical concept it's an empirical concept and it the economy is going pretty well and and to be clear has gone well for six quarters during a more elevated industry environment so those folks who were saying well the lags and the lag defective interest rate heights will eventually show up if like if the lag effects of the interest rate hikes are going to show up when are they going to show up because interest rates have been you know have been elevated for quite a while ex i think it's mostly fed economists who are running econometric models that are highly focused on you know the post gfc period who are benchmarking neutral at 2.5% instead of looking at the empirical evidence of how this economy is doing which looks you know suggest that maybe the neutral the neutral fed rate is a lot closer to the 5% that we saw in the '90s than the two and a half that those economists are predicting and and so bob just to to hone in on that point a little bit more what is it that could have driven a change in the neutral interest rate is it the underlying rate of productivity growth is it underlying labor participation like what exact is it that could have changed that anchor point i think there's a couple different things that have strengthened the underlying structural growth in the economy uh a big one is that we've had a big shift in uh dent conditions you know household dents today as a function of the significant increase in incomes nominal incomes over the course of the last 15 years and the pay down of all that debt that was built up prior to the financial crisis had the debts have been meaningfully restructured and a lot of that debt service was locked in at very low rates um when rates were were were low the same thing is true for corporations and so the debt burdens that existed post gfc have moderated we have seen a pick up in productivity in the economy probably not what not driven by sort of ai and technological innovations but more traditional cyclical productivity improvements that happened late cycle that raises the the baseline interest rate and we have seen in inreased labor force growth in the last couple of years particularly related to immigration you add all those things out no one of them is so significant that would meaningfully shift uh the the benchmark neutral interest rate but you put all these things together and again we might be seeing sort of neutal interest rates in this economy that look closer to four or four an half than they do to two an
Thinking Through A Macro Lens About Economic Policy Decisions,2024-02-04 13:15:02+00:00,3,LVsFjB6fdfM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVsFjB6fdfM,from the the financial crisis on right like people know that they need to watch the fed is the fed raising or lowering short-term interest rates but to understand the true financial conditions that are affecting the economy and and the markets whether there's a tightening or easing in those conditions requires so much more it's more complex today following the financial crisis it became about quantitative easing when the fed couldn't lower short-term interest rates any f farther and it hit its lower bound with the pandemic there's so much more happening with fiscal policy and fiscal stimulus and you know even regulatory policy i'm curious like how do you think about and assess the impact of each of these when you're shaping your macro outlook and investment strategies how do you how do you kind of get your head around how all of these different policy responses are impacting the economy yeah i think most people will think about those individual pieces in a way that's relatively discreet and almost almost in a way that's like a diffusion index is this positive is this negative uh is it supportive is it contractionary and i think the key the key thing you have to do from a macroeconomic perspective is not just understand the nature of the linkages of fiscal policy or quantitative tightening or the rise in interest rates but you have to translate that into a concrete and numerical understanding of the magnitude of the influence of those activities and i think that's the thing that's a very you it's both a very hard thing to do because you have to work through all of those linkages and the quantification of them and it's also the area that i think a lot of folks will miss and so whether it's the data that you're looking at or the linkages of monetary fiscal and say regulatory policy that's what you have to do and so too often folks look for confirmatory evidence in say data that is aligned with their views without going through through that process i think like a like a funny one that came up recently is you the empire fed manufacturing index went down a lot uh earlier this week the week that we were recording and you know how many charts did we see on twitter about that and that survey first of all is a pretty bad survey in terms of quality but also it only represents 6% of the economic activity of the economy yet when you get you know a positive confirmatory dynamic like initial claims being a two-year lows people don't necessarily want want to want to uh reject that evidence when that is a highquality comprehensive coverage of the overall economy and so that's where you have to get into the nuts and bolts and really quantify these things and not rely sort of on the narrative senses of what's likely to be you know what what what one data point or set of policies is pointing to versus another yeah point six doesn't sound much not too far off from uh taylor swift's effect
Strong Job Market Fuels Equity Markets,2024-02-04 13:00:11+00:00,1,Hw0sxrDD--0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw0sxrDD--0,are not the place to go bob maybe equity is looking more attractive right now um where would you be put putting money to work especially in a day where we're talking about record highs for the major averages but the russell 2000 didn't have a great week regional banks back in focus again right and i think what that is is is you're starting to get a a the bears are trying to pick out the the corners of the market that they think uh are going to underperform uh on a forward-looking basis and the reality is that if we're going to have the strength of growth that we see right now with the fed while maybe not cutting nearly as much as would be desired still in that easier monetary policy stance and a number of those areas like the regional banks like the russell 2k those the pricing the valuation there looks pretty good the idea that we might get a a rotation into those areas of the market here in 24 uh looks pretty pretty compelling given the overall growth dynamics that we're seeing yeah
What if Inflation Doesn't Move to 2%,2024-02-03 13:15:02+00:00,5,Gcq3ihDDXE0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcq3ihDDXE0,and where do you see the big risk so clearly you think the the recession risk is overpriced in the market right now is there anything else that you're you know is kind of sitting in the back of your mind is okay this might be the worrisome thing i think the biggest risk is that inflation doesn't move back down durably to central banks 2% targets and uh put out something a little earlier this week if you just if you just scan through the data and you look at those data points related to say uk inflation ukuk inflation you know stabilizing core inflation stabilizing at a level that's that's you know around 5% the bank of england's mandate is two it is not five and so you know five is very far from two and if it's stabilizes at five that's going to be a real problem and there's some real risks related to that given that wage growth is growing at between six and 7% depending on how you how you measure it and the uk has real productivity stagnation the same thing in europe although europe's a little bit better but we did see a pop in inflation in the most recent print canada you're seeing you know inflation looks like it's stabilizing in that sort of 3 to four range australia the timeliest inflation numbers popped and you know looks like it's stabilizing in the 5% range like that that whole us cpi looks like it's stabilizing between three and 4% like you sort of add all those up and you sort of look at it and you go what's the world going to be like if in 6 months we've sort of stabilized here in inflation and then additionally what does that world look like if a number of these disinflationary pressures that have been important in bringing and resolving inflation from being very high to where it is today what if those disinflationary pressures flip inflationary you know in the us we've we've benefited like gas prices have gone from five to four to three bucks a gallon that's a big disinflationary impulse in the economy what happens if gas prices start to rise again goods prices globally have gone from rising in price to meaningfully contracting in price what happens if that starts to moderate go to zero or go to positive as a result of some of these geopolitical tensions that are going on all of that is a very worrisome circumstance particularly in the context of a set of global bond markets that are really pricing in expectations of a rapid shift to cuts over the course of 24 yeah and in that scenario where inflation stabilizes but stays well above central bank mandates well above the you know the 2% where it's an explicit mandate well above two where it's more implicit what do you think central banks do do they just say well we got to keep tightening up financial conditions we got to raise rates well i think the central banks are actually in a pretty good position here in a way to respond to if that circumstance arises which is the central banks can get a meaningful tightening of conditions simply by doing nothing so that's a pretty good position to be in right because they can they can basically say instead of you know cutting in line with what's priced into the markets they can they can just not ease consistent with that they can do you know they can just hold current policy let's say instead of higher for longer it's high for longer right that policy is going to be a lot more defensible it's reasonably defensible look we're just taking in more data we're seeing what's going on etc and would probably allow them to maintain economic conditions to continue to see that growth while implementing slightly tighter monetary policy which hopefully could moderate things enough to start to ease some of the pressures off on inflation but the the real sticky point the real sticky point is what happens if two steps down the line which is these economies are fine uh inflation settles in a rate that's a little too high central banks basically you know stand back from the easing cycle that's expected you get a tightening of financial conditions and it's just not enough tightening of financial conditions to then create you know inflation moving even further down you know that's a sticky point but you know between then and where we are today there's a relatively straightforward policy of doing nothing that could you know go a long way
"Economic Conditions in Europe, UK and Japan in Ealry 2024",2024-02-02 13:15:02+00:00,4,ZjraPK9drbs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjraPK9drbs,i think in many ways europe is the exact opposite of the us in the sense of uh inflation has moderated considerably that's what you see in this upper right chart that moderation of inflation has now brought core uh and headlined inflation basically between one and two% which is where the the ecb's mandate is their sole mandate um we've seen a significant slowing of economic conditions where we've seen probably six months of negative gdp growth uh if you take a bottoms up perspective from the underlying data and don't wait for the actual gdp report that's what it's looking like here in the second half of the year and yet the amount of of easing that's priced in to the european curve is the same exact amount of easing that's priced into the us curve now think about that you've got two economies that have radically different outcomes one which has secularly tight condition conditions inflation that is still a bit above what the central bank's mandate is and growth that's above potential and and it just experienced a huge easing and you' got another economy where inflation is below the central bank's target and where growth is contracting to totally different environments and yet the same pricing and i think that creates a very interesting opportunity from a diff perspective uh the uk is another example uh of this as well pricing in basically the same amount of cuts as in the us and as in europe i think it falls nicely in between the two where growth conditions are weaker uh but there's still inflationary pressures and so uh you have a central bank that um in many ways is not even thinking about uh thinking about thinking about easing uh if you look at what their most recent votes are uh and so i think it's another case where the idea that the bank of england is going to cut anywhere near as much as the ecb over the course of 2024 seems improbable given the set of conditions that are in the uk relative to the set of conditions that are in the euro zone japan totally different story here um has uh we've we've we talked basically nine months ago for those of you follow me on twitter uh about the shift in uh central bank leadership and whether that would create a significant change in monetary policy since then the bank of japan has done a couple of tweaks of their yield curve control measures uh but has not significantly shifted their policy stance which is one that is incredibly easy uh over time and if anything that is increasingly making sense for them to not shift any further as what we see is that the inflation measures uh have come down considerably over there on the left hand side is the core inflation which is printed you know in the 1 to 2% range over the course of the last uh couple of months we saw the same with a tokyo cpi number that came out earlier this week as well as the uh wage growth numbers which were printing at zero year-over-year none of that from an inflation perspective suggests an inflation problem or an urgency to tighten and at the same time we've seen some moderation in growth particularly driven by some of the weaker demand circumstances in asia and so that's what you see over there on the right hand side is negative gdp growth low inflation this is not an economy that where it makes sense to to tighten anything yet 65 basis points of tightening are priced in to the short end in japan in 2024 the odds that that happened given the set of conditions seem very low
Why the Fed is Keeping Rates Steady?,2024-02-01 13:15:03+00:00,4,zNvayEcQbVg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNvayEcQbVg,how do you see macro conditions of olving as we move into 2024 in a lot of ways i think we're on a path at least in the us economy uh from the us economy that looks what i'm calling stronger for longer i think a lot of folks you know again if we talked at the outset you know 18 months ago thought the economy was going into an immediate recession and we're sort of surprised to the upside as the resilience occurred in many ways i think early 24 is setting in many of the the the same ways that early 23 set up where there was you know significant economic uh you know economist expectations of weakening economic conditions as well as market pricing of much weaker economic conditions i me entering the year we had something like a one-third probability that we'd see interest rates below 3% uh by the end of the year priced into the short-term interest rate markets that's not you know modest interest rate cuts in response to flagging inflation that's a sharp recession akin to 2008 that's what was priced in a 35% chance of a 2008 style dynamic going on in the us economy and there's there's nothing in way in the way of data if you focus on the data and you look at the linkages that aligns with that type of sharp recession in the economy growth is above potential unemployment rates at secular lows if anything the strength of stocks as well as the the fallen bond yields the end of 23 is creating a short-term acceleration in the economy um which we're seeing in the timeliest uh stats that are coming out none of that aligns with an immediate recession and so uh what we've seen over the course of the last you know couple of days is uh that pricing is starting to come out of the market we're starting to see those bond sell-offs we're starting to see the two-year market move back up from the lows that we saw and i think all of that around this recognition that maybe the us economy isn't going into the recession nearly as quickly as folks expect and you brought up the bond market but i wanted to ask you from an investor standpoint where do you see the big opportunities and the risks in the coming year well we're still pricing in 140 basis points of easing into the short-term interest rate market uh at a time when you know growth is above potential unemployment is a secular lows and inflation's a little too hot for the central bank's mandate like if you if you just plopped me into a random time in the world and said hey what do you think if if you saw this set of economic conditions that are unfolding plus the amount of financial market stimulation that we've seen in the recent period what do you think the central bank stance would be and my my answer would be well you maybe nothing doing nothing would be would be a totally reasonable stance for the central bank given the set of conditions i mean just think about it if you're in the fed shoes and you're getting growth that's pretty good and you're getting labor markets that are aligned with what you want and even even if inflation has come down and has close to your mandate why would you do anything right you're getting you're accomplishing all of your goals without having to do anything differently and it's it's sort of the natural state unless there's a big economic a big growth crash it's the natural state for central banks to be very slow moving and so why wouldn't the fed here be slow moving the way that it has been in the past
China is in a Disinflation Slump,2024-01-31 13:15:00+00:00,4,9UPlQQL2EWE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPlQQL2EWE,i think the thing that's really interesting about what we see in china is china is experiencing a deflationary slump uh and that deflationary slump is something that you know plenty of economies have experienced through time the solution to a deflationary slump is relatively straightforward which is significant monetary and fiscal easing in order to restimulate the economy um and nonetheless what you've seen is that uh that policy makers and particularly the pboc uh but also the central government have chosen not to engage in that stimulation and so what you see here is a very classic set of intermarket action which i think is very interesting which is stocks are falling and basically have been at you know their lows of the last 15 years basically at 15e you know at the same price level as they were 15 years ago bond yields are falling to the lowest level that they've seen in 20 in 15 years all of that is deflationary slump dynamics and and yet you know in an economy where the debt is in their local currency they have a fair amount of flexibility from a government perspective to stimulate fiscally they have a fair amount of of uh ability to stimulate on a monetary basis and so they're just not doing it it's not a matter their conditions are not a matter of circumstance they're a matter of choice and i think if you go under the hood and and look at some of the dynamics that are going on there's really been a centralization a political centralization in particular on the monetary side of uh the pboc historically which had been driven by technocrats western educated technocrats who were implementing monetary policy um in a way that was it maybe not exactly consistent with but informed by uh historical western monetary policy approach approaches and tactics nearly all those people have been removed from the pboc quit or been uh or been shuffled out and instead political appointees have been put in place and so what we're seeing here is a set of choices uh to run a weaker economy i won't aine on the exact reasons why that's above my pay grade in terms of the geopolitical uh decisions that are going on there uh but certainly from a perspective of a macroeconomy p uh view what we're seeing is really a real prioritization of the exchange rate relative to domestic growth circumstances part of that's driven by the fact that there's been such a significant pullback in capital in china that there's an underlying weak set of conditions for the exchange rate and part of it is driven by a focus that exchange rate stability appears to be a primary goal above domestic stimulation the reason why that is is typically what you do in the circumstances you'd ease that easing would lower your currency which would be stimulative uh and support you know your stock market and they're choosing not to do that and if anything you can even see their policy is highly responsive to exactly what's going on with the exchange rat so they by a little bit more liquidity when the exchange rate stabilizes and they highly tighten liquidity domestically when the exchange rate um is facing downward pressure and so china in many ways looks like an economy that is uh and a lot of those hopes that i think uh had been dashed several times over in 2023 i think it's starting you know it's time to recognize that um from a global macroeconomic standpoint probably not worth expecting that china is going to experience a significant uh acceleration in any way that may change we'll keep you know keep an eye on the markets particularly the stock and bond market dynamics but unlikely to change in the future
An Expectations Gap for Fed Cuts,2024-01-30 13:15:00+00:00,3,7HySf80lu6Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HySf80lu6Q,it's certainly going to be challenging for the fed to institute a rapid easing program uh either consistent with what they measure in the scp or what they say in the scp and certainly inconsistent with the extreme cuts that are priced in to the short rate market uh in an environment where inflation remains a bit above what their target is and uh parts of that inflation look pretty sticky and the economy is doing pretty and that's really the challenge that i see here in terms of the pricing which is we basically have a huge gap in expectations that has emerged over the course of the last couple of uh months where uh the macroeconomic conditions would suggest roughly stable monetary policy uh at least for the first the next you know six to 9 months the fed is suggesting that economic conditions may weaken which will cause them to cut interest rates three times over the course of 24 and at its most extreme the financial markets the short rate markets were pricing in between six and seven cuts over the same time frame so there's a big inconsistency between those two points and in particular it is driven by this right tail that you see here on the leand chart which is a very high probability expectation of a lot of cuts coming into the market likely due to the fact that there's going to be expectations of very weak economic conditions and that that's what seems like a low probability event you know the probability that the fed that the economy remains fine and that the fed does little to nothing over the course of 2024 that probability is is baked in at about 10% in terms of the options markets on december 24 short rates about a 10% probability of that whereas the probability that we have a significant recession is priced between 30 and 40% my guess is that the reality of those probabilities is flipped given the macroeconomic circumstances that the possibility that we have enough good enough growth and a modest uh increase in inflation that's sufficient to cause the fed to to be a little more hesitant to cut i'd say is in the 30 to 40% range and the odds that we have a meaningful recession consistent with what's priced in here in terms of hundreds of basis points of cuts in 2024 is probably closer to 10% and so the probabilities of the pricing look flipped relative to the probabilities of the macroeconomic realities
Markets Say the Fed Will Cut 6 or 7 times? Data and History Say Something Different,2024-01-29 13:15:07+00:00,3,xsE7diR0NVw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsE7diR0NVw,the risk you've cited is markets pricing in up to seven rate cuts in 2024 so let's get your perspective on this what are you expecting from the fed are you in the seven camp well i think the odds that we see that magnitude of cuts from the fed uh are pretty low and and the reason why that is is central banks move quickly to respond to growth slowdowns they don't necessarily respond swiftly to inflation moderating uh to around their target and so a lot of the short rate market is expecting the fed to see that lower inflation that stabilizing inflation around 2% uh and quickly cut in response when there really is no urgency uh you know for the from the fed's perspective what they see is they see an unemployment rate at secular lows they see growth above potential and they see inflation that's around their mandate and you put that all together there's no urgency to make any moves let alone cut seven times so bob make it make sense for us here because you would think if the fed does end up having to cut orbe it i i don't believe it'll be seven times but if they do what does that mean about what's happening in the economy that would have led them to cut seven times that the markets are not factoring it well i think anytime the fed quickly cuts interest rates is a time you don't want to be holding stocks and so i think there's a real disconnect between what we see priced in the stock market and what we see pric into the bond market right now stocks are pushing new highs reflecting the fact that there's a strong set of liquidity conditions and the fall in long end rates is actually on the margin stimulative to the us economy and then on the flip side when you look at the bond market uh and particularly the short rate market there's a greater than 30% chance uh that short rates will be below 3% uh in by the end of 2024 currently priced in those two things are totally out of whack the only way in which we're going to see uh interest rates get cut that rapidly is if we have a meaningful growth slowdown and a meaningful growth slowdown like that would be terrible for stocks and so i i think when you look at that mispricing the imbalance of pricing uh looks more incorrect on the bond market side than it does on the equity market side we've seen a few swings of this over the course of the last couple of years where there's continually this expectation that the fed's going to cut the fed's going to cut the fed's going to cut but it never actually transpires because the economy ends up being meaningfully stronger than what people have expected
A Review of the Recent Government Easing,2024-01-28 13:15:00+00:00,3,-wXoi6OQIaI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wXoi6OQIaI,secularly low unemployment so a very tight economy you've got growth that's doing pretty well almost all this data is that we're seeing right now most the vast majority of it is through november not really totally through december uh and uh and you've got inflation which has come down but it's not quite durably at the fed's mandate and what we've had over the course of the last 10 weeks is one of the greatest easing of financial conditions in 40 years typically the magnitude of easing of financial conditions that we've seen in the last 10 weeks would have aligned with periods of time where we bottomed where we experienced cyclical bottoms uh and they were typically uh uh created by central bank easing so the magnitude of easing that we've seen in the last 10 weeks uh a financial conditions we've seen has actually been larger than what we saw in march 2009 the bottoming of the stock market post global financial crisis and back in the 20022 2003 period where we had a bottoming of the us equity market following the tech crash those are the times that we've seen this type of easing what we're seeing today is a very different story which is a huge easing that's occurring in the context of an already tight labor market and an economy that's already operating at capacity and that's a very important dynamic very different dynamic ic than some of those previous cases and so what we see here is significant stimulation stocks are back near highs credit spreads are basically you know uh at the between 10 and 20th percentile of alltime tights you see yields have basically fully reversed 120 basis points um and so have fully reversed where they were the up move that they saw last year and gas prices which are disin inationary impulse but they're also a positive growth impulse because that savings at the pump can go directly to additional spending particularly for high propensity spending cohorts lower income high propensity spending cohorts that's essentially like a stimulus check for many of them the lower gas prices and so you add this all up this is a significant easing of financial conditions in the context of an economy that is already strong and secularly tight
What is an ETF Structure?,2024-01-27 13:15:00+00:00,3,avBaEhYIoes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avBaEhYIoes,there's a structure you know it's been set up so that um for the investor it looks like a stock and has all the properties of an individual stock in terms of uh its tax structuring which means you know typically if you buy it and hold it for more than a year it's taxed at you know your your capital gains rate rather than your ordinary income rate um that's a great tax loophole to have it etfs are also advantaged relative to mutual funds in that they have the ability to wash the capital gain in the securities underneath and so therefore you don't get you i mean in the vast vast vast majority of etfs there are not capital gains distributions even for for products that have moderate turnover there are not capital gains they're typically not capital gains distributions that you see in other funds and so that what that means is you pay the taxes when you want to pay the taxes not when uh the manager you know has has redemptions or when the manager rebalances that's all very advantageous and so it's just and and not to mention the fact that it's transparent and it's liquid and it's a 40ac product you know that's uh ed sec registered and at arms length and you know create has independent custodians and independent board which you know for for hedge funds like you know how many times are you looking at hedge funds and you're saying well you know i mean what's the probability of fraud i'm not saying that there's lots of fraud but that is a thing you have to worry about well if the security in in a etf if the securities are held by an independent institution i don't touch the money right i can't touch the money it's an independent trust that holds the money not me it's an independent trust that you know uh that is highly regulated by the sec that's very advantageous from a consumer standpoint in terms of the risk of fraud or or abuse that comes from a manager yeah i've always felt if you could take your total portfolio whatever however way you invest and put the whole thing inside of a single etf you'd be in great shape because you're basically putting that tax efficient wrapper around this obviously for taxable investors you can put that tax efficient wrapper around the total portfolio obviously that's very complicated not easy to do so short of that you can try to put an etf wrapper around those return streams that mak sense most people think about etfs as um as like lowcost index funds because that's basically how they started but the tax efficiency is actually the best with moderate turnover portfolios u because you don't have to take the capital gains in and out all right you can put those all into a single wrapper and only take you know only basically take the the the the taxes only pay the taxes at the point of sale and so actually the etf structure is more tax efficient better for actively managed strategies than it is even for passively managed strategies was pretty neat
Are Expected Rate Cuts Reasonable?,2024-01-26 23:27:23+00:00,2,2KgIxq1__Nw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KgIxq1__Nw,that that sub 3% what would that do for you in your perspective on the rest of the year because they'll all start to cry about 50 basis point cuts once we get a reasonable level below 3% you can just hear them you know sort of almost like in the football stands crying for 50 basis point cuts at a time but how would you look at a sub three percent print well i think mostly that sub three% print is priced into market expectations and particularly when you look at what's priced into the short rate market in 2024 uh that to seven cuts that are already priced in are reflective of an expectation of a significant moderation in inflation the real question from the fed's perspective is whether or not just getting inflation back down uh to close to their mandate is enough to start to create a substantial cutting cycle particularly when we have a situation where growth is pretty good and asset prices are making new highs plus there's the concern of about break even inflation and long-dated break even inflations starting to rise back up here as asset prices improve and so i think part of the the site the insight that you can get is from the scp which isn't just saying that they're going to cut three times but it's it's reflective or or it it is consistent also with a period of time where unemployment rises to 4.1% so the idea that the fed's going to immediately start cutting if unemployment stays here in the threes growth is pretty good and pce just moves to mandate it's not obvious that they're going to get the sort of cuts that are currently priced into to the short rate market for 24
"Education Gap in Understanding Macro, Investing and Saving",2024-01-26 13:15:06+00:00,5,ryS08Jh_Aj8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryS08Jh_Aj8,and and i'm curious why do you think there's just so much um and maybe you disagree but why do you think there's so much uh misunderstanding about how the economy works how markets work uh you know we're in a world where information is readily available there's probably twoo much information there's probably a lot of noise why why why do you think we're in a place where you know the average investor doesn't have a good grasp of these concepts if uh financial twitter's any indication there's certainly plenty of noise out there so much noise very valuable to uh to you get a lot out of it but there's a lot of noise you have to filter through things i you know i think at it at at its at its core i think there's a real education gap that exists in understanding uh economics and and also i think there's a huge uh education gap in personal finance like we're i mean it's an example like we're teaching young kids about farm animals instead of how you know they should invest their their their their paycheck like that is you know like and 100% of people will have to figure out how to manage their paycheck and you know 1% of the employment in the us is uh in the farming industry and so like that is a fundamental gap that exists in our educational system and so i think um you know the macro econom is hard to be clear lots of things are hard you know writing a good essay is hard um you know understanding uh physics is hard there's lots of different things that are hard but we don't spend time societally in prioritizing a deep br understanding of macroeconomics when it is a thing that affects everyone's lives every single day uh which is kind of incredible in a way that they you you you live your life and you make your personal uh you know your personal decisions when the mortgage rate goes down any person in the market who's thinking about a h buying a house which is you know 2 thir of the people in the us buy you know own houses it affects all of those people uh and yet we don't we don't talk about it and so uh i think that's a real gap and i think um it's particularly a gap that is harmful for those people who don't have access to this information i think you know increasingly it's becoming more available and understandable for you know in various channels but there's still not a good canonical way in which we educate people in the way that we do biology chemistry physics math it doesn't make sense yeah i mean that's one of the reasons i'm doing this podcast is when i when i look at the other information out there i feel like there's just a lot of misinformation it's almost like you you would have been better off not hearing that because it could lead you down the wrong path and and i'm just trying to share some insights that hopefully are helpful to investors yeah it's it's a it's just such a fascinating field you know if you think about you know the average person they have to work really hard to earn money and then they take that money and they put it in some investment you know to sa for retirement or you know down the road and and you know all that hard work could be wasted on investing inefficiently which when i look at kind of the the average person it their portfolio is really out of balance it's basically you know one bet and it's just uh it's kind of overly risky and it doesn't have to be that way i totally agree and and it's how they alloc how you allocate your savings and then also all the different steps all the ways in which you can allocate savings like all the planning aspects which are so crit i mean so so critical to getting the best outcome that you can and a place where you know if you ask the average personent the street like what do you do uh in what's the most efficient way to save your money it is not obvious right we're not we don't have these conversations um with the everyday you know the everyday person about how best to save how best to structure it how best to create a great portfolio all of those things um you know it there there's a huge gap in terms of the education it's the role the i mean the great thing is there's also tons of advisers out there who really understand this stuff well and and are um are out there trying to educate their clients and put them in the best position so i think there's a there's a there's a a great force for good that's out there uh to do this in a in a better way but there's still a huge gap between what the man on the street understands and and what and and what is actually available to them and and how to best implement a portfolio
Cash vs Beta vs Alpha,2024-01-25 13:15:05+00:00,5,nP5NvIdUbwo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP5NvIdUbwo,you think of the world as there's beta and there's alpha so there are returns that are uh risk premium that you collect by holding risky assets so this is kind of buy and hold you have a positive expected return and then there are trades that you can make and and you know in a moment we'll get into your market views um but maybe just quickly summarize uh that distinction between the source of returns and then how you think about balancing those two in a well diversified portfolio when it comes down to it can generate returns from three different sources there's cash the cash rate you know essentially the central banks set what that is you you get it for free uh and with no risk uh in t- bills and stuff like that there's beta as you say passive investing uh and over time you'd expect uh you'd expect assets to outperform cash and the reason why that is is that the sort of fundamental construct of markets is that you forgo the riskless cash return to hand your money to someone whether it's to lend or to invest and you would expect a higher return as a result than holding cash and it's a reason why if you look back through time you know very very rarely over meaningful periods of time do does cash outperform assets in fact you know over i mean over any one year time frame over any 12-month time frame uh you know it's like 7030 that that assets outperform cash and so um the choice to overweight cash is actually an alpha choice and you have to be darn good at that timing in order to actually have conviction that you should overweight cash since so often assets outperform cash and then the last choice as you say is making bets in markets and when you think about a portfolio you want to think about each one of those different pieces in a different way first of all you want to think about your overall risk tolerance i mean we talked about uh we talked about you know can you absorb 75 or 50% draw downs in your portfolio um or say for instance you're getting close to retirement and you really want a lot of conviction about exactly you know how much capital you have for retirement and so that sort of gives you the sense of what's the choice between cash and assets right the amount of risk that you're willing to take in order to generate in order to generate returns and excessive cash and so that's different for every individual and you know you just want to think about that thoughtfully and proactively to target your return and then when you think about assets the real question is how much do you want to put in uh in passive investing versus active investing and there's an important tradeoff there which is you know passive investing generally has lower expected returns particularly relative to the risk that you're taking uh but it's more consistent right more more reliable you would expect assets to outperform cash over time whereas alpha you have the opport opportunity probably to get a better return relative to the risk that you're taking but the reliability is lower and so how do you balance these things i mean the frank reality is there's no obvious way to do it because you have to take into consideration a a variety of different things including how reliable you think one is versus the other how much skill you think managers have i think if you look at big institutional managers they're allocating something like 80% of their capital to beta in one form or another whether it's liquid or liquid and about 20 % of their capital to alpha strategies and i think that basically is about right um in the sense of you know in general beta strategies are going to give you you know pretty good consistent return so you really want to rely on that uh but alpha can help protect portfolios uh gen you know particularly in in difficult times and so you want to put something on it but you don't want to go overweight it so something like 8020 makes sense which you know is the answer to every uh it's either 8020 or 5050 those are the answers to all life's waiting questions yeah that sounds about right and then i guess it's also you know alpha is a zero sum game it's a negative sum game if you add fees you know in a lot of cases uh maybe the the managers can generate alpha they can outperform but they take that in fees and and the investors don't get as much as uh as they might otherwise so i think you have to weigh that as well you know and passive investing just you know heading to zero in terms of cost right and fees like the the biggest issue for an investor is fees and the reason why that is is alpha is uncertain fees are certain right what whatever the fee is you know what that that management fee certain that pass through let me tell you it's certain and it's big
What is Systematic Investing?,2024-01-22 13:15:04+00:00,3,pavCi13my_w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pavCi13my_w,it's really about developing that sort of fundamental understanding of how the markets work and it's not you know i think people can think about systematic investing and they can say they can think oh well it's you know right computer rules and they sort of you know drive you wherever you go it's less about that and more about understanding and thinking that there are fundamental cause effect drivers that drive the outcomes that we're seeing and that you know those are not necessarily static there are ways of thinking about it and and there are certain elements that are consistent over time but that system is constantly evolving and so you can't just say well i you know for instance i trade stocks using the yield curve right sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't you know in the last 15 months or you know it hasn't yield curve inversion hasn't been a very good indicator of stops you know and so you can't just take those things things on the face value you have to constantly rigorously assess but the foundation is that there are fundamental drivers that are driving markets economies where they were and where they're going and if you can understand those those fundamental drivers in a way that is better than other participants in the market then you have a better view of what's likely to transpire and you can reflect that view in markets so i'm curious do you say it's a fair assessment to conclude that there are no certainties or very few certainties there's just it's probabilistic right is is that how you think about it part of the lessons from being a macro investor is the humility of getting a lot of things wrong um you know in in baseball if you hit over 300 you know you go to the hall of fame in macro if you can be 5248 on you know trades in any given month uh that'll make you one of the best investors in the world and so that gives you a sense as to just how hard it is and so a lot of what you're doing in terms of if you're trying to generate alpha in from a macro perspective is you're trying to get some edge right you're trying to get that marginal edge and then try and bet that edge over and over and over again so you have large sample size so you can create you know more consistent returns because you know anytime any macro commentator like go you know watch cnbc someone says stocks are going to go up stocks are going to go down you know that's a 5248 kind of bet and so given that given that edge is so hard to develop what you want to do is you want to under create that edge but then you also want to bet it and that's part of what systemization is really valuable for which is it doesn't it it both allows you to have sort of these fundamental cause effect sort of rules in terms of how the world is working but it also is scalable and allows you to apply that understanding more broadly across markets and and in a disciplined way so you can get the most out of your edge
The Effect of Fed and Treasury Policy Shifts,2024-01-21 13:15:06+00:00,5,zPentham1TI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPentham1TI,bob the last time we had you on the the show we discussed the road map to a recession and one of the sort of key discussions ahead of a recession is whether interest rates are sufficiently tied to actually create that recession given what we've seen in fixed income space over the course of the past quarter or so do you find the likelihood of a recession to be much lower than the last time with we talked with you yeah i i think the the main i one of the last time we talked we talked a lot about what was the what were the policies going to be in particular what was the treasury policy going to be and then also you know what what what were fed policies going to be and and how are they going to transpire and i think what we've seen is we've seen in part because of a shift in stance and in part because of an extrapolation a big shift in the expectations of future policy and those interest rates which had been you know had been starting to create some those elevated interest rates had started to create some weight on asset prices which was necessary to start to slow the economy down those have come off we've had 120 basis points move in the bond yield we've had equity prices move up considerably over the course of the last you know 10 weeks you put those things together and we're sort of we've taken a step back relative to the path that maybe we were on through the end of october it looks a lot more like we're back to where we were frankly in early 23 conditions look very similar to where we were in early 23 a lot more similar there than they were in october let's say and so what that means is the timing the dynamics the ordering all of that remains the same it's just we step backwards and so that means the odds that we get to a recessionary environment uh are further out but the mechanics are still the same and that's really important which means we're only going to get there we're only going to get to the slowing of the economy with another rise in bond yields which then starts to bring equity prices down which starts to kick off the slowdown in the economy and so the ordering matters eventually we'll get to recession at some point but we won't get there until we get back to the meaningful bond yield rise that we had started to see through the end of october so pairing this with positioning out there bob um is the pain tra still high interest rates from here i think so i mean in a lot of ways what we've seen is uh a a big flood particularly in the last couple of months into the bond market again on those expectations that we were you know that the yields looked good and that the recession was coming and so where is the pain here particularly in the bond market i should say the bond market pain is essentially nothing changes uh and we get you know an unwinding of that pricing remember there's still something like a 70% probability of of a cut priced into the march uh short rate curve i mean where where where is the data that supports where is the evidence that supports a 70% probability of a cut in march the economy would have to essentially instantaneously fall off a cliff for that to make a ton of sense for the fed to do and that's just the start of the overall expectations that are going on in that market so the pain trade for bonds is basically nothing happens in terms of the macroeconomy we keep chugging along i think the pain for stocks is a little bit different um where uh you know growth expectations are still elevated in stocks probably not so elevated that fine growth outcomes won't allow for continued modest rises in stock market really there for stocks the pain is a meaningful economic contraction or decline which as i say it seems like a low probability event given the distribution of of things that we're seeing in the in the macroeconomy
Is the U.S. Economy Stronger for Longer?,2024-01-20 13:15:04+00:00,2,t5QZCmw_HmE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QZCmw_HmE,with your thesis of stronger for longer so fill us in on this thesis uh of on the us economy what happens if nothing happens right that's right that's right i mean i i think one of the things when you're trading when you're trading macro markets you're you're trading differential probabilities and so i think what you want to look at when you're thinking about where there are good trade opportunities is where you see certain things that are priced in a way that are meaningfully different from the probability that that might transpire and so right now as you mentioned as you look at the uh at the fed funds pricing the options implied distribution of 2024 pricing there's basically only a 10% chance priced in that we have you know zero or one rate cuts by the fed over the course of 24 and when you think about that uh and i should say and there's something like a one-third chance that we're going to have more than 200 basis points of cuts priced in and when you look at the actual underlying economic data what you see is that you know growth is pretty good we just got the biggest easing of financial conditions uh over the course of two months in the last 40 years if anything timely growth measures are showing a bit of acceleration and so when i think about those the balance of the probabilities i'd say it's much more likely that there's sort of a 30 or 40% chance that we have a fine 2024 and the fed doesn't do a whole lot relative to the 10% pricing versus you know a deep deep recession which is priced at 30 or 40% in terms of the distribution of the market when the probability looks closer to 10% to me and that's that's the those are the sorts of trades that that open up in the macro environment that are that are good risk return trades that you want to you want to put on bob the last time we
Unlimited Macro Webinar 2024 Outlook,2024-01-19 13:15:01+00:00,51,Ph6cg0Jyfr0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph6cg0Jyfr0,"[music] for many folks uh there's a lot of crosscutting uh different pieces of information that are out there in terms of what's going on and so while often uh it makes sense to get in down into the nuts and bolts of all the individual pieces to really build that rich understanding and perspective about what's going on i think in this sort of circumstance it's also important to sort of take a step back and start to think about what are sort of the key aggregate ways of looking at what's going on in the economy and the reason why that is is because when you have an environment of a lot of crosscutting things you can pick information that points you in one direction you can find other information that points you in another direction those of you who follow fin twit regularly that is a very common occurrence as people picking out particulars that might support one particular narrative or another and what i'm going to try and do here at least at the outset is to really sort of bring it all together because those comprehensive views those comprehensive looks in terms of what's going on in the macroeconomy i think are really useful in synthesizing where we are today and where we're likely to go so the basic starting point which in some ways is the simplest is what's going on with the economy and the short answer is the economy uh in aggregate is doing fine uh and has been doing fine for really a few years now on the leftand side here what you see is you see us real gdp growth uh and what you see is a series of of a number of quarters here where us real gdp has printed uh pretty good pretty good uh outcomes uh including up to including the fourth quarter estimate which depending on exactly which measures you you look at what you see is something a bit above 2% the most recent atlanta fed gdp now right around just between two and two and a half percent and what that means is we've basically had a period of at or above potential growth uh really for several quarters now uh and it makes sense that in that context what we see over here on the right hand side is an unemployment rate that is both at secular lows and has basically been stable for 18 months uh in the you know three and a half to 4% range and so what does that overall picture look like that's a picture of an economy that on a backward-looking basis is doing pretty well uh growing enough in order to keep labor markets tight and growing enough in order to uh keep unemployment low now there are some consequences for that and i think it's important to recognize what that strength in the economy is leading to and in particular how much strength is necessary particularly when you think about job growth in order to keep labor markets tight the job market uh and the employment in the us is very different today than it was in the ' 08 cycle and in the late 90s cycle and the reason why that is is the overall labor force growth in the economy is much much lower today than it was in those previous cycles so whereas you know job gains say payrolls numbers of 200 or 300 were really necessary to continue to tighten the labor markets back in those previous cycles what we see today is it doesn't take much more than about 50 basis points of employment growth in order to keep the labor market tight and that's what you see over here on the left hand side is comparing the job growth which has slowed down uh but it's not that weak all things considered and particularly not that weak relative to uh the labor force growth and there's lots of different ways that you can think about this but the gist is that you know if we see unemployment if we see payrolls prints that are around 100,000 a month that's 1.2 million jobs created a year that's about 75 basis points of employment growth that is even that is enough to keep labor markets tight and so there's a reason why we're seeing that unemployment rate the way that it is staying at that low level is is that you know with basically at potential growth despite the fact that it might look like employment is softer than what you've seen in previous cycles and that's because the rate that is necessary to keep the economy tight is so much lower and the function of that the consequence of that of these tight labor markets continues to be that wage growth remains elevated relative to where it was in the preco period and so that's what you see over here on the right hand side this is the atlanta fed uh wage tracker uh it's a particularly useful tracker because what it does is it lops off the very rich people who have high high propensity to save incremental income and it matches between one job holder matches uh job holders through time to ensure that you're getting a good picture of actual individual uals and their wage growth and what you see here is really it's it stabilized right around between five and 5 and a half% uh this chart is actually not updated for the data that was releas released late yesterday which showed a small uptick uh in in this number on the monthly year-over-year numbers and so all of that pointing to the fact that we have wage growth that's elevated and and i think important to contextualize it relative to the preco wage growth that was going on which was running kind of three to four along this measure whereas today we're running sort of five to five and a half and that pickup in wage growth is uh is is reflection of the combination of the fact that we had an inflationary impulse and so real wages are catching up people are negotiating higher wages given the higher level of prices in the economy and it also reflects the fact that um that the labor market is very tight uh and so uh while it's you know it's it's gone from what i i like to say is scorching hot in 2022 uh to something that's a bit more uh sec just just secularly tight uh it's tight enough to keep pressure on wages to continue to grow we've had a again just to take a step back and and make sure we don't get lost in all the particulars of these different dynamics so strong you know at potential or a bit better growth unemployment and labor conditions secularly tight getting wage growth that's elevated relative to the most recent cycle and inflation which has moderated to some extent but is highly reliant on a number of large disinflationary pressures to continue to print at a pace that's close to the fed's target now if you go out and you know read a lot of commentary there's a lot of folks who are highlighting that inflation is now back at the fed's mandate and therefore the cuts will come and i'd emphasize that that that both the reader and also the fed will be careful about necessarily being certain that we've entered a totally different inflation regime than we had over the course of the last couple of years and the reason why that is is that inflation has moderated considerably due to an unwinding of many of the supply chain pressures that had caused its pop over time what that means is as the prices have gone from rising rapidly to flattening to falling that's created a disinflationary impulse into the aggregate price increases in the economy in order for that disinflationary impulse to persist which is necessary in order for inflation to remain uh at about 2% those price falls would have to continue at the same pace and so if you look at sort of two representative examples uh which is is highlighted by the uh the breakdown on the right hand side a big part of why we've seen on the headline numbers a moderation of inflation is a function of a relatively rapid decline in gasoline prices if you look you know if you go back uh last summer or two summers ago you know gas was at five it fell to three and a half popped up to four and really in the last 10 weeks it's gone from four to three uh dollars a gallon on a blended average basis that is a big disinflationary impulse which is helping bring down inflation directly in terms of how it's measured but in other places as it passes through but in order for that pressure to persist that disinflationary impulse to persist what you have to have is you have to have gas prices keep falling at that same rate well a dollar a gallon you know every 10 weeks is not going to persist for for forever by any stretch and we've started to see some stabilization so that disinflationary impulse is behind us not ahead of us similarly we've seen a big shift particularly in durable goods prices which had risen considerably as a function of supply chain shocks that has shifted over the course of the last year where those price rises that emerged during the postco period have now started to decline that decline has led to negative price growth in those particular products think of things like used autos and what we're at and what you can see in this blue line here is that we're now at a level of deflation or deflation in these products that is equivalent to the to the significant deflation that we saw during the globalization and china manufacturing period in uh in the 2000s now will that persist in order for inflation to remain again at 2% which is where it's been recently that rate of deflation would have to persist well into the future and i think there's good reasons to believe that uh that level of deflation might not be persistent both on a short-term basis as we've seen some supply chain issues emerge uh the the fed the new york fed's measure of supply chain pressures went from meaningfully contracting meaning getting a lot better fast sort of neutral and so that gives you a good sense of the aggregate dynamics across a lot of different products and of of course we've seen emerging uh issues related to supply change that that have come on as a function of the geopolitical tensions in the middle east which have caused an extension of shipping costs uh it's shipping times and shipping costs both of which are meaningfully inflationary particularly on this area which is durable goods and goods that has been so critically important to creating that move down in headline inflation and inflation to roughly the fed's mandate and so what's offsetting that is this underlying structural dynamic which is which connects to the labor markets and to the to the challenges the tightness in in in housing which is you know housing costs and housing related costs continue to rise a big reason why that is is that despite the fact that new asking rents have moderated their growth rate from being elevated to close to zero the v majority of tenants are rolling their rental costs which are still elevated contractually agreed upon and still elevated relative to zero and housing costs are definitely rising as house prices have now returned to rising uh between 0.5 and 1% uh a month and so you've got that part of the story where we were not quite getting the moderation and housing costs that you might have hoped for or might think is occurring if you just look at those asking rents and then of course underlying this is also traditional services that are driven by employment and wage growth and that that area that the fed has highlighted regularly which is that core services x housing continues to print numbers that should be disconcerting for the fed in the five to six perc range that's in line with wage growth and most importantly has actually shown some acceleration in the most recent period and so if you get a situation where you no longer get that disinflationary impulse from oil prices and no longer get that disinflationary impulse from goods prices particularly durable goods prices and you still have those underlying structural inflationary pressures that exist from a tight labor market and elevated wage growth and housing costs you could easily have a circumstance where what happens is inflation moves from where it is right now which is you looks for a moment like it's consistent with the fed's target to have that moderate up over the course of the year to something between three and 4% which would be a significant concern for the fed and well outside of making the case that inflation has moderated to uh to their target so in that context just again if you take step back secularly low unemployment so a very tight economy you've got growth doing pretty well almost all this data is that we're seeing right now most the vast majority of it is through november not really totally through december uh and uh and you've got inflation which has come down but it's not quite durably at the feds mandate and what we've had over the course of the last 10 weeks is one of the greatest easing of financial conditions in 40 years typically the magnitude of easing of financial conditions that we've seen in the last 10 weeks would have aligned with periods of time where we bottomed where we experienced cyclical bottoms uh and they were typically uh uh created by central bank easing so the magnitud of easing that we've seen in the last 10 weeks uh of financial conditions we've seen has actually been larger than what we saw in march 2009 the bottoming of the stock market post global financial crisis and back in the 20022 3 period where we had a bottoming of the us equity market following the tech crash those are the times that we've seen this type of easing what we're seeing today is a very different story which is a huge easing that's occurring in the context of an already tight labor market and an economy that's already operating at capacity and that's a very important dynamic very different dynamic than some of those previous cases and so what we see here is signific ific stimulation stocks are back near highs credit spreads are basically you know uh at the between 10 and 20th percentile of alltime tights you see yields have basically fully reversed 120 basis points um and so have fully reversed where they were the up move that they saw last year and gas prices which are disinflationary impulse but they're also a positive growth impulse because that savings at the can go directly to additional spending particularly for high propensity spending cohorts lower income high propensity spending cohorts that's essentially like a stimulus check for many of them the lower gas prices and so you add this all up this is a significant easing of financial conditions in the context of an economy that is already strong and secularly tight and what we're seeing in response to that significant ease in is if you squint at the most timely data which um which you know is important to to to do to try and see whether we're actually getting a responsiveness to this change in conditions i think what you see here is you start you're starting to see various corners of the economy start to pick up uh if you look over in the housing market we've seen a significant decline from you know in the eights mortgage rates in the eights to in the in the lower sixes that's been an important stimulative effect for the housing market we've seen some improvement in sentiment there and we've also seen a pickup in mortgage applications in line with that and when i say a pickup what i mean is uh mortgage applications had been slowing considerably relative to you know hotter periods but what's actually happening there is we're seeing a slower rate of contraction and for instance the mortgage applications that were printed earlier this week looked on par with 2016 uh basically the same time of the year in 2016 whereas they had tracked considerably below those 2016 measures in previous uh over the course of 2023 and so that slowing of the contraction is a positive growth impulse is showing that the economy is responding to the lower mortgage rates we're also if you squint at the employment data and of course you know many of you know a lot about my many of you read my weekly uh my weekly uh tweets about the fact that the us labor market is secularly tight um i think if you if you squint at that data i think it actually suggests the possibility that we're seeing an improving set of conditions in the labor market over the last 8 to 10 weeks you see continuing claims relative to similar dates in previous in recent years starting to moderate uh and you're seeing initial claims which have come down a fair amount and are basically at the lows of the last two years all of that points to the fact that we are starting to get some reacceleration of the economy in response to this easing and that comes from a base that was already growing at above potential turning our attention to then what's priced in the market so that's the story in the economy you add that all up and what i'd say is there's a pretty good possibility right now uh that at least in the first half of 2024 we're going to have a a pretty good economy you know pretty pretty decent um and and that is uh through the combination of the underlying momentum uh the wage growth the stronger asset prices supporting financial conditions supporting activity and continuing uh the path here of elevated you know elevated growth at a time when unemployment remains relatively low we don't see any indication that we've that there's been a meaningful deterioration in employment conditions and so you put that together that's a pretty good growth outlook for 20 for for the first half of 2024 and then you turn around and look at the market pricing and what you see is uh a shift to significant cuts being priced in to the as to to the short rate market and uh on the left hand side what you see is you see the distribution of different outcomes at different periods so by june the modal expectation is for you know somewhere between two or three cuts and then uh you know and then by the end of december 2024 you have a pricing which suggests uh greater than 25% probability of interest rates below 3% actually it's um it's about a 35% probability that there'll be at least 200 basis points of cuts or more those are all aligned i think what i'd say when you look at that is that that is pretty terrible economic conditions that are priced in to those rate markets now folks will point out the fact that uh the moderation of inflation and the fed has talked a fair amount about thinking about real rates as a way to think about the tightness of monetary policy and they'll highlight that because we're seeing moderating inflation the fed may choose to cut interest rates as a result in order to keep the real rate neutral and there was some indication of that through some various governor's comments as well as in the press conference in the last couple meetings but what i'd highlight and and and many folks point to the scp as an indication of their intention to cut with three cuts uh noted or expected on the median dot in the scp by the december 2024 but i think it's really important to recognize what is in that sep is not just the planned monetary policy actions but a set of economic conditions that connect with those monetary policy actions and what that suggests is that um is that unemployment the unemployment rate those cuts will only come or those cuts will come at a time when we see a meaningful weakening of the unemployment rate to the low fours to 4.1% so it's not three cuts if growth continues to strengthen and and continues to be strong if unemployment remains stable or even falls that's not what how you're going to get three cuts you're get three cuts if there's a meaningful deterioration in economic conditions and so that's an important interplay when you look at what's going on with economic conditions you see there's not a lot of indication that there will be a meaningful softening in the short term if anything what the indications are are for a bit of acceleration here in the first part of the year and at the same time a lot of cuts are priced in adding further pressure to this you know we we've seen the cpi report this morning as we taped this uh another core print that was in the 0.31 range uh which is you know implies an annual inflation rate annual core inflation rate measured by cpi between 3 and 4% it's certainly going to be challenged in for the fed to institute a rapid easing program uh either consistent with what they measure in the scp or what they say in the scp and certainly inconsistent with the extreme cuts that are priced in to the short rate market uh in an environment where inflation remains a bit above what their target is and uh parts of that inflation look pretty sticky and the economy is doing pretty well and that's really the challenge that i see here in terms of the pricing which is we basically have a huge gap in expectations that has emerged over the course of the last couple of uh months where uh the macroeconomic conditions would suggest roughly stable monetary policy uh at least for the first the next you know six to nine months the fed is suggesting that economic conditions may weaken which will cause them to cut interest rates three times over the course of 24 and at its most extreme the financial markets the short rate markets were pricing in between six and seven cuts over the same time frame so there's a big inconsistency between those two points and in particular it is driven by this right tail that you see here on the leand chart which is a very high probability expectation of a lot of cuts coming in into the market likely due to the fact that there's going to be expectations of very weak economic conditions and that that's what seems like a low probability event like i wrote today on on my uh twitter feed you know the probability that the fed that the economy remains fine and that the fed does little to nothing over the course of 2024 that probability is is baked in at about 10% in terms of the options markets on december 24 short rates about a 10% probability of that whereas the probability that we have a significant recession is priced between 30 and 40% my guess is that the reality of those probabilities is flipped given the macroeconomic circumstances that the possibility that we have enough good enough growth and a modest uh increase in inflation that's sufficient to cause the fed to to be a little more hesitant to cut i'd say is in the 30 to 40% range and the odds that we have a meaningful recession consistent with what's priced in here in terms of hundreds of basis points of cuts in 2024 is probably closer to 10% and so the probabilities of the pricing look flipped relative to the probabilities of the macroeconomic realities we're also seeing a circumstance where uh on the long end we're seeing a weakening of growth getting priced in as well you can often look at uh stocks relative to bonds to get a good understanding of what's expected for economic growth conditions and i think one of the things that's been very interesting since the significant policy changes that occurred in early november is that the bond market has rallied relative to the stock market risk matched on a risk matched basis and so that's important to think about because we've essentially had the greatest financial easing uh in 40 years over the course of that 10 weeks and yet the in market action is such that it's uh it's implying that stocks are going to that that growth forward-looking growth conditions are likely to be worse than before that easing not better that's what you see here with bonds outperforming stocks or stocks underperforming bonds the types of conditions that we're seeing today with that easing and the strong growth and the pricing that's that's currently in the market should typically lead to stocks outperforming bonds just think about it what happened in march 2009 what happened in uh in the spring of 2003 uh what happened in those circumstances when we had these huge financial easings these financial market easings is that stocks subsequently meaningfully out performed bonds as the economy accelerated and so that's the dynamic that i would expect to see similarly what we're seeing over here in the internals of the equity market we did see uh some compression uh in the uh least loved areas of the market particularly the small caps relative to the large caps and know these small caps are the most sensitive to these pickup to this pickup in liquidity conditions but i note that that after a a a a reasonable part of the driving of that was a number of uh hedge funds which experienced a short squeeze as there was some sector rotation uh and size rotation that since the start of the year has actually moderated considerably and so if you compare where we are today on the russell 2k versus s&p 500 versus where we were before this easing started only 3% of the nearly 15% % gap in return in 2023 has closed between those two through the beginning of this year that really creates an opportunity typically you should see small caps and the most liquidity sensitive stocks in the economy improve as a function of the significant easing of financial conditions and odds are as that increasingly gets recognized we'll be seeing a factor rotation that again is towards stocks in aggregate relative to bonds and also towards the riskiest part of the equity market and away from those segments of the of the market that have that were the primary drivers of outperformance in 2023 overall i want to contextualize this because i think um we can get sucked into the particulars of the market pricing and the economic conditions today and and can lose sight of essentially the way in which the market is operating and that has shifted considerably over the course of the last uh couple of years for a long time particularly post gfc the way to make money in the market was to uh get on the get quickly on the turn or the trend identify those quickly and get in and then take a lot of risk when you had that opportunity and so that made a lot of sense when in particular when fed liquidity conditions were the primary driers shifts in fed liquidity conditions were the primary drivers of what was going on with financial market performance but what's going on today is very different in many ways the fed is uh is not particularly influential in what's happening uh and what's happening instead is that the macroeconomy is very very very slowly moving as it typically does and what's happening is that expectations of what's likely to transpire in the macroeconomy are whipping around hugely relative to the reality if you go to that first chart and i just showed you that and i said what do you think's going on with this economy an economy that's seen you know six seven eight quarters of roughly at potential growth you'd say like not much seems pretty boring but uh trading markets and particularly trading short rates has been anything but boring over the course of the last couple years and the reason why that is is from these huge moves in expectations outsized moves and expectations from folks who are trying to identify the turn when the reality is there is no turn the economy is just meandering along like it typically does and so i like to look at this chart and just sort of think about all the different stages that we've seen over the course of the last uh the last sort of 15 months from immediate recession to start 23 to higher for longer to a credit crisis to the productivity miracle of course to higher even higher for longer to the treasury easing and now to the expectation that recession is coming and deflation is upon us those are huge wild swings in the markets that haven't equated to the changes that are going on in the real economy and i think particularly entering this year and and a bit of this has closed over the course of the last couple weeks but we still have a ways to go we're seeing another one of those extreme market pricing instances uh where expectations are relatively extreme uh compared to the reality and where in all of these circumstances your best bet was to fade the extreme pricing and we're seeing another one of those circumstances again today that basically sums it up for the us i'm going to do a quick run through of what's going on in the rest of the world because i think there's some interest observations before i get to the audience questions i think in many ways europe is the exact opposite of the us in the sense of uh inflation has moderated considerably that's what you see in this upper right chart that moderation of inflation has now brought core uh and headline inflation basically between one and 2% which is where the the ecb's mandate is their sole mandate um we've seen a significant slowing of economic condition s where we've seen probably six months of negative gdp growth uh if you take a bottoms up perspective from the underlying data and don't wait for the actual gdp report that's what it's looking like here in the second half of the year and yet the amount of of easing that's priced in to the european curve is the same exact amount of easing that's priced into the us curve now think about that you've got two economies that have radically different different outcomes one which has secularly tight conditions inflation that is still a bit above what the central bank's mandate is and growth that's above potential and and it just experienced a huge easing and you' got another economy where inflation is below the central bank's target and where growth is contracting to totally different environments and yet the same pricing and i think that creates a very interesting opportunity from a diff perspective uh the uk is another example uh of this as well pricing in basically the same amount of cuts as in the us and as in europe i think it falls nicely in between the two where growth conditions are weaker uh but there's still inflationary pressures and so uh you have a central bank that um in many ways is not even thinking about uh thinking about thinking about easing uh if you look at what their most recent votes are uh and so i think it's another case where the idea that the bank of england is going to cut anywhere near as much as the ecb over the course of 2024 seems improbable given the set of conditions that are in the uk relative to the set of conditions that are in the euro zone japan totally different story here um has uh we've we've we talked basically nine months ago for those of you follow me on twitter uh about the shift in uh central bank leadership and whether that would create a significant change in monetary policy since then the bank of japan has done a couple of tweaks of their yield curve control measures uh but has not significantly shifted their policy stance which is one that is incredibly easy uh over time and if anything that is increasingly making sense for them to not shift any further as what we see is that the inflation measures uh have come down considerably over there on the leftand side is the core inflation which is printed you know in the one to two per range over the course of the last uh couple of months we saw the same with a tokyo cpi number that came out earlier this week as well as the uh wage growth numbers which were printing at zero year-over-year none of that from an inflation perspective suggests an inflation problem or an urgency to tighten and at the same time we've seen some moderation in growth particularly driven by some of the weaker demand circumstances in asia and so that's what you see over there on the right hand side is negative gdp growth low inflation this is not an economy that where it makes sense to to tighten anything yet 65 basis points of tightening are priced in to the short end in japan in 2024 the odds that that happened given the set of conditions seem very low and finally i'll end with china um which you know as the world's second largest economy uh doesn't probably get talked about nearly enough uh relative to its global macroeconomic importance um and so we at least have to touch on what's going on with it uh to understand it from a from a global macro perspective even if the individual markets aren't necessarily what you're trading on a day-to-day basis and i think the thing that's really interesting about what we see in china is china is experiencing a deflationary slump and that deflationary slump is something that you know plenty of economies have experienced through time the solution to a deflationary slump is relatively straightforward which is significant monetary and fiscal easing in order to restimulate the economy um and nonetheless what you've seen is that uh that policy makers and particularly the pboc uh but also the central government have chosen not to engage in that stimulation and so what you see here is a very classic set of intermarket action which i think is very interesting which is stocks are falling and basically have been at you know their lows of the last 15 years basically at 15e you know at the same price level as they were 15 years ago bond yields are falling to the lowest level that they've seen in 20 in 15 years all of that is deflationary slump dynamics and and yet you know in in a economy where the debt is in their local currency they have a fair amount of flexibility from a government perspective to stimulate fiscally they have a fair amount of of uh ability to stimulate on a monetary basis and so they're just not doing it it's not a matter their conditions are not a matter of circumstance they're a matter of choice and i think if you go under the hood and and look at some of the dynamics that are going on there's really been a centralization a political centralization in particular particular on the monetary side of uh the pboc historically which had been driven by technocrats western educated technocrats who were implementing monetary policy um in a way that was it maybe not exactly consistent with but informed by uh historical western monetary policy approaches and tactics nearly all those people have been removed from the pboc quit or been uh or been shuffled out and instead political poes have been put in place and so what we're seeing here is and there's a good ft article about that which i sent out earlier this week and so what we're seeing here is a set of choices uh to run a weaker economy i won't aine on the exact reasons why that's above my pay grade in terms of the geopolitical uh decisions that are going on there uh but certainly from a perspective of a macroeconomy p uh view what we're seeing is really a real prioritization of the exchange rate relative to domestic growth circumstances part of that's driven by the fact that there's been such a significant pullback in capital in china that there's an underlying weak set of conditions for the exchange rate and part of it is driven by uh focus that exchange rate stability appears to be a primary goal above domestic stimulation and the reason why that is is typically what you do in the circumstances you'd ease that easing would lower your currency which would be stimulative uh and support you know your stock market and they're choosing not to do that and if anything you can even see their policy is highly responsive to exactly what's going on with the exchange rate so they provide a little bit more liquidity when the exchange rate stabilizes and they highly tighten liquidity domestically when the exchange rate um is facing downward pressure and so china in many ways looks like an economy that is stuck uh and a lot of those hopes that i think uh had been dashed several times over in 2023 i think it's starting you know it's time to recognize that um from a global macroeconomic standpoint probably not worth expecting that china is going to experience a significant uh acceleration in any way that may change we'll keep you know keep an eye on the markets particularly the stock and bond market dynamics but unlikely to change in the future that pretty much wraps up the outlook uh we'll hit a couple of audience questions here that al took a little bit longer than i was expecting so um we'll try to get to as many questions as i can i'll go a little over the top of the hour uh and uh appreciate anyone who wants to stick around uh let's get to some of these questions that came in before and then you know for folks who have uh questions that have come chuck them into that q&a i'll i'll try to uh manage this live um there's a number of questionss we received uh that uh had to do with uh the the qra um and the expected qra policy uh qra for those who uh are unfamiliar is the quarterly refunding announcement uh made by the treasury uh uh and what that what that means is basically uh is the uh quarterly policy in which the treasury uh announces how much it's going to borrow and the profile of that borrowing in the past this was not very interesting since deficits were known and the profile of the debt was primarily driven by technocrats who defined exactly what uh what they wanted to do you know there's a set of rules in terms of what that debt next should look like that changed really significantly on november 1 when you know janet yellen went out who's the secretary of the treasury went outside those expectations uh and meaningfully cut back the amount of duration issuance relative to expectations which was in part a driver uh of the rebound in in asset markets that we saw in november and and december i think i'd emphasize that um what she chooses to do for her next policy announcement in terms of how to finance the extremely large deficits that the us is experiencing is unknown uh it is extraordinarily uncertain and i' i'd say you know this is probably uh the the point in time the biggest point in time in my career where we've seen a real ambiguity about what the policy uh the the the policy decisions and the reaction function is from such a critical influence on the asset markets the the reason why that is is janet yellen has an incredible amount of flexibility in terms of what she could do the size of the debt profile the size of the debt means that you know issue in any one quarter or couple of quarters doesn't make any difference um in terms of the overall debt profile she could go to 100% bills or increase her coupon issuance and it largely wouldn't make a difference in terms of the overall debt profile in the short term so it's up to her and it's up to a person sitting in a political uh circumstance and political position to make this decision what will she do is very hard to know uh and very uncertain i think there's reasonable cases to be made that she'll be swayed by the technocrats and reasonable reasons to believe that she'll uh use it as a tool of political influence to try and simulate the economy but i think for most people what's better to do than speculate on a on a leading basis is to get the report read it understand well what the implications are and position for it and for those of you know those folks who did that in the november 1 meeting uh there were something there was something like eight weeks of rally in stocks and bonds that could that uh that you could take that you could have uh if you had positioned at 8:30 in the morning on november 1st so i think that's probably the best thing to do rather than to speculate on what's likely um a couple of questions here uh about the balance sheet in particular why they are suggesting that they're going to taper uh quantitative tightening prematurely and whether the liquidity trends in the rrp facility are important to think about uh as a reminder um when you know the the fed can take in deposits either from the government with the which is the tga from bank reserves or uh they offer the rrp uh interest rate as well and what we've been seeing as the rrp has been drawing down the overall balance sheet of course has been contracting as a function of quantitive tightening uh bank reserves have been picking up the tga has been picking up over the course of the last couple of months and the rrp has come down considerably i think the fed is concerned about the fact that their overall balance sheet um will contract and that will in particular reduce the amount of bank reserves uh which is a cash asset for the banks and helps provide a liquidity buffer for the banks and so i think they're particularly concerned about seeing a circumstance where bank reserves start to fall meaningfully they'd rather have from a financial stability perspective uh the banks remain liquid and have the cash levels that they currently have and so uh in the last week they've announced they've discussed i should say not necessarily announced but discussed as well as in the fed minutes a tapering in the pace of quantitative tightening in order to ensure that the rrp doesn't go down to zero and to ensure that those bank reserves remain plentiful would that be that wouldn't necessarily be the policy i'd choose i think banks have more than enough cash and cash isn't a meaningful influence on banks financial stability or their activities uh but there's reasonable financial uh stability reasoning why you might not want to chance it uh and so this idea that the fed is going to taper the pace of quantitative tightening they might lengthen it out and kind of slow it down so it's kind of fading into the background you know is a reasonable policy choice on the margin that's supportive to asset prices as you go from a player in the market who's selling assets to selling assets at a less rapid pace um is that going to be a meaningful influence probably not and the reason why that is is the volatility of debt issuance from the treasury far outweighs uh the volatility or the influence of the of quantitative tightening and so therefore the real thing that matters is what janet yellen chooses to do in terms of the debt the debt profile of the us rather than the precise path of quantitative tightening in the us basically does the euro usd pricing make sense in the context of the relative economic conditions and i think i think it's a very good question it's one in which you know when you see in the short rate mark when you see a big divergence in macroeconomic conditions and you see which would imply different directions of monetary policy and you see a uh set of pricing in the short rate market that is consistent between those two economies uh that could easily lead to pressure on the exchange rate on a forward-looking basis with europe being considerably weaker and likely needing much easier monetary policy than the us at its core you what that speaks to is the fact that and i'll probably wrap it up here the us is outperforming the us is on a path to outperform the rest of the world over the course of at least the first half of 2024 that has important you know yet it is being priced to be weak and as that pricing comes out particularly in the bond market and the short rate market and in the exchange rate market we're likely to see significant shifts uh that occur as that market as that pricing comes out whether it's on the short end whether it's on the long end or whether it's through the dollar and so that whole complex of things um is very bearish for the dollar for bar very bearish for rates and bonds bullish for the dollar and for stocks you know you see a crosscutting set of circumstances here because the strength of the economy is likely to be even stronger than what's expected and likely to deliver you know a bit better earnings outcomes than may be implied uh from a bottoms up perspective um but that rise in rates is uh is going to be challenging in terms of valuations for stocks if we get it and so that balance the way i think about that balance is uh trade the thing that you think is going to is the best reflection of what's going on and that's stocks versus bonds which reflect what's going on with overall growth and so probably more than anything when i think about uh the equity market it's setting up for a set of conditions that are particularly bullish stocks relative to bonds over the course of the first half wrap it up there i've gone uh almost 15 minutes over uh i could talk about this stuff all day thank you so much for taking the time a few minutes out of your day uh to join us for our monthly macro webinar"
What Has to Happen for the Fed to Cut Rates?,2024-01-18 13:15:02+00:00,2,i3UEorodLOE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3UEorodLOE,i think we have five and a half cuts priced in for 2024 in total between friends here um so bob does this inflation report rhyme with the forward pricing i i think it's going to be pretty tough for the fed to swiftly shift to an easing position over the course of 24 in an environment where you know each month you're basically seeing prints between three and four% on core inflation you know annualized rates it's just it's if the economy was slowing right rapidly we were seeing growth we were seeing negative payroll prints things like that i think they'd probably be able to have the cover to swiftly ease but the combination of inflation a little too high and the overall economy growing around potential and the unemployment rate at secular lows you add that all up there's just not a not a good macroeconomic datadriven case for why the fed should be shifting towards a meaningful easing cycle certainly on par with what's priced in and i the last thing i'd emphasize is i think people who look at the scp and say well the the fed is likely to cut three times in 2024 they often forget to recognize that in that scp it also showed unemployment rising to 4.1% and that that's an important interplay because what the fed was saying there was if growth slows if the economy weak weens then inflation is low enough for us to do some maintenance cuts but if inflation doesn't weaken and and and in fact ticks up and the economy doesn't weaken in line with those expectations it's not clear the fed is going to deliver the cuts that uh that everyone is expecting and that's you know half the cuts that is priced into the market
What Do the Current Housing Dynamics Say about U.S. Inflation?,2024-01-17 13:15:02+00:00,3,7nVmEECFhKo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nVmEECFhKo,is inflation reaccelerating in the us well i think any one of these uh individual month-over-month reports you know there's just so much noise here and there about the particular data in them and i think that's one of the challenges is you can get too focused on this report versus that report as opposed to just taking a step back and saying hey look if you look at how cpi is printed over the course of the last four or five months um you know we've seen a bounce in core inflation you know we're in that sort of 3ish to three and a half range uh over the course of the last you know four or five months uh the year-over-year number as you say is is you know between three and four here and all of that is a bit too high you know it's not quite as extreme as where we were you know when we were when we were uh you know a couple years ago but we're still at a level that has got to cause some concern for the fed about swiftly shifting towards an easing cycle so bob looking at the subcomponent rent of shelter here um still printing at 0.45% month on month or so and we've been told over the past year maybe 18 months that rent of shelter will slowly but surely fade towards 2% what do you make of that very sticky slow category in the inflation index here i think a lot of folks who have argued for the the swift fall of uh shelter costs are really focused on uh posted new rents and the reality is in the us market that's just a tiny tiny portion of what's actually occurring in terms of uh whether it's direct rental costs or oar in the economy and so when you see things like the time series that around rents that um that the the various uh federal reserve agencies print and you see that continue to be above what the cpi rent report has been over the you know accumulated from 2020 that suggests that we might have the shelter cost growth continue to be elevated for an extended period of time and let's also recognize that part of what's going on with a longer lag is that house prices are reaccelerating in the united states again you know we're seeing rises between 7 and 8% uh and so while there might be a short-term supply of apartment rents that might drive down you know incremental leases the big picture story here in the us is that housing costs are going up they're not going down and that's the real concern for the fed
What's Happening In The Small Cap Market?,2024-01-16 13:15:00+00:00,4,2zQeD-eg2mw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zQeD-eg2mw,but if bond yields are going back up potentially to five and have to reset how does that won't that hit the say small caps more how are you thinking about that well i i think the the important thing is to think about the linkage here which is that the rise in bond yields um that would come would come as a function of strong growth and so that's and so on the so that is actually a good thing for unloved corners of the equity market and that rotation story and i think in general when you look at the overall equity market you know you've got that handful of you know that small handful of stocks that drove a fair amount of the rally in uh in 23 you know those are priced to perfection um in in the sense of the they certainly could continue their their strength but there's a very high expectations going on if you start to talk about you know small cap value you know it's priced for misery um and so you know getting something moderately better than misery is uh you know is is could easily be a surprise to the upside for a lot of that a lot of those um a lot of those markets and so that's really where i think the the opportunity here is not necessarily to go with the trend of the previously hot performers but it's to look in those areas that have been unloved who are likely most likely to benefit uh from the continued strength and economic conditions and and frankly some of the healing some of the improvements in their balance sheet and their and their overall um circumstances that they've taken while times have been a little tight here the last couple years and so i think that there's been some perception that small small caps smaller companies you know smaller to mediumsized companies um are are just destroyed in a higher interest rate environment it depends on how high the rates are and what the what the underlying economy is it sounds like you're saying there is a situation where a strong economy with elevated interest rates is something that they can live with if they're doing well enough it's not that higher rates are always going to wipe out or make the cost of borrowing so punitive that they can't that they can't thrive that that's right and and actually a lot of those um a lot of the tension that we've seen over the last two years has challenged some of the crappiest ones of those the ones needing uh needing capital on an ongoing basis uh and so and and washed a fair amount of companies out great point and so what we're left with as an example if you look at russell 2k uh its average weighted average borrowing cost is 4.2% you know if nominal gdp is growing at five or six uh you know a 4.2% bment cost is totally manageable for those companies right and a lot of them had found ways to term out the debt that they have you know the companies that are still in those sectors are are are um have found ways to turn out the debt and so that there you know they're they're actually benefiting uh not nearly as much as sort of the biggest companies from this environment but they're not nearly in as nearly a bad a shape as uh as as you might think and and and this chart shows um back to through 23 but if you were to draw it even further back of course these companies uh you know took some real pain over the course of the last two years and so i think there's there's even more catchup that can be done uh on a on a longer term basis from these companies that you know really up until just a couple of months ago had been treading water for a very long time down for a while
Determining the Impact of Fiscal Policy,2024-01-15 13:15:00+00:00,3,HNWINE52HpI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWINE52HpI,how are you thinking about this impact from fiscal you know are people figuring out how to track it it seems like the lag from that getting into the real economy is really tricky yeah i i think uh you know fiscal policy has uh is always a bit of a challenge because you have to track how all the money flows and and important to recognize the delays that exist in fiscal policy i always like like to talk about um after the the financial crisis there was a you know a reinvestment act and they kept working on a road by my house for 10 years 10 years after you don't live in boston it wasn't the big dig was it right the big dig went on for 15 years 20 years but um but you know that gives you a sense of these things is is that the timing matters and so as an example you know there was with the with the infrastructure act uh you know the money was allocated the bonds were borrowed right the the bonds were issued to finance that but it's going to take a while for that to actually flow through the real economy and so that elevated economic activity associated with a number of those programs is actually like to likely to peak here in 24 it picked up a lot somewhat in 22 a lot in 23 but is actually going to go even further here in 24 so from a growth perspective there's a lot of that um a lot of that stimulus that's coming from those sort of structural fiscal story are that it's still in the pipeline which is very interesting because essentially what we've done is we've engaged in a big fiscal stimulation at a time when the unemployment rates at secular lows and part of the story of why it's taking so long is that a lot of state and local governments who are actually implementing the the infrastructure they're the ones who build the roads the federal government doesn't mostly build the roads the state and local governments do they actually like are struggling to find the people to hire them to build the roads because the the employment situation's so tight which may not be the worst thing in the world if this thing is stretched out appropriately plus you know if you take it you can you give it you can take it away too we can't we can't forget that so but so it's tricky it's tricky to figure out how all of that drifts down and you know for those of you sitting outside the us this is a this is as bob pointed out from federal to state to local to municipal getting it out there i mean it's a long process you the government doesn't move quickly so in in a good scenario bob it kind of lays support under economy in a bad in a bad situation it's like gasoline on something that's too hot already right and and you've got to try to figure that out and nobody seems to really know the answer to that including the fed which is why these projections like everybody's kind of doing it on the back of the envelope
Is There Stress in The Bank Sector?,2024-01-14 13:15:04+00:00,3,ow7sLGVhOgg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow7sLGVhOgg,we've got the gist of it why is the pickup in the btfp the facility they created not a sign of stress in the banking sector no no sign of stress in the banking sector related to btfp and i think uh very important i actually i i put out a a tweet about a few hours ago highlighting you can see um the btfp is structured in a way where you pay the one-year interest rate and because there are cuts priced in um the one-year interest rate is lower than the deposit rate that you get at the fed and just as that arbitrage started to open uh you saw a pickup in borrowing it's not it's also not a big pickup in borrowing the overall btfp is less than 1% of aggregate deposits in the banking system so first of all we're not talk btfp is like a rounding error uh in the scheme of the overall you know economy it's like talking about grand rapids to have a conversation about the us economy uh is like what we love you grand rapids if you're listening grand rapids no hate i i come from michigan so whenever i need sort of a generic small town that you know no one you must be you must be very happy after the uh ion blue through and through my my uh my parents retired went to university of michigan and retired there so uh they are uh very excited um it's about time hopefully it doesn't take you know 26 years uh for the next one but uh talk about where harbaugh's going after this but we don't have time for that let's say focus on the market this is not sports talk radio even we could we could definitely spend a lot of time talking about it but um but you know i think i i the btfp is just is it's not that big a deal it mattered in a moment right there was a question of whether there was matter a lot moment because it ring fence the crisis of confidence that was unfolding exactly and whether it was going to metastasize and what the government said is we're not going to let this metastasize and if anything the the promise for it to not metastasize matters a lot more more than the particular money in the btfp and then there's this goofy thing more recently about the about the arbitrage thing so and plus they said that they're going to roll the loans that are in it on the date that it closes and so there's some urgency if you want to take advantage of it to sort of move some technical technical stuff going a bunch of technical stuff the thing to look at is the weekly bank deposit numbers uh you can get those the h8 report comes out 4:15 every friday and what you see in the in the bank deposit numbers is deposits after the svb thing have flattened out and they've actually improved in the last couple weeks which is an indication that the issue is not a bank issue deposits are up not down over the last couple weeks reflecting the fact that banks are doing pretty well
Bond Easing Expectations vs Reality?,2024-01-13 13:15:00+00:00,4,9Vgev1JyFks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vgev1JyFks,that the bar market is just way ahead of itself in terms of what's going to happen from an easing perspective mark is asking if there's little or no easing where are the danger areas on a sector or asset basis well i think we just discussed the fact that bonds look ver look look like they'll need to repic would you expect and it sounds like you're saying you expect more of that on the short end i mean where where would you be most concerned about bonds yeah i mean i think that the the short end pricing is the most extreme uh in terms of the the mispricing and we've seen a few cycles of this like year killed everyone how i mean how many narratives did we have last year we went from you know recession now to start the year higher for longer to credit crisis to higher for longer to you know fed cutting you know cutting 160 basis points you know we we go up and down and i think this is kind of this is kind of the complexion of the market um you know if you you if you look back over the last 15 years people have sort of learned to follow the trend and so you wanted to catch the twists in the trend because the trends extended for a long time but what we what we've had really over the last 18 months is we've had the macroeconomy sort of the aggregate trend of the economy sort of meandering not really moving very much um and you've had expectations whip around up and down and up and down and you've actually been a better position to fade extreme pricing than you have been to try and call the the trend shift and i think we're in another one of those circumstances where the pricing got a little overextended particularly at the end of the year and we're now sort of fading back to a more reasonable uh pricing dynamic i think what you i just want to i just want to underscore that because i think that this is a really really important point because this is kind of a strategy right and i think you're really giving voice to the fact that everybody has recency bias and what what served you well is catching in the turn right getting ahead of what everybody else was a beat later on seeing and that was a turn in a cycle but you're saying now or the turn in prices that identified a change in conditions right what you're saying now is really it's hard to tell what's going to happen so be on the lookout for an overextension and sort of fade what looks like an extreme move because we've seen does that does that mean there's more volatil volatility does that suggest that we're just in a more volatile period and you're going to want to look out for those overextensions yeah i i think we've seen a lot of of overextensions part of that i think is the uncertainty a lot of uncertainty in the market about how it will respond how the economy will respond to the monetary policy that we're seeing and so um in in in some way and and circumstances that people haven't really seen in their careers so like you know i think a lot of people as an example with the svb circumstance didn't really have the benchmarks and the depth of understanding to recognize was this a was this like a 2008 crisis or was this you know not that big a deal um and so you know they went right to crisis because that was a bit of a a framework that they had or an easy way to move into the market and then backed off of that as they realized it's not that big a deal all things considered and plus the government responded to it yeah well that's the other that's what makes it confusing right
2008 and 2020 Were Not Macro Cycles,2024-01-12 13:15:00+00:00,2,7Y68T1gie9c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y68T1gie9c,you know a lot a lot of us have lived through only two uh or and a lot of us are our most recent memories are two very acute cycles which is 20 and 2008 both of which were highly uh you know highly v-shaped in terms of their dynamics where um where there was an acute crisis point market sold off uh as a response to that acute crisis and then easing occurred and marcus rebound and i think in a lot of ways that got folks to thinking that first crisis happens you often hear people say first something breaks and then uh the economy and markets respond but that's not normally how macroeconomic cycles work most macroeconomic cycles are self-reinforcing which is that the tightening of monetary policy leads to a weakening of asset prices the weakening of asset prices leads to a slowing of demand that's slowing of demand leads to weakening asset prices right it's a reinforcing dynamic and so what i'd expect to see through this cycle is that we're probably going to have to see some meaningful equity weakness before we start to get enough growth slowing to then start to create the recessionary dynamics to then start to create the downturn but that is going to be a reinforcing process and it will continue until the point in which there's a sufficiently large easing which can help reverse the economy and we're not going to get to that but my guess is that that's going to be tougher than most people expect and so thinking about where how will the markets play out that timing dynamic the timing dynamic will be bond yields or bonds underperform stocks outperform then stocks underperform and bonds outperform and that stuck under performance is self-reinforcing
Insight into Oil Market,2024-01-11 13:15:04+00:00,4,hhMT-qXbmTU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhMT-qXbmTU,oil there's a there are a lot of traders that speculate on oil um lots of events took place this year that could impact oil uh that that caused it to run up into the 90s just a couple weeks ago uh it was down at 68 um it's been floating between 70 and 75 right now you know we've had ukraine this middle east conflict that started in october we've had opec plus kind of battling with each other with cuts and and so on how do you see the action in oil in in the first half of 2024 i mean they've done everything they can to bring it back to $80 and hasn't worked so well yeah what's your view there i don't know if it's something you analyze much but i'd like to hear your opinion on it yeah i i i think is an interesting market um uh in in many ways just you want to think about it sort of it's almost two different markets that intersect with each other which is it's a paper market in terms of you know money fast money speculators and then it's a real market in terms of there are people you know who consume oil and produce oil and things like that uh in the market and so and you sort of have to you have to balance both of those things at any point in time and the ideal moments are those two pressures are sort of moving in the same direction uh against you know a valuation that's in the opposite one um so when i think about that context on the in the real demand in the real market you know the oil situation has been one that has been um you know there's a lot of supply like us supply in particular is just you know the us just keeps hitting new highs in terms of supply and most of what can be done is o opec and particularly saudi arabia are just trying to take barrels off the market so we don't get a big price decline and they've done a pretty good job of that and they have a lot of flexibility and i think that you know that kind of makes sort of let's call it the natural position in oil like in the 80ish range right which would keep you know which would keep up with the demand dynamics which are going to be decent with you know the supply that's happening a little bit of saudi arabia coming off the market i think the real interesting thing is is what's going on in the paper market where we actually see hedge funds in particular uh and fast money really selling oil aggressively i think it's one of those things where the in market action is driving things that are nonsensical because what is happening for many of these funds is that they're seeing bond yields collapse and what would you know if you go back to the financial crisis you know you know some people might not remember like oil pressed well into the s right yeah and well above $100 to barrel and the financial crisis hit and oil fell to you know you know fell like 75% in the course of weeks and so a lot of people equate the bond yield move with oil there's an intermarket action dynamic that are trading those things off and so i think what we're seeing is that that's causing uh a big paper short to to emerge in the market which is not really consistent with the underlying fundamentals and so if we were to get pressure off the bond yield i think we're probably going to get upward pressure on the oil market in the context of you know a balanced market that is you know i guess we're like a little bit below what the right pr you know we're still a little bit below what the right price is on a balanced market
"Who Loses If the Fed Stays ""Higher for Longer""",2024-01-10 13:15:03+00:00,3,yLxuGhIS1bc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLxuGhIS1bc,who stands to lose and pay the price for this for the fact that the fed or for your idea that the fed has no catalyst to cut rates and that they'll be higher for longer who who in your opinion is positioned to lose the most here i think it's it's got to be focus on uh the bond holders you know people who are buying bonds today and i thought today was actually a really interesting example because you saw you saw saw this intermarket action dynamic that was happening which is that stocks started to fall and the bond and bonds were bid hard in response to stocks falling without much recognition without an acknowledgement that like bonds are already bond have already fallen a ton right it's it's you know a 1% or one and a half percent move in stocks just off of all-time highs right in a total return basis is creating a huge bid on bonds that set of linkages doesn't add up i mean it adds up directionally like in general when asset prices when stocks go down bonds often go up but what it does what doesn't make sense is is the magnitudes and the or the order of magnitudes between things and so basically we've got a situation prices in the bond market where huge cuts are expected no inflation uh you know and recession that's priced in and just you know it feels a lot like conversations i was having you know a year ago when i was like look the economy i think is going to be a little more resilient than people expect and people are like you're an idiot buy bonds 35 they're going to three they're going to two you know people were hollering about how bonds were the best buy in the world a year ago and they were dead wrong by a lot and and only i mean really bailed out here in the last minute by the fed and treasury easing and so i think we're we're like getting back to that same situation and that's why i go back to that headline story which is the macroeconomy itself is not moving it is boring it is meandering very very slowly moderating a little bit and our expectations are going like this and the expectations today in the bond market are for no inflation fast interest rate cuts and a terrible growth outcome in 2024 and it just doesn't make sense
"""Real Rates"" vs Interest Rates",2024-01-09 13:15:00+00:00,3,-j0e_X_Esyg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j0e_X_Esyg,explain to me like i'm five this thing where they say the the fed is going to grow more and more concerned about real rates versus yields i think is what can you explain what that is what is the concern there that the fed may have to act more swiftly well um i i'll i'll uh explain it like like your five i mean here's here's the basic idea which is um in general you want to think about real rates uh to think about whether interest rates are high or low in an economy at the extreme it makes a lot of sense that you do this for instance if interest rates were 10% and inflation was zero and your wage growth was zero that would be a very high interest rate relative to the income you could possibly earn but if interest rates are 10 % and your wages are growing at 10% a year well that's a very different story right because your your wages your income is growing about as fast as your financing costs that's at the extreme it makes a lot of sense to think about that i think one of the challenges here is that a very academic fed is thinking about this on the margin so they're looking at something and they're saying well the current interest rate is you know five and a half and inflation was five and then it's going to become you know three and therefore the real interest rate has risen and that in an academic sense means a tightening in the way that i just described before in the illustrative example but but like to who like in what way does that actually create the tightening like i think this is a real this is a place where the fed is is like the academics are running a muck rather than people who like actually live and breathe in the real world like what happens let's say you know wages don't move that fast so wage growth is about 5% in the economy give or take right if inflation goes from five to two or five to three you actually feel better not worse right your real spending power increases and so in a very short term time frame or over a time frame that the fed really cares about like falling inflation and stable income is actually stimulative not tight yeah right because people will feel like they have more spending power but yet the academics running around saying well i've got this paper and this model and these frankly like pretty bad pretty pretty bad disconnected thoughts are sitting there saying well it should lead to an easing and so i think that's that's the tension point is that they think it's a tightening at a time when it actually the exact opposite is true given the fact that wage growth is not likely to change very fast in response to falling inflation
Monetary Policy's Influence on Bonds and Stocks,2024-01-08 13:15:09+00:00,3,wYQbK1I7h1E,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYQbK1I7h1E,say there's two things one there's been a change in policy stance that's all there is to it you have to you know either accept it or get out of the way and so you know i i have there's no i'm not i've never been a bear or a bull right it's it's you know it's depending on the circumstances and dependent upon the market pricing and so this is a good example of that where people who got entrenched in one view or another you know have not i mean really the realities haven't done well over the cl course of the last two years neither bulls nor bears have done well over the last two years the people who have done well have been flexible and responsive to the dynamics at play now the thing i would say in terms of being a bear you can make me the biggest bear on bonds and on short rates now that's a different conversation but stocks you know the us economy is doing pretty well and if anything we just got a big easing cycle you know a big easing injection uh over the course of the last couple you know the last two months and uh for all the recession doomers out there like a strong economy getting 100 basis points of yield easing and stocks up you know 10 or 15% like that that's not like the fast path to recession that's not how it works yeah that's fair i you know i was looking back and you were also sort of adamant about that the market was pricing in 25% earnings growth in 2024 and 2025 and that was sort of your reason to be cautious if you will um but i but monetary trump's eps is that the message that's for sure i mean monetary conditions trump trump eps uh absolutely and i think there's also interestingly right now a flows dynamic which is particularly advantageous on a forward-looking basis for stocks relative to bonds because stocks uh have been depressed haven't actually been as responsive to this easing as you'd normally expect because there's been a big rebalancing dynamic in the market if you look back through the course of this year obviously long bonds are down a lot relative to stocks what happens if you're a big institutional investor you have asset allocation targets is you have to sell your stocks and buy your bonds in order to bring your bond allocation up by the end of the year that is a big negative pressure on stocks relative to bonds that it's flowing through right now but there will be a point looks like it might even start kind of this weekish where that pressure is going to start to fade right which is going to lead to more buoyancy in stocks relative to bonds
Actively Managed ETFs Popularity in Post-Pandemic Period,2024-01-07 13:15:01+00:00,2,D7lDdfoBRVI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7lDdfoBRVI,and like investors advisors everybody is interested in actively managed etfs it took 25 years yeah right for like honestly i think c i mean say what you want kathy would kick the door down you might not like her investing strategy you might not love her marketing but she is the reason that active etfs have exploded in popularity in the post pandemic period and it's staying that way she's been a absolutely a torch bearer for the active etf community i also think from a a product creator standpoint the regulatory changes created a lot more flexibility to do a lot more interesting stuff right without having to get approval from the sec and stuff like that and you know you basically brought down you know i talked to people who started you know startup etf businesses 10 years ago and it was you know millions of dollars to start right and get the exemption and the legal papers and setting up the trusts and all that that stuff and now today if you have an idea i mean you could literally in like you know 75 days i think what's new is get done for a few hundred thousand bucks i was going to say there are platform providers who have figured out it's a pretty good business to help somebody that has a great idea get their product trading like uh al architect alpha architect west gray like those guys helped a few friends of ours and they realized hey this is act we have a lot of knowhow here we can help these people that have great ideas it's actually a good business so that's that's what's new those guys are are i mean they're they're great businesses and they're helping a lot of a lot of folks
Active Managed ETFS: (A New Breed),2024-01-06 13:15:02+00:00,6,GdXZchdNSmo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdXZchdNSmo,b chunis tweeted the percentage of new etf launches that are actively managed has reached a record 80% which is wild 80% of the launches of etfs were active etfs he said and he also said active i'm not surprised by that no active etfs are also taking a court of the flows i guess are are factors considered active i guess probably for this for this probably yeah they are there are but fine but my point is it's not we we don't need any more index funds we have a million we got all the pieces that's the beautiful thing right the pieces are now free uh i wouldn't want to be the guy who's creating a business around selling the pieces right because because it's a terrible business that's literally that's a business that's going to fall to zero essentially right your ip is worth nothing it's just whose index you can license and what's the lowest amount and even these factors right these factors are basically free at this point or so close to free yes um that it's not worth it and so the question is i i i think a lot of active managers are looking at the etf rapper and they're saying you know with the the the regulatory changes in 2021 giving a lot more flexibility to be able to run long short etc it's actually a pretty good rapper to run a product yeah they're getting they're getting uh uh permission to not reveal their holdings right away they're getting like they're getting like a lot of reasons to if not build a new one at least replicate an existing fund in in this rapper that's and that and that directionally probably continues i think so and and i mean the thing that that often probably doesn't get talked about is operationally with all these white label providers it's actually operationally pretty efficient to run an etf so whereas you know if you go to a big lp fund like 50 70% of the people are like people who are not doing nothing related to running the money yeah right so you could have you could have a you know you could be paying 100 basis points of your fund structure for people who are back office in operations you launch an etf use one of these white label platforms you can do that for 15 basis points so this is the so the last bastion of the mutual fund is retirement and they just haven't perfected fractional etf purchasing in 401ks and getting everyone in that ecosystem comfortable with the mechanics of that 100% it's going to happen i can't believe it's taken this long when that does happen and a very mainstream 401k provider just says okay this is now part of the mainstream platform etf 401k is how we're doing it going forward that's going to be a domino's falling moment i think i think it's going to be tough for a lot of those uh those businesses that running the 401ks because they're charging yeah they're charging a lot of money for a lot of that nobody needs them to do anymore that's well that's what's held it up there's that's what's entrenching that's what's entrenching the mutual fund structure i was looking at targeta funds and and if you take vanguard out the aum weighted target day fund cost is like 40 basis points 50 basis way too high yeah in this in this day and age way too high that's that i mean way too high that's just theft yeah right for a product that is it's it's an index product yeah and essentially the robos are unbundled versions of a life cycle fund right that's exactly right you're putting in the date that you expect to retire and they're saying here's the they giving you the etf components of what those life cycle funds are buying so i think i i there was a s about mutual fund outflow from a morning st report recently i think it was 64 straight months or something so it's melting ice cube if that ever happens it will be a flame a torch to the ice cube yeah we just don't know when if if it's gonna i think it's a i think it's a when i don't think it's an if you got a lot a lot of entrenched interests i mean you think like take it from the you know the the david in the etf the active 40ac product world like the goliaths are out there they're big and they're angry right about this and they are they will do whatever it takes well one thing is though that they are increasingly willing now to dip uh to dip a toe in both and like we saw dimensional was one of the last holdouts to do etfs now it's their hottest business they're going to keep going so at a certain point there won't be any incumbents left who haven't embraced this for at least their top managers so like like every mutual fund company has its quote unquote flagship right or it's like best managers at some point the manager is going to say to them dude i'm crushing it why am i why am why am i in outflow why am i in redemption like give me a better structure all i want to do is manage money i don't want to watch money leave like they're gonna have to it just it takes so long like a lot of other things yeah it takes so long but i mean it is true that what what what huge market size is this 10 trillion in actively managed mutual funds right right and in actively managed etfs it's like 500 billion and you know and that includes stuff that i would say is index adjacent
The Fed is Unlikely to Ease Anymore (Anytime Soon),2024-01-05 13:15:03+00:00,3,eia5U2RTUbk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eia5U2RTUbk,i believe you hold the outlook that in this environment it's likely to be high for longer is that correct what yeah i think i mean i i think an environ like i i think going and thinking about the fed's policy and asking yourself like why ease like like like genuinely like why should the fed meaningfully ease monetary policy i could understand if growth was weak right then it would make a lot of sense to ease or not tighten as much like back when we had the svv situation it made sense that they were a bit more cautious as we were sort of sorting out is that going to be a big deal or a small deal ended up being not that big a deal but it made sense for them to be cautious but like where is the thing that causes the fed to be hesitant uh with the current monetary policy like as far as i can tell there no right and so that's the basic question when you when you think about like central bank's behavior is tilted towards uh towards stasis right they sit they wait they want to see more evidence come in right part of i mean what what have we learned over the course of the last two years is that the fed's you know three years the fed's always behind right because they're sitting there just they want to be real sure that something's going to happen and i think that's reflective of the fact that their natural position is to do nothing and so now the question is what causes them to move quickly central banks move quickly when growth conditions are are rapidly deteriorating they're actually quite good at that when when growth conditions are bad they move right particularly to the downside but like moderation and inflation to a level that's slightly above their target is that the reason why they're gonna cut interest rates at you know 160 basis points like it it it genuinely it does but when growth is okay when growth is okay so what are they gonna do like why why would they ease interest rates aggressively other than they just wanted to like juice asset markets all get out which is basically what they've done you know even by the sheer hint that they might ease a little bit
Yellen's Shift from Bonds to Bills,2024-01-04 13:15:00+00:00,3,6nqb2EGPuiE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nqb2EGPuiE,i think the first the first easing uh was by secretary janet yellen at the treasury and basically we we all know that there's a big fiscal deficit uh and the question is how do you finance that fiscal deficit for all sorts of for a number of different reasons related to the debt ceiling she was able to finance it using selling short duration securities uh and then and drawing on the essentially the treasury's bank account at the fed right she refilled that bank account selling only short duration securities and in the summer indicated that she would start selling more long duration securities but then walked that back on november 1 and that's essentially if you just think about whether you call it easing or not the long end interest rate market is just a market and it's buyers and sellers and the treasury is the big seller and if the treasury one day everyone expects to issue a bunch of more bonds and the next day they they say that they're not going to issue you know they're not going to pick up their bond issuance that's a big change in the future expectations and that's a big part it's about half of what we saw in terms of that bond rally uh that that started this this cycle that really started on november 1 well yeah you make a a great point but it's a point that i don't think many people have actually got their heads around um was was that the the minute they were supposed to announce that they were going to be selling a whole bunch of 20 year and 30-year bonds all of a sudden she go no not gonna do no i mean huge shift to bills a huge shift to bills and this is the pro like sh in an interview you know typically the the bond mix this is not this is a matter for like the technocratic treasury nerds right they're like carefully like with their sharp pencils figuring out exactly what the normal ratios are and what janny yell didn't was said screw that we don't we don't care what's going on with what the technocrats say i'm just not issuing the bonds and what she made in that choice she made a policy decision about something that had previously been a technocratic decision and that's a big deal because it means because she sits in a policy because she sits in a political role not a independent role and she's now pursuing a set of policies that have meaningful influence on the macroecon economic dynamic
Treasury and Fed 'Easing Einvironment',2024-01-03 13:15:06+00:00,3,rRkG6ZOgKu8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRkG6ZOgKu8,and in particular starting with the qra announcement on november 1st it became very clear that janet yellen was going to back off the market based tightening and the long end tightening and then that was reinforced by uh by how jerome powell is positioned it back in november 1st and then again uh at the meeting uh uh last week and so you put that together and it's like look the overall picture is one is a stance of easing now is easing when we had an inflationary spike and unemployment's at secular lows and stocks are making new highs is easing really the appropriate thing to do i i saw recently that you know we had in the last eight weeks the biggest easings since either the bottom in 2009 or the bottom in 2020 but heck like you got to go with what's going on and and they've decided to ease and and the markets are going to respond in that you know well when you say easing though you're speaking on of two different types of easing there's the fed and the fact that instead of actually selling uh bonds they stopped selling bonds and then there's pal and his pivot which is now like the anopia thing the piv the pal pivot was powerful um and and combined it it it basically it forced equities to go up in value since there was no you know the wind was at their sals not at their head is that basically what you're saying yeah i mean if anything i think uh equity investors will quickly forget or not notice the fact that long end bonds bonds at the same volatility of stocks are up more since november 1st than stocks are so with that highlights this is not a story of it's actually not repricing stronger growth expectations in the economy which is interesting and i think creates actually a forward-looking opportunity what's been priced in is a big easing that's been reflected in the yield market and that's flowing through almost directly into equities now i think that's setting us up for an interesting opportunity in particular in the first quarter because what that means is we've had a big easing stocks have actually trailed high volatility or long duration bonds my guess is we'll see a flip of that because a big easing is the sort of thing that's good for stocks but particularly bad for bonds
2024 Market Expectations for the Short Rate,2024-01-02 13:15:03+00:00,3,nZXSnKt8XGs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZXSnKt8XGs,what do you what's your perspective going into 2024 well i think the main the main thing when i look across the markets is that um in terms of the uh current pricing you always when you're trading macro markets you got to start with the current pricing because that's what you're trading that's what you're buying is a path of future expectations in the markets and let's start very straightforwardly with the short rate market which is now pricing in just looking at a quote right now basically 160 basis points easing between 160 170 base points depending on how you look at it um that would be a very substantial easing uh that would have to come uh in order just to meet market expectations now to be long short rates long two-year bonds you basically have to expect something even more even greater cuts than that and really when you look at the the overall sort of distribution of those expectations uh there's a greater than 30% expectation of that interest rate short rates will be below 3% by the end of next year now that's a pretty remarkable thought process because what that implies is basically a crash landing in the economy that's meaningfully influencing people's expectations of future monetary policy and that's coming in a time when um everything frankly from a macro perspective is pointing in the opposite direction right stocks are making new highs we've had a 100 basis point plus move down in bond yields uh and even more in mortgage rates uh the economy you know is growing at potential or better based upon the data that existed before we got this big market-based easing and uh unemployment is at secular lows you put that all together typically that would not align with an immediate crash in the economy the way the short rate market is priced and so i think that's probably the biggest tension point is we're probably going to see a pretty good economy coming in to uh you know the first six months let's say of the of the year there's no reason to believe that we're not going to have a decent economic set of conditions and that's going to cause i think a lot of of conflict with the massive cuts being priced into the short rate market which should put pressure on bonds in particular relative to stocks and on short rates uh to go higher in the new year
A Quick Summary of 2023 Markets and Economy,2024-01-01 05:00:02+00:00,3,42gtFFFm4F8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42gtFFFm4F8,can you summarize some the key milestones that you have come across for this year what goes into your diary for 2023 well i i i think uh if we just start where we were at the beginning of the year which was basically everyone was all in on recession now uh and we get to the end of the year and the unemployment rate is at sec still at secular lows and growth is still well above potential and stocks are making new highs uh and bond y have risen and so just taking a step back like what you what you the basic dynamic that we're seeing right now is a very slow moving slowing of the macroeconomy and that's actually pretty normal like usually uh macro cycles take a long time to play out and this one is no different if anything it's a little slower because it's a little less sensitive to the tightening cycle that's occurred given the terming out of debt and things like that when you know um when rates were very very low and liquidity was plentiful so we basically have this very glacial move in the macroeconomy and if we look back through the course of the year what we've seen is extremely volatile expectations right so we went coming into the year expectations of a recession now that didn't translate we went to higher for longer then we had svb and it came down then we had you know an ai productivity boom and and higher for longer again then we had a shift back as you know people were concerned that there would be you know too much tightening in the market plus the f in the treasury eased and then we get to today where basically the expectation is well in some ways it's a bit odd it's it's it's pricing in the perfect soft landing with huge interest rate cuts over the course of 24 uh but at the same time stocks making new highs right so basically the market's saying we're going to have 160 170 basis points of cuts and stocks keep pushing higher and that's kind of the per it's it's the softest you know 100% perfection of the softest of the soft landings that could ever occur is priced into markets right now
Economic Expectations for 2024?,2023-12-23 13:15:01+00:00,4,SKEJPMv9ppQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKEJPMv9ppQ,uh often the question is basically on the ordering why does stock why do stock declines need to happen why not just look past the recession that will come and just be long equities today and the reason why that is is because um is because you have to have equity weakness in order to have and when i say equity weakness i mean company weakness both through equity prices but also through falling earning in order to get the recession to occur and the reason why that is is because only when you have falling equity prices does demand slow and only when you have falling earnings do labor markets weaken and i think you could see that very directly smaller uh share of the economy but you could see that very directly which is when did the tech layoff start the tech layoff started when we saw tech stocks fall in 2022 substantially the stocks fell right the the response was to that to the the stocks fell the earnings fell and the response to that was to increase their layoffs now of course that was a only one small sector of the economy it only represented 2.7 million people in terms of employment it wasn't that big a deal on the macro level but i think what it highlights is the ordering which is you don't get the sort of of labor market deterioration until you get the point where stocks and earnings fall and so just think about that dynamic when you're thinking about um when you're thinking think about that case study when you're thinking about how this is likely to play out at the broader macroeconomic level we've got there's a lot of work to do if we just take a step back on the overall economy we're still uh running a secularly tight labor market nominal growth remains elevated relative to what's appropriate for the fed's mandate and despite the fact that and on the margin we have experienced a meaningful easing over the course of the last uh four or five or six weeks all that aligns with a stronger economy not a weaker economy and all that is inconsistent with the significant amount of interest rate cuts that are being priced in to the short rate and the long end of the market uh the bond market and so when we uh when we look out to what 2024 will probably look like my guess is is we're going to see a real disappointment when it comes to meeting those incredibly high expectations for cuts more than anything else that's probably going to be the theme in the same way for bond holders we had a the biggest theme in 2023 was the cuts that were expected particularly after svb didn't come to fruition at all
What's Behind Bond Market Rally in Late 2023?,2023-12-22 13:15:01+00:00,4,NLmIw4UN4Ws,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLmIw4UN4Ws,a lot of folks uh along the way are pointing to uh the bond market rally and saying hey i actually think you know bonds must know something and if there's one thing we've learned uh over the course of the last couple of years is that the bond market may not be the smart money i mean how many times have we gone through this process where a massive amount of cuts get priced into the market remember the short rate market priced in for cuts in in uh in march of 2023 the bond market and the short rate market priced in four cuts in 2023 where are our four cuts right totally uh to expectations that were totally inconsistent with how the economy played out because the economy was much more resilient uh than that folks expected similarly we're we're basically seeing a repeat of that pattern which is a whole lot of cuts are being expected and then in many cases what folks are doing is they're looking at the bond market and they're saying look bonds are rallying hard they must be telling us something about what's going on but i think what we're seeing today in many ways is a repeat and a more extreme repeat of what we saw in late 2022 that set our set ourselves up for a pretty big bond sell off in the beginning of the year and what that is is we've had a big underperformance of long-term bonds relative to stocks over the course of the year long-term bonds uh through thanksgiving were down about 25% relative to stocks what that mechanically does is for big institutional investors that have targets for stocks and bonds allocation they must rebalance back into the underperforming asset and they typically do that somewhat sometimes at quarter end but almost always are doing that right there before the end of the year but in that thanksgiving period through the end of the year and increasingly what we're seeing is that um is that fast money hedge funds are recognizing that this is a typical dynamic and are in some ways front running the actual flows and so what you saw in 2022 in late 2022 with that red line which is thanksgiving uh noted is after a period of some underperformance of bonds relative to stocks you saw a pretty good bid for bonds for for a few weeks through december 17th and then what happened was the fast money sold it to the actual rebalancing and bonds came back down i think we're probably seeing a similar dynamic where but only at a larger scale where the significant amount of underperformance of bonds is creating that short-term rebalancing which is putting pressure on bonds and obfuscating uh the positive growth dynamics the positive liquidity dynamics that have come from this easing and showing up as a bond rally now that can persist for so long but my guess is we're going to start to see the pressures ease off of the bond market um and equities will outperform bonds as that rebalancing pressure starts to fade
What's Driving Structural Inflation?,2023-12-21 13:15:00+00:00,3,3ZJNG9lPzZQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZJNG9lPzZQ,"what if we we find ourselves in an environment in 2024 where the economy starts to overheat where the s&p is up 20% home prices are up another 10% and they have to say holy we got to we got a tighten again is that possible that we see that we see those conditions ease too quickly the thing that's actually interesting is if you look at the market pricing on the short rate market you're actually seeing you you're seeing a lot of people piling into expectations of them easing but what you're seeing is actually uh the probability of of hikes next year starting to rise in that short rate market and so people are start you know i think a lot of folks the the smart money is looking at the set of conditions and saying the odds that there's a hike next year are not zero they're getting higher because of the way that they're behaving bob everyone everyone uh was like very good about pointing out the lag effect of hikes and why aren't we seeing it show up and why aren't why aren't spreads blowing out and why isn't this and why isn't that why wouldn't it work in the same way so the so the fed now indicating that its next move is an easing michael's point like what if the stock market runs up blah blah blah shouldn't there be lag effects to cuts we have no like we have no evidence that the stock market running up will bring back about inflation we have the opposite experience if you if you think about uh 2012 2013 stocks were ripping higher like 50 and 60% rally uh and we didn't get any inflation yeah because remember that that was the jobless recovery right it was the asset man's recovery the asset owners recovery right but it was the jobless recovery but we have we have the opposite right now we have a a unemployment to 3.7% yeah right we're adding you know essentially we're i me the reason why point is the stock market wouldn't be the thing that causes it it's the employ the employment market and the and absolutely which is that the nominal income nominal income today like income growth for for high spending cohorts like under $150,000 is growing between five and six% a year that's up 2 to 3% relative to where we were in 2019 so just think about that like that's the structural gap in the economy"
Powell's Commentary as Inflation Fight Continues,2023-12-20 13:15:03+00:00,4,fvnpeWhxD0k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvnpeWhxD0k,the show but my next guest says that 2024 will be an important test for the fed's credibility given their policy indications versus market pricing i'm going to bring an unlimited ceo and cio bob elliott all right bob so first how surprised were you at at jp's confidence that he was exuding i mean obviously the market's like it but a lot of people were caught flat footed well i think mission accomplished uh and all the connotation that comes with it was a bit of a extreme positioning by the fed in this particular move in the couple of speeches beforehand and i think they're recognizing that maybe that was going a bit too far as they came out over the course of the last couple days day after day trying to walk that back and say hey look we still have quite a ways to go in terms of really beating in is it possible pal went off script dur during the q&a thing got caught up in a moment so so to speak i mean listen it's a pretty you he's in the spotlight i know he's got his his folder i didn't see him i didn't see him refer to the folder as often as before maybe just started feeling himself a little bit yeah well i think i think they want uh they they've been criticized so much over the last two years and with good reason right and so they're they're looking for any light that they can get remember a year ago when it looked like inflation was moderating a bit pal walked in at the end of january early february cheering that it was done and last year inflation was not done right so uh i think they need to be a you know likely a little more cautious than what they portrayed and i think they're seeing that as they convey with all the speakers then of course there was that period where the market was ignoring everything he said then he went to and hole started really that pain speech right to kind of drive home the fact hey we want to be able to jaw bone markets up and down and i'm wondering if they're losing that you you make some interesting points with this new fed dot plot about the fed being at ease i guess waiting longer now to hit that 2% target well i think one of the key things about the dot plot that's interesting is not their predictive capacity because the fed can't predict we've seen that over the last few years right is thinking about what their reaction function is and i think the thing that's so interesting is that they're saying inflation will be above 2% for the next couple of years before they bring it down and so they're comfortable with elevated inflation now think about that if inflation doesn't get to 2% till 2025 or 26 that's 5 years over target and all of america's paying for that right so what happened then the higher for you know higher for longer now there's three cuts next year a lot of people a lot of very smart people a lot of people who are in charge of managing money took the fed at their word and i think they're caught flat footed now addition to the economy having to deal with inflation for a lot longer than they thought they would so there so does a lot of investors well i think that the the macro money that was looking at the overall economic conditions saw something pretty strong just as your previous guest noted you know the economy is going pretty well we've essentially gotten a huge easing of 100 basis points of of interest rates and stocks back at highs right and yet what we're seeing is that the market's expecting 160 basis points of interest rate cuts uh in the next year and that's seems unlikely when we've got growth above you know potential unemployment at secular lows and we've got a big boom
Regional Banks Proved Resilient in 2023,2023-12-19 13:15:05+00:00,3,nurQu1VHzRI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurQu1VHzRI,bob you tweeted the great deposit flight risk of 2023 didn't materialize despite high rates this is a legitimate concern for some people at least earlier in the year deposits have been pretty stable up for months now and before i hear quote but large time deposits are surging recognized that the 400 billion increase since svb is just 2% of the deposit base so what are this chart that we're looking at and what did not materialize well this is a a chart of the deposits uh the the blue one uh is the small small bank deposits and the red line is large bank deposits this is wild and why are the large bank deposits falling is that is that money markets yeah i mean that's basically people oh moving money that's cash sorting exactly and and the issue is that the large banks the big banks they're still offering you zero so your motivation to move right is higher is is higher actually at the large banks than small banks most people would have said it at least 6 months goes the opposite because they would have said the credit risk existed in the small banks but the small banks have gotten through and they're nims have been hit a little bit their net interest margins why aren't people leaving regional banks why ar there is no because there is no risk anymore there's no risk right no but why how come money how come money is coming out of large banks and going to money market they're paying one basis point of interest at the large reg banks are paying more and regional banks are two things one they're paying a bit more on average right but you know like the nim of you know comerica is is actually higher than the nim of bank of america so it's not you know it's not a radically different story and the other thing is we sort of talk about the benefit of transaction deposits in in you know small and regional banks because most of the banking that's happening there are people who are you know doing actual business right and if you're running a business you're not carefully managing exactly how much you know money market flow you have it's not an investment asset it's a business asset if you're you know i don't know building houses in topeka right the money comes in the money comes out you're not thinking about it you're not thinking about the credit risk of your bank and so it's not that surprising that the capital's all that you know that it's that sticky

Is The Fed Politically Influenced?,2023-12-17 13:15:00+00:00,4,2acPYwG-dB8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2acPYwG-dB8,so how much of fed policy do you think is dictated by who's in the white house including who is actually head of the fed and how do you sort of factor that into the analysis as we kind of move into an election year yeah well i think the folks who are at the fed today um deeply understand what their mandate is and their responsibility and are not going to be influenced by electoral politics and that's because it is not within the mandate of the governors of the federal reserve or the board to be responsive to or reflect a political opinion and so um that doesn't mean that there will never be in the future folks who are appointed to the fed that are primarily pursuing a political set of opinions but i'm saying today what we have is we have technocrats academics and people who have been appointed to that group group that are not political figures and so i think i i think there's far too much being done to suggest that the fed um that the fed far too much commentary that the fed is going to be meaningfully influenced by by the political calendar it's not going to happen right the fed is influenced by the outcome of political decisions like you know whether fiscal policy is loose or tight and whether that has an impact on the economy they may make decisions to not engage in policy choice is like right around the election point right before right after um you know for for reasons that i think are relatively obvious that there's no you know no tightening or easing at any point in time over a six or 12-week period makes any difference um but the fed has a long history over the course of the last couple of decades of tightening policy during election years easing policy during election years um pursuing uh what they think is right consistent with the macroeconomic realities of the day and so um you know at least for now the folks who are there are likely to continue to maintain their independence in terms of what they're doing what i'd emphasize though is that that is not necessarily always going to be the reality and if you look back through time there are es and flows in terms of how the fed how independent the fed has been as an entity separate from the federal government we've been in a period of time where the fed has been meaningfully independent for a long long time like 40 years but if you go back to the 70s what you see is the politicians met with the fed governor regularly um or if you go back to the post-war period uh in the 40s and the early 50s the fed and and treasury fed and and and the federal government were closely connected to each other so just because they happen to be independent today doesn't mean that they will be independent in the future it's just you know the only claim i'm making is at least with this administration with these people who are there today they're likely to operate pretty independently
Market Expectations for 2024,2023-12-16 13:15:03+00:00,6,kxj1wqVeB8A,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxj1wqVeB8A,what you think 2024 looks like because we came into 2023 everyone was universally bearish we were supposed to have a huge recession you know 2022 for those of us who are building companies and were operating in technology that felt like the depression uh you know like it could it was hard to imagine a scenario in 2023 that felt worse than the startup ecosystem did in 2022 i think in the beginning of 2023 it was a continuation of what we saw in 2022 but markets especially on the public side have rebounded quite a bit uh you know s&p as of this taping is either at or near the year to date highs bitcoin is is up like 180% this year even the nfts the altcoins like the riskier assets are are rallying um and i think a lot of people both on the institutional side and and the retail side are sort of confused like you know on one hand people don't want to miss some like huge rally if we are going to go back to you know bull market and on the other hand no one wants to sort of be the sucker that that buys this whatever this rip and then we flip the calendar and things roll over and they get smoked so how do you think things are setting up for 2024 on the equity markets to start yeah well i i think from a a macroeconomic dynamic and environment we um if you just think about where we are in the cycle that's you know that's what that's what the macro people start with um unemployment is at secular lows which means we're late in the cycle nominal growth remains relatively elevated compared to what is uh what needs to happen in order for the fed to durably meet its inflation mandate um and we've gotten a large effective easing over the course of the last month um as a result of uh in particular the treasury making a decision to limit bonds supply uh in the market as well as expectations that the fed will swiftly cut interest rates in response to falling inflation in 2024 and so what you see in terms of that combination of dynamics is a late cycle re reasonably strong growth like pretty good pretty good growth uh from a nominal perspective paired with an a a recent easing impulse the easing impulse is also supported by the falling gas falling gas prices which are also effectively like an you know an external easing that's occurring for the economy that would typically lead in 2024 you'd expect on a forward-looking basis for that to lead to continued economic strength right in the market right so a pretty good you know a pretty good environment until we get a sufficient amount of tightening to really put the breaks on the economy and so that's kind of where we stand today and what i'd emphasize is then you have to compare that if you're if you're trading macro markets you have to compare that picture what's happening today what's likely to happen with the macro economy with what's priced into the asset markets and what we see priced into the asset markets is 150 basis points of cuts by the fed in 2024 there's in fact a greater than 30% probability of more than 200 basis points of cuts in 2024 priced into the short rate market um so a lot of easing priced into the market whenever trading financial markets what you have to really do is you have to compare that perspective that that that outlook of what's likely to transpire with the macroeconomy you have to compare that to what's priced in to the asset markets and what's priced in to the asset markets right now is 150 basis point cuts by the federal reserve over the course of of 2024 and that's um would be surprising in the context of relatively strong growth growth uh in a late cycle economy typically that would lead to a continued tight or tightening policy and so that gap is likely to put pressure on in particular the short rate market and the bond market and you can sort of see some of that dynamic playing out actually today as we record this when a hot unemployment report uh was just printed earlier in the morning i think for stocks the picture is a little mixed which is that um stocks from a valuation perspective at are all-time highs and relative to other assets they're very very expensive they're at you know 30-year highs relative to other assets um what's priced into stocks or the expectations of stocks are continued relatively strong growth uh on a nominal basis what we're talking about here is that we're likely to see relatively strong growth but the problem is if we get that pressure in the in the bond market we're likely to you know with bond yields moving up and more tightening than expected we're likely to see a shift uh over time to you know stocks taking a hit from those rising rates and so we're more in an overall dynamic likely to be moving toward back towards what i'd call the higher for longer and really the high for longer environment
What Does 2 and 20 Mean?,2023-12-15 13:15:03+00:00,3,eFImJVXpI3k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFImJVXpI3k,when we talk about 2 in 20 you know what that is is actually compensation scheme which is a 2% of the aum fixed fee and a 20% of the profits in addition on an annual basis and um it's it's sort of a a catchall to refer to a number of these sort of sophisticated private fund type structures that all basically charge something close to that 2 and20 fee structure and so that includes hedge funds private equity venture capital private credit all of those different structure all those different um uh opportunity sets or or asset classes are typically structured in that 220 in that 2 and20 way and i think the challenge with 2 and20 particularly from the perspective uh of a of a taxable investor is uh one only the richest get access to those because of restrictions that are put into place or you either have to be uh accredited or most often actually qualified to get into those um big institutions so the vast majority of investors don't have access to them because of the regulatory constraints and then the second thing is the fee structure and the tax inefficient fund structure combined makes for a much less efficient way for investors to get access to that exposure so i'll just give you a very simple example standard headge funds they'll target let's say a 10% gross of fees returns right that's a good consistent you're not taking too much risk uh uh return so if you take that 10% fee or gross sorry if you take that 10% gross return structure you charge 2 and 20 for the fees now we've gone from 10 to six then the government the tax man he's going to take uh he's going to take 50% of that right because you're probably in the top marginal tax bracket and those funds are structured as ordinary income so now you're down to three your advisor is going to take one give or take that puts you down down to two and often for smaller scale investors you know even relatively wealthy investors they're using a platform of some sort that's also on top of it going to take let's say 50 basis points on top of it right so what what have we done we've gone from 10 to six to three to two to one and a half and you're like holy crap everyone in this world is getting paid based on this structure other than the person putting the money on the line right uh and that and that is the fundamental problem of the industry
Botany and The Macroeconomy: Two Big Complex Systems,2023-12-14 13:15:01+00:00,3,9X8oEsPBfog,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8oEsPBfog,like what what about investing really really sucked you in well i think that the the coming from a pure sciences background um you sort of see the world as you know a big system you know if you think about a plant uh and and the plant sciences you know all plant is is some intersection between you know the elements the and the plant development systems the asylum the flum these words that you probably remember back from when you were in you know high taking high school biology right in middle school biology right you may not even you've probably forgotten them uh photosynthesis is the only photosynthesis exactly exactly you remember that little cycle of photo sun coming in turning into sugars all that you know in in in a lot of ways having come you know a lot of a lot of my experience before i went to bridgewater was really in the pure sciences and you start to think about the world in the pure sciences particularly sort of in systematics as you know it's just a big complex system right of all these different pieces intersecting with with each other that creates the outcomes that you see um and you know what you're working to do as a scientist is understand you know all the different pieces of that great complexity in order to you know basically improve various things particularly in the plant sciences along the path when it comes to development and so in a lot of ways macro and the macroeconomy is very similar right it's a big complex system that you're trying to understand in a day-to-day basis i think the two things that i found particularly exciting about it uh instead of the sciences is we're al we're actors in the our own you know in the macroeconomy and so it's actually quite it gives you perspective on even why you and the people around you are doing the things that you're doing so i think that was very you know intellectually stimulating and interesting to me and then the second is the markets are a unique lens in terms of what's going on you know you basically if you think about it there's a complex macroeconomic system that's occurring at any point in time it's very hard to see all of those interlinking pieces right all the people buying their cars and doing this and you know taking out a mortgage and you know building a factory and all that stuff but one of the ways that you can see it is through the lens of the market right because the market are the markets are basically like windows into this complex system and what they do is they hold you accountable to to whether you know or don't know what the heck's going on right because you're either writ or you're wrong and it's a scoreboard that you can look at every day and so that really brought me to the to to markets cuz it it was it was this idea of understanding or trying to understand a comp a super complex system of which i'm in it combined with the fact that you get the kind of real world feedback that you basically get in no other industry which is great
Which Research Sources Help Shape Market Intuition?,2023-12-13 13:15:00+00:00,3,37AF5ZihqGc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37AF5ZihqGc,what do your actual like research look like or where do you where do you pull from to kind of you know figure out like what's going on in the market i know you mentioned your commute and but like where where are you looking to for for information yeah yeah i mean it it um it it it isn't that much different than you know what i've been doing for for 20 years now today is not that much different than the whole time um and and basically what that is is uh is going to bloomberg looking at the market action each day you know usually at the beginning of the day and the end of the day and when i see what's going on trying to understand understand what is driving the dynamics that are playing out in the markets like just like i said at the outset you know markets are like a lens into this crazy complicated macroeconomy right and so what i'm trying to do is look at the you know the currency market the equity market the bond market um look at those different markets commodity markets look at those markets and try and infer and understand what picture is being painted based upon that intermarket action and then connect that to the incrementally shifting information that we're getting through macroeconomic stats and policy announcements and things like that and so uh i mean honestly like the combination of you know uh you can get the like uh cheap bloomberg subscriptions so you get access to all the data on the app i think it's like 30 bucks a month with trading economics which is actually free which gives you all the major stats that are going on across the markets um with uh with uh you folks will see that i'm i'm a regular reader of something called the daily shot which is basically just a big pile of charts of the most interesting charts that get produced on the street every day you put those three things together that basically you know that that's as good as anything you're getting in an institutional environment um that pile of information and so it's just about taking that and thinking about it and going through that process like markets markets really to get great at markets it's not like you open a textbook and you read the thing and you get skilled or you open a model and you do this and you that you have to start to build this intuition and the way you build that intuition is like every single day going through that same process right it's not like a one-off thing where you just like learn and then understand and that's also the beautiful thing about markets which is you never understand everything that's going on right so you so it's so it's also driven by a curiosity every day i open up the you know this suite of different things and i'm looking at it and there's something new to learn something that i got got wrong very wrong right that i didn't understand that i can learn and that's the beautiful process
60/40 vs Alternative Strategies: What's the Difference?,2023-12-12 13:15:00+00:00,3,8QrDZAZaIrU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QrDZAZaIrU,there's a reason like if you go to the biggest institutional investors in the world they have about 50% of their assets in these alternative investment strategies about 50% is in sort of 60 40 liquid markets 50% in alternative investment strategies and these are folks who could invest in literally any asset in the world the reason why they put so much capital in those investment those alter alternatives is because they generate such a high quality they typically generate such a high quality what we call risk adjusted return which is the amount of return you're getting relative to the amount of volatility you're taking on uh on an ongoing basis so the 6040 liquid market that you referred to that 60% equities 40% fixed income roughly speaking and then there's this whole world of alternatives that they're taking advantage of i think a lot of people would be surprised to hear that that it's potentially less risky yeah well i think um part of the reason why that is is that these strategies are really centered on um finding the best opportunities in the market if you invest in let's say the s&p 500 right there's a lot of there's a lot of risk in the s&p 500 there's lots of companies that uh you know could do well at certain times but also could do poorly at at other times and uh and have done poorly right over the last you we've had three draw downs of 30 plus percent over the last 25 years right in the stock market and what for instance in in the fund bace what what those managers are looking to do is find uh opportunities that generate similar returns but just have less risk so buying uh assets or companies that are more cheaply priced or using other instruments like uh hedges i mean in the hedge fund space right hedges that can uh help protect in the event of downside risk in the market and really when you look at these strategies in many ways they're pretty boring to look at because what they are uh are that they generate pretty good returns when things are doing well and they gen and they basically limit they preserve capital when things aren't doing well and if you put those two things together actually that generates a pretty good return over time with a lot less volatility so it's more around the sort of like in many ways almost boring prudent risk management that is driving a lot of the uh outperformance on a return relative to risk basis
What's Occurring in Markets and What's Likely to Happen (in Dec 2023),2023-12-11 13:15:03+00:00,4,ZnqG24ZIY3g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnqG24ZIY3g,what we've um what we've set up here is uh markets that are pricing in basically an all-in bet on the soft landing now for those of you who are tracking the macroeconomy and markets you know there's been this big debate are we going to have a soft landing a hard landing some people have talked about no landing but the basic idea the basic question is can we have inflation come down uh closer to the fed's target without having a meaningful slowing of economic conditions that's the soft landing camp right a hard landing would that economic conditions growth would slow down a lot relative you know in order to bring inflation down and so i think when you look at market pricing it really is a lens into how people are netting out in terms of their expectations of what's likely to transpire and i think today when you scan across markets you know i really see an all-in bet on soft landing so if you look at stocks they're really not that much not that far off of highs particularly when you consider the fact that bond yields have risen considerably which should have a negative impact on the stock price and you look at bonds which you you know continue to price in relatively low expect inflation oil prices are very low actually they they're about about as low on a real basis as they've been in a very long time and the fed's priced in to cut 100 basis points over the course of 2024 which really is goldilocks not so much so many cuts that it would be indicative of a real grow slowdown but cutting a little bit as inflation is expected to fall so you listen to all that and you sort of say all in the markets are basically saying we're definitely having a soft landing growth is super strong and inflation comes down and the fed eases a little bit and everything is perfect and the odds that that happens are they're not zero but they're certainly not 100% the way it's priced into markets today okay so what i'm hearing is is that even though the market has priced in what it's priced in it sounds like you may have an alternative opinion or perspective on that i'm just curious where do you see the markets going from what you're looking at now yeah i think a lot of the things um that i'm focused on is how if might be more challenging to achieve that soft landing scenario than i think many people or the markets expect if you look back through time uh beating inflation once you've already had a high inflationary period without a slowdown in growth is actually quite challenging uh very very rarely does that occur and so what that means from a markets perspective is that in order to bring inflation down to the fed's mandate odds are we're going to have to have weaker economic conditions than are currently priced into the equity market um which would be bad for stocks and then on the flip side we probably need to have tighter monetary policy than is currently priced into the short rate markets where the fed holds higher for longer than those 100 basis points of cuts priced in to 2024 and so you put that together it's actually probably not a great environment for both stocks and bonds and i know a lot of folks have already felt the pain of 6040 underperforming over the course of the last 18 to 24 months but until we bring inflation that back durably to the fed's target we're unlikely to see that 6 40 portfolio perform anywhere near as well as it has you know over the course of the last couple of decades
Investment Diversification and Curiousity Are Key for Traders,2023-12-10 13:15:02+00:00,3,qCzy_QZXqaQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCzy_QZXqaQ,how important is it on say diversity as far as being a good investor particularly in your world yeah well i think it connects to another critical point which is part of the connection to discipline is also recognizing uh that you're going to be wrong a lot like even the very best i'm i'm saying the the people who are the absolute very best in this business are only right 5545 on any one trade in any one month so what that means is 45% of the time you're going to be wrong right and so one of the ways to deal with that and that's the practical reality like you can't get better than that so it's not worth trying to be like well i think i'm smarter than the you know most sophisticated asset managers in the world right except that that's you know that's a good winning percentage and so one of the things that you want to do given that is you want to improve your your your overall portfolio through diversification and all diversification is it's a really it's a really simple idea it can sound very complex but it's basically saying look if you have an edge if you have a 5545 edge well then what you want to do is you want to put as many bets on the table as you can because every time you take that bet what happens is you probably will win and if you just take one bet you know the odds that you do do all right are only you know are only so good but if you do that over 10 bets or if you do it over 20 or 100 bets if you do it through time right you get that diversification through time that will really help you make the most of whatever edge you have in the market man brilliant so we we've talked about trading systems we've talked about diversification what would be a third leave behind that you can leave for our fans around the world yeah yeah i mean i think the last thing i'd say is that the best traders uh in the world that i talk to are sort of um relentlessly curious about how they could be wrong and that that is in the world in the world people are often uh benefited by having uh consistency in a way of thinking right they in in a position say you're a politician right you're like i'm you know i have the strong view on x y and z and i will be consistent in that view and in markets that will kill you right what you want to do because there as you said you know markets are a constantly learning and evolving game right you're constantly have to learn and adapt and understand and evolve and recognize that you're wrong and and change when you recognize that you're wrong in a certain position or or a certain dynamic and so part of the way that the best traders operate is that they they have this sort of relentless curiosity about how they could be wrong they seek alternate views right not in a i'm going to have a debate with the person but you a genuine open-minded how could i be wrong what could i learn from those alternative use and so you see you know you see that process and in some ways like one of the best ways to to to enable that in your day-to-day operation of of trading of whatever is for every trade that you do where you have all the reasons why you're very long you know you're very confident in your view write down the reasons why you could be wrong because what that'll allow you to do is as you put that bet on through time what you can see is are things happening closer to what i would consider me you know making this trade wrong or are they closer to what i expected in order to make the trade right
What an S&P 52-Week High Means in Dec 2023,2023-12-09 13:15:03+00:00,2,XlnNyOgUgWo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlnNyOgUgWo,joining us now bob elliott from unlimited and brook may from evans may wealth guys welcome bob what's your assessment of how the market digested this jobs report with the 10-year hire but the major indices also hire led by energy and tech well i think we're back to the environment of hire for longer that we saw over the summer and in early 2023 here where uh the job market remains relatively strong there's no good reason why the fed needs to proactively ease monetary policy in this environment and that is particularly bad for the bond market because there are still five to six cuts priced in for 2024 so bad for bonds good for stocks because growth continues uh fueled by those wage gains uh of strong employment and the combination of which is you know in many ways just continuing the type of dynamics that we've seen uh higher for longer for for a long time now
Suggested  Best Practices for Investors,2023-12-08 20:15:00+00:00,3,5CkKoS_R31o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CkKoS_R31o,what are about say three things that you could leave behind for our guest from your perspective in this industry just to give them some competitive advantages well i think a couple things come to mind uh you know the the the first one is that you have to have uh non-consensus ideas that i think is a really important thing when you're thinking about financial markets um which is the basic idea that you know just like we talked about in order to understand what's likely to transpire right in order to make money in markets you have to have a view that's different from what priced in and so what you have to be constantly doing is looking at what's priced into the markets thinking carefully about what's likely to occur and then comparing those two things in order to come to a view all too often people basically just repeat what the consensus thinking is about what's happening in financial markets rather than thinking about where the pricing is wrong because it's really that gap between what's likely to happen and where pricing is that's where uh what we call alpha which is that's where you get outperformance relative to simply passive investing and so that's a critical thing to constantly keep in mind as you're um as you're thinking about investing or and trading market awesome i love it when it comes down to you know i can see you're very disciplined and you have a very disciplined approach and some of the best traders are and one of those things comes into developing systems i'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about developing a trading system yeah well i mean in terms of the other thing uh another one to definitely highlight in terms of lessons learned is uh is thinking systematically you know i think all too often a lot of us have ideas you know intuitions about what's likely to transpire in marcus what how the world works etc and i think one of the challenges is there's really two challenges as an investor one is assessing whether your ideas are actually good and that's where systemization that idea of basically taking the idea and checking to see if back through time that was a good idea or not and whether that would be a good way to trade markets or not through more sample size um is really beneficial and then the other thing that people often fail at when they're investing is that they're insufficiently disciplined and this isn't like a a moral judgment trading markets is super hard there's a lot of information coming out out at you at any point in time and it's frankly hard to process all that information in a way that's rigorous and so one of the things you can do is write down your rules say if i see this happen and i know that it's a good idea then i will go do this other thing if i see you know the stock market go down below the 200 day moving average then i'll do you know then i'll short the stock market let's just say that's a that's a plausible rule that you could you could do well there's always going to be a information coming at you that might knock you off your course but if you have discipline through systemization you can more rigorously adhere to the rules or the approaches that you know will work over time and that will help you outperform that will help you succeed in your investment strategies uh through time
Macro Webinar December 2023,2023-12-08 13:15:06+00:00,57,oNxDbnfOLKk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNxDbnfOLKk,[music] uh thank you all for joining us for this monthly macro webinar uh for december 20123 let's get started i think the biggest thing to recognize for the us economy and really for the global economy uh is over the last month since we last got together uh there has been a significant easing that has occurred in the context of a very late cycle environment and so when you look at what's going on in the us economy to start what do we see we still see secularly low unemployment conditions we see nominal growth that continues to be relatively elevated uh compared to what's appropriate for the fed's mandate and we've seen in the most recent period really since the uh the announcement of the november qra announcement a significant financial easing now we've long talked about how uh this hot economy requires higher interest rates lower and lower stock prices in order to kick off a process that would sufficiently loosen labor markets bring down wage growth and allow the fed to meet its mandate and what happened uh on november 1st is we took a relatively substantial step back by the treasury uh announcing that they would uh have much less issuance than what what was expected the response to that was a relatively significant bond yield move downward uh and coincident with that was an equity move upward and so what we've seen over the course of the last you know 35 days is basically a total and complete unwind of the tightening dynamics that had existed in the previous couple of months and that's really what you see here in this chart this is the goldman sachs financial conditions index you could pick a bunch of different indexes it doesn't really matter what we've basically seen is a complete reversal and so while we were talking about we a complete reversal to where we were over the summer and so in the summer we were having a conversation about how the us economy was running too hot and needed uh tighter conditions in order to slow the economy in order for the fed to meet its mandate it looked like we were on that path that would get us in that direction and that's basically totally reversed and in many ways has reversed more than i think most people would have expected given uh the magnitude of the policy announcements uh that occurred in early november so we've taken a step back you can see that across asset markets where basically everything that happened uh from the summer until uh halloween has reversed you can see in the upper right hand chart the upper leftand chart that you know the stock market is basically back to high nearby highs and only 5% off of all-time highs on a total return basis the two-year rate has fallen considerably from well above five into the mid fours uh you see the tenure rate you know which peaked right at five has fallen uh down into the low fours you know we've seen almost 90 basis points of long end easing as a function of this and the term premium which had finally started to rise going into this period has now you know reversed basically most of that recent rise and we're left back with where we started and in the context you know there's a lot of times when an easing like this would be appropriate for an economy particularly if the economy was running slow but that's not the situation where the us economy uh is sitting right now we're in a late cycle environment and nominal growth is too strong maybe not quite as strong as what the third quarter gdp print was you know well above 8% but even nominal growth in the 5 to 6% range is going to meaningfully outstrip the productive capacity growth of the economy plus the mediocre labor force growth so you don't need anything like what we saw in the third quarter to continue to put pressure on wages and prices through the economy at this point as a function of the significant shifts that have occurred in market pricing there is a significant easing priced into the short rate market for 20124 uh i think this uh this chart gives you sort of a good sense of the actual distribution uh that uh that these that's priced into the market and what you see right now is the first cuts are starting to get priced in for january and then on top of it if you look at the the the curve for the the distribution of plausible outcomes we see that there's a 33% chance pricing 100 basis points of cuts by june and a roughly similar probability of almost 200 basis points of cuts of 200 basis points of cuts priced in by december the median point now by the end of december is somewhere between five and six cuts based upon the market pricing now that is a pretty extraordinary easing that's expected in the short rate market in the context of an economy that just printed an 8% nominal gdp growth measure uh in the previous quarter and that has secularly low unemployment conditions and i think a lot of what's going on in terms of the macro environment is it's really predicated that that set of pricing is really predicated on the expectation a that inflation is be has is fully beat and b that we're going to have a situation where the fed is going to respond to the inflationary dynamics by cutting interest rates relatively aggressively in order to maintain a fall to maintain real rates in the way that they see it now that may happen or it may not happen but those are the two expectations that are essentially priced into the market uh the way that the pricing is right now inflation is beat and the fed is going to be highly responsive to that circumstance by cutting interest rates we'll talk a little bit more about that later but it's important to keep that in mind i go back to this i know i've started a few webinars the last couple of months with this this ordering but i think the ordering is really important to recognize once again how do we get from an economy that is running hot to an economy that has slowed sufficiently in order to moderate inflationary pressures it isn't magic it takes steps those steps the steps that are required are that interest rates need to rise which then creates uh falling of equity prices which then creates slowing demand which then flows through to earnings declines labor market weakness wage growth moderation and finally getting to that point of inflation falling durably to the fed's mandate if we look at this ordering we've basically set ourselves back almost 6 months in terms of how this is playing out as the tightening of financial conditions which were starting to move us on this path right with the rise in bond yields and the decline in equity prices that is all reversed and instead we're back to a situation we're back to where we started uh over the summer and in many ways what we're seeing is an expectation that the fed will be highly accommodating of this circumstance now all of this easing that's priced in as i said is really very much predicated on falling inflation that inflation is beat and that uh the waller cuts as i like to call them are the path that the fed is going to pursue now i'll i'll mention i'll highlight in many ways what's priced into the market right now in terms of the the interest rate cuts that are priced in are consistent with the types of cuts that were outlined by waller right before the most recent blackout period that's important to recognize because it means that if you believe that that the fed is going to take that path that path is already fully priced in that is already reflected in equity and bond markets and so in order to believe that in order to hold uh to go you know long short rates or long bonds at this point you have to believe that there will be meaningfully more cuts than what is currently priced because what is already priced is a perfect move of inflation to 2% and the fed tracking that and maintaining a real rate maintaining the existing real rate by cutting interest rates 150 basis points so you have to believe that there's going to be something uh substantially greater than that amount of cuts in order to go long two years or long short rates like december 24 so first right now and and you know that's not going to take just a fallen inflation that's going to take a relatively substantial weakening in growth but before we get there and i want to i want to talk about that in a minute before we get there let's talk about this inflation picture we have obviously seen inflation moderate relatively considerably over the course of the last you know six or nine months and at this point we've seen a couple of headline and core inflation prints which are in the ballpark of what the fed's mandate looks like and many people will go ahead and put in all all sorts of different slices in ways that if you take core headline inflation over a moderate term like three or six months uh you know what it looks like is we're we're at or just above the fed's mandate and even more so if you take certain market-based prices like apartment rents and things like that you know we basically there's a there's an argument a common argument that basically inflation's beat the fed is done they've met their mandate there's nothing more to do but i would uh i would pause on that point and really wrestle with the question of whether or not this economy and the us economy has durably brought the inflation back down to 2% and that durable point is such a critical component when both you're thinking about the path of monetary policy and as the fed is thinking about what is the appropriate monetary policy for the economy because it's not about touching a 2% inflation target it's about durably bringing inflation down to that 2% target and i think some of the main concerns that the fed and others have when it comes to thinking about that durable question is what we've seen over the course of the last year really and even more acutely over the last couple of months is that inflation has come down but it's come down driven by relatively significant disinflationary forces which may not be able to be persistent and so i highlight two charts here because i think they're two good uh good ind indications of what has brought this inflation down which you see here on the left hand side in the middle chart we've had a big fall in gas prices first of all the big fall of gas prices from $5 to $3 was a huge disinflationary impulse which helped bring things down in part driven by the spr release and other uh other dynamics going on we've had another disinflationary move in gas prices over the last couple of weeks that is the the flow through of that weakening gas gas those weakening gas prices is a critical component of creating disinflationary forces in the economy and certainly very critical to keeping that headline inflation number quite low but gas prices will not fall forever and that's the important thing to consider because it's not about is there a moment of 2% inflation it's about whether this level of inflation can persist and so it's highly depend what we're seeing today the reports that we see today and over the course of the next couple months months are highly dependent on a continued fall in oil prices which may which very well may not happen i'd also emphasize on the other side uh which you see all the way on the right here uh the fall in used cars used car prices which is a really important component of bringing disinflationary uh dynamics into the into goods prices and again that's fallen something like 15 or 20% on a year-over-year basis has represented a big disinflation ar impulse um and been a critical component of bringing the reported numbers down but the question is will that persist and how long can that persist maybe it persists for the next six months but will it persist in a way that durably brings inflation down to the 2% mandate over time and at some point there will be a natural bottoming of these used car prices and we're probably not all that far away from that when you think about what the shifts in these prices have been in the context of overall price increases in the economy i mean for instance overall price increases in the economy uh since you know since the co began have been about 20% so you know used car prices uh being in line with that broader price pressure in the economy would probably fall to like 180 you know we're not that we're not that far away from that and when that stops from deflating to being flat it's going to take a huge disinflationary pressure out of the economy the same story is true for things like airfares which are oil dependent and other things like that and so that's where um i think a lot of folks are are sitting saying i think you know the resolution of the supply side has allowed us to create immaculate disinflation and they've you know to the fed's mandate and they've been right about that you that's true in a measured sense and in a short-term sense but the question is will it persist and when those and it will only persist when those disinflationary pressures start to go back to sort of normal uh price growth right and you have all the other pressures in the economy start to keep price growth levels at 2% and can that happen and that's what that's why you probably uh for many of you who are following me regularly are probably sick and tired to be talking about wages and how wages are t are critical to understanding what the structural drive of inflation are but that's why the wage conversation is so critically important because once those disinflationary pressures wash out and move back closer to zero what we'll be left with is nominal wage growth relative to nominal productivity growth in the economy and that will determine what the structural inflationary pressures are and when you look at what that picture looks like we still have secularly tight labor markets they're not moving much they're not really deteriorating and that is creating wage pressures in the economy so that's what you see over here on the lefthand side right that 3.9% unemployment rate um is you know continuing to put pressure on wages uh we see it in the eci which has stabilized at a level that's meaningfully higher than where it was preco you see it in the atlanta fed wage growth tracker which also has stabilized over you know since august the monthly numbers have stabilized since august uh basically at that just about 5% that's a couple percent above what the level of growth rate was preco that's creating structural pressure in the economy and until we see the labor markets meaningfully weaken these pressures will remain in the economy and so far and you know i wrote a tweet about it earlier today if you scan across all the different pressures in the economy all the labor market pressures in the economy what you see is that the labor market is is just chopping sideways sure we've had a bit of loosening that has existed um over the course of the last you know six or nine months we went from a 2022 labor market that was screaming hot almost unreasonably screaming hot back to a labor market that is tight and tight on par with what we saw in 18 and 19 preco but the difference today the difference today is in those nominal price expectations and the accumulated gap in real wage growth and as a result what we're likely to see is continued pressure on nominal wages to at this level of unemployment just because we're at the same level of unemployment today as we were in 2018 and 2019 doesn't mean we'll get the same level of wage growth right because the because of two important points one is that the expectations of price increases today are radically different than they were 5 years ago and number two is that the level of real wages continues to trail uh continues to trail longer term norms so we've basically had zero real wage growth over the course of the last four years and that's important because as people are trying to uh as people are negotiating their wages they still feel that pressure of being behind both of which create that a tight labor market those those uh expectations are creating a situation where wage growth persists now in addition to that um i'd emphasize that there are other things going on in the market that are um that don't that certainly raise questions about whether we're on the fast track to inflation being beat forever one of the ones in the middle the the points that i show here in the middle is that it's not clear that housing inflation is beat on a level basis rent cpi continues to trail the levels of asked for rents uh here shown by zillow but across a number of different measures and the and the uh bls's uh favorite measure which is the new tenant repeat rate uh continues to be on a level basis relatively elevated in comparison to reported cpi rent those two charts in the middle and what that means is that the that even though you might be seeing printed or published rents uh at zero or slightly positive it doesn't mean that cpi will come in that way anytime soon uh because there still continues to be a level catchup that needs to occur for uh the home ownership costs that get measured in cpi and so the idea that everything is done and this is not to mention the fact that now we have house prices rising on a likeforlike basis at almost 1% a month which is continuing to put pressure on rental cost rental uh prices as well you put that all together it's certainly not clear that you know the rent problem is beat in the us and then finally i i i guess i touched on it briefly here but it is particularly notable that we're seeing inflation expectations remain elevated at a time when they should be falling relatively significantly now this should be giving the fed a significant concern because typically these inflation expectations move with oil prices oil prices come down a lot people's inflation expectations moderate but what we're seeing is a dynamic that we haven't seen in a very long time which is that despite the fall in oil prices and gas prices what we're seeing is that inflation expectations either remain elevated or actually rising modestly uh in the medium to longer term and so what you're seeing here is that that's the problem like that's the problem connected back to the wages which is we haven't beat the fed has not beat the inflationary dynamic that exists in in the everyday consumers minds and therefore to the extent that labor markets remain tight right tight as they are today you're going to continue to see that wage growth and so this idea that what's going to happen is wage inflation's beat and we're all done and there's nothing there wage inflation's beat headline inflation's beat the fed's ready to cut a ton it just certainly doesn't it just doesn't line up with with the evidence that you see if you if you think about the problem more holistically than just the reported numbers over the course of the last couple of months and of and the fed is thinking that way and i think it's a big part of why uh you know ch pal continuously back over and over and over again keeps bringing up that uh that inflation is still not yet be a lot of folks uh along the way are pointing to uh the bond market rally and saying hey i actually think you know bonds must know something and if there's one thing we've learned uh over the course of the last couple of years is that the bond market may not be the smart money i mean how many times have we gone through this process where a massive amount of cuts get priced into the market remember the short rate market priced in for c in in uh in march of 2023 the bond market and the short rate market priced in four cuts in 2023 where are our four cuts right totally uh to expectations that were totally inconsistent with how the economy played out because the economy was much more resilient uh than than folks expected similarly we're we're basically seeing a repeat of that pattern which is a whole lot of cuts are being expected and then in many cases what folks are doing is they're looking at the bond market and they're saying look bonds are rallying hard they must be telling us something about what's going on but i think what we're seeing today in many ways is a repeat and a more extreme repeat of what we saw in late 2022 that set our set ourselves up for a pretty big bond sell off in the beginning of the year and what that is is we've had a big underperformance of long-term bonds relative to stocks over the course of the year long-term bonds uh through thanksgiving were down about 25% relative to stocks what that mechanically does is for big institutional investors that have targets for stocks and bonds allocation they must rebalance back into the underperforming asset and they typically do that somewhat sometimes at quarter end but almost always are doing that right there before the end of the year but in in that thanksgiving period through the end of the year and increasingly what we're seeing is that um is that fast money hedge funds are recognizing that this is a typical dynamic and are in some ways front running the actual flows and so what you saw in 2022 in late 2022 with that red line which is thanksgiving uh noted is after a period of some underperformance of bonds relative to stocks you saw a pretty good bid for bonds for a few weeks through december 17th and then what happened was the fast money sold it to the actual rebalancing and bonds came back down i think we're probably seeing a similar dynamic where but only at a larger scale where the significant amount of underperformance of bonds is creating that short-term rebalancing which is putting pressure on bonds and obfuscating uh the positive growth dynamics the positive liquidity dynamics that have come from this easing and showing up as a bond rally now that can persist for so long but my guess is we're going to start to see the pressures ease off of the bond market um and equities will outperform bonds as that rebalancing pressure starts to fade um and you know if anything today is a bit of looked like a bit of an example of that exact dynamic playing out and that's where tactically even though uh you know what we've seen is that this is this dynamic which is this balancing dynamic has really pushed hard on bonds when we take a step back and look at the overall picture and we say what does what does this economy look like what are what are the sort of pressures tactical pressures on asset prices right now in many ways they're in the opposite direction right the economy was running hot uh and got some tightening which is now reversed in many ways has gotten a gotten a real easing uh you know with stocks rallying the way that they have and interest rates falling the way that they have that dynamic should be good for stocks and bad for bonds as the economy on a forward-looking basis is getting a stimula stimulative impulse and if anything it's actually getting a bigger stimulative impulse than it would otherwise get just from the market action because we've had that fall in oil prices which basically just translate straight into consumer pockets and is a mini stimulus check for them as well and so strong economy stimulus that has basically emerged over the last six weeks should lead to stocks outperforming bonds in many ways what we saw uh following you know once the svb thing uh sort of got washed through the market we may in early 2024 see a repeat of what we saw in may through july in 2023 and also what we saw in early 2023 as well before the svb situation occurred because as you go back to this framework when we're in the first part of this framework which is where we are right now remember stocks should outperform bonds during an environment of higher for longer and that's because of this ordering which is first the bond yields rise and then the stocks fall i think it's interesting uh just taking us a step back more globally to look at the picture uh including europe which i think is is quite interesting um eur the european dynamics that are going on are totally different than what they are in the us but what we're seeing is a situation where the pricing of cuts in europe and the us are the same for 2024 despite the fact that economic conditions are radically different and so what we see first of all is uh on the short end real rates in europe are are now quite elevated a big reason why that is is because core inflation has been very soft running basically at zero over the course of the last couple of months we're seeing inflation measures uh market-based inflation measures collapsing in europe reflecting the fact that the economies there are meaningfully deteriorating uh o over the course of the last three or six months but yet we're seeing 150 basis points of easing in europe uh at a time when uh you know when the the dynamics you know 150 basis points of easing in europe which is the same amount of easing that's basically priced into the us curve but there's a huge difference between economy shrinking and having zero inflation versus the us economy which is at you know where unemployment is at secular lows and growth is pretty strong and we've gotten a big easing two radically different economies and circumstances pricing in essentially the same dynamics through the course of 2024 i think that's probably the divergence between the us and european economy and the and the policy divergences that we're likely to see through the course of 2024 are probably some of the one of the more interesting crosscutting global dynamics uh that we're likely to see now i'm gonna you know i've talked a fair amount here about um about how the market environment uh favor stocks relative to bonds given the tactical dynamics of play i think it was i would be remiss if i didn't uh take a step back a little bit and talk you know in many ways also about the strategic asset allocation dynamics that exist today so any any short-term tactical bet is only uh is only so good you know you know any one particular bet is something like 6040 over a one month time frame on a longer time frame uh say three years five years 10 years for most investors what drives uh the outcomes of their portfolios for those who are not tactically trading on a day-to-day basis is valuations and while in this moment uh the dynamics look as though they favor stocks relative to bonds you have to take a step back and at least acknowledge that on a longer term basis equity heavy portfolios look to are set to meaningfully underperform uh a more diversified portfolio from a strategic perspective because the valuation dynamics have become so extraordinarily stretched when it comes to the value uh you know the the valuation of equities relative to other assets now some of you who have been following us for a long time might be familiar with a strategic uh asset allocation portfolio that i developed and wrote about about nine months ago which i call the simple game plan the basic idea of the simple game plan is create a portfolio that is uh that is not so reliant on the secular disinflationary strong growth wave that we've seen in the us economy over the course of the last 40 years so moving away from the 6040 portfolio and recognizing that the biggest risk for investors is a situation in which assets underperform for an extended period of time and where inflation is elevated the simple game plan portfolio uh you could think about it uh basically broken up into two pieces one piece is a long-term strategic portfolio a beta portfolio is what we call it um that represents about 60% of the portfolio and that is structured as as u as a a risk parity portfolio tilted towards uh commodity holdings because the biggest risk for investors is inflation when it comes to their purchasing power and on the other side includes or increases the amount of tactical uh allocations in the portfolio to help navigate through challenging market environments including a 20% allocation to managed futures or trend following as well as a 20% allocation to balanced alpha strategies that portfolio uh has what you see here is comparing the traditional 60/40 portfolio which is highly dominated by stocks compared to that simple game plan portfolio over the last few years and what you see is that the continued uh relatively significant outperformance of us stocks has meant that a diversified a much more diversified and agile portfolio hasn't outperformed a stock heavy portfolio in the last four years years and the reason why that is is because equity outcomes have been extreme relative to long-term history whereas the asset returns of other assets the returns of other assets have been quite modest relative to history and so i i think in a lot of ways uh when you think about your sort of strategic portfolio uh it is it a prudent portfolio or prudent portfolio allocation ations in many ways have been the worst portfolios that you could have held for the last 15 years but it doesn't mean that on a forward-looking basis you should give up on diversification because these sorts of dynamics that we've seen postco and even you know since the gfc they will not persist for forever and just to give some context into in terms of how extreme this is when thinking about how uh whether you want to hold an equity overweight portfolio the lehand chart simply shows stock returns relative to trend versus the returns of all other assets relative to trend those two pieces are shown zoomed in on the right and what you see is that stocks from a valuation perspective are at their highest level relative to all other financial assets meaning bonds credit commodities gold etc then they've been basically other than three points in two other points in history that is the peak of the tech bubble and 1929 and so when you think about building a strategic portfolio and i should say and the reason why that is is a balance between the fact that equity returns that's what you see on the right hand side shown in gold are elevated those those returns are elevated relative to history but the important thing to recognize is that other asset prices and their returns are very low relative to history and so the com the the balance between those the the relative performance between those it's what's creating such an incredible divergence in terms of stock valuation relative to all other assets can this persist like any value measure of course it can persist but there will be a day there will be a time when um when the tightening cycle has played out sufficiently and where stocks will underperform other financial assets and so the question as a longer term strategic asset allocator is whether or not you want to be overweight equities over the course of the next three five 10 years when the valuation divergences sit as extreme as they are today so i'd emphasize while in the short term it does look like you want to favor stocks relative to bonds and that is a tactical view that makes makes a lot of sense given the dynamics at play a strategic asset allocation which is what the vast majority of investors should be thinking about should not be nearly as overweight stocks as they currently are today given these longer term valuations with that i'll move it here to the audience questions thank you all for uh submitting them uh and uh i'll try and run through as many as i can here in the time that we have uh available um i think uh question here i'll run through a few of the pres submitted questions um one question here which is what is the probability that the recession begins soon um and and what i'd say to that is i i think it's pretty uh in order for a recession to occur you need a negative economic momentum and a meaningful tightening and and that's really what you want you want to bring those two points together right negative economic momentum tightening which then kicks off a process of slowing the economy and tilting it into recession often a a self-reinforcing process right that the negative economic trend starts to create weakness in asset prices particularly stock prices which then feeds back and creates the downward cycle stock prices today are reaching new highs bond yields haven't been this low in a long time right housing conditions mortgages those cyclical dynamics are actually on the margin tilting up not down because of that stimulation so when you look through the econ you know consumer consumer buying has actually picked up as a function of the lower oil prices and higher stock prices those are the sorts of dynamics that you typically would not see with a near immediate recession right what you typically see is those things would have to be deteriorating for a period of time as the leading indicators of the economy and you' need to see the tightening dynamics playing out through the economy to get to recession and so a lot of ways i know probably a few months ago we we had one of these webinars look like the storm clouds were building that was before there were almost 100 basis points of interest rate easing and more than 10% stock returns uh 10% um positive returns in stocks that has set us back something like six months the conditions look a lot like they are in the summer we are starting to see actually the real world consequences of those decisions and that's the sort of set of conditions that would not align with a recession that would occur over the next 3 to six months um next question uh can the uh uh are we likely to see a yield curve normalizing uh at this point you know with interest rates around four another question here which is you know is it possible that the the long-term interest rates fall even more than they are today so what i i think about in that question is what's priced in what's priced in is 150 basis points of cuts in the near term and a zero term premium and and zero doesn't mean anything in particular it's just it's just a measure it's a way to get a sense as to what the conditions look like um and so we basically you know we have those cuts priced in we've had a full reversal of the term premium both of those dynamics are place and if you're going to buy bonds or buy short rates in this environment what you have to believe is you have to believe that conditions will be meaningfully or conditions will be such that the fed will have to do a lot more than currently priced in the the only way that i see that happening is if we have a relatively significant deterioration in growth uh as well as a significant decline in stocks and so um and as i just said the economic momentum and the incremental tightening and easing would align with thing with the conditions moving in the opposite direction so we're seeing and this is very normal which is in many ways it's a self-defeating process a self-defeating process that we've seen a few times over the course of the last couple of years where a bunch of easing gets priced in that's stimulative to the economy right which means that the dynamics that would have had to occur to to engender that sort of weakening that sort of ease ing are actually feeling pressures in the opposite direction and so that's really i think what we're going to see over the course of the next 3 to six months so the odds that we're going to see rates get pushed lower from here in a meaningful way i i think the odds are skewed in the opposite direction given the macroeconomic momentum and the incremental policy and market easing that we've seen let's hit a few uh of the questions that you folks uh the few live questions that you folks have uh jumped in uh the fed and and chairman pow if you have questions if you could chuck them into the uh question and answer tab thing because it's goingon to be easier for me to to to look through them there uh the fed and chairman powell are well aware of the easing i presume they are uh if they look at the market so why no push back why let waller go out and say what what he said i think two things first of all what's priced in the market is what waller said so you have to believe the fed is going to be easier than what waller said in terms of their policy path in december in order to buy you know in 24 in order to buy those rates so that's what you have to believe very important if you're trading markets that you're trading what's priced in i i i think you know we've gotten to this world of reading a bunch of tea leaves of what a variety of different folks said said other uh other fed governors came out and said things that were inconsistent with what waller said i think in a lot of ways the market is really you know um uh focusing on a set of policy uh conversations or policy comments that are aligned in their best interest combined with the fact of some of these uh the shorter term dynamics uh that i highlighted that are driving bond yields down you know as a in in the short term as a function of rebalancing pressure but i wouldn't necessarily assume that just because one fed governor says one thing and one fed governor says the other that it is necessarily the policy decisions or even the the median policy expectation on a forward-looking basis what i'd emphasize is focus on the macroeconomic linkages the macroeconomic linkages show a growth an economy that's doing pretty well that's very late cycle that's just got about of stimulation and that is not the type of economy that will lead to a significant number of cuts and just and just having your mind chairman powell uh uh more than a year ago said that the neutral rate of the economy was like two and a half per. so and obviously did something totally different and has learned very differently what the actual ne neutral rate of the economy is and so what i what i'd highlight or he said two and a half perc was tight even tight at that time right transitioning to tight policy just because they say things doesn't mean that's what their policy actions going to be what they're going to do is focus on the macroeconomic data and so honestly we'd all be a lot better off if we just sto listening to these folks as they're out there chattering around giving conflicting signals and instead just focused on the macroeconomics and what's likely to transpire um i think we hit that uh hit that um i think you know i think the question here is how long the question here is you know what it looks like right now is we have a goally lock scenario and i think that that that's right and what do we mean by goldilocks um you know in a lot of ways it looks like where we were in early 23 where inflation looked like it was coming down and growth is still fine right totally fine you know how long can we go through that process and i think um the answer is that we can go through that process for a period of time in particular while measured inflation moderates or is low and growth holds up but the question is can that persist without starting to create pressures in the bond market to go up which is sort of the opposite of goldilocks or for where we're not not seeing enough labor market deterioration or wage pressure moderation so that when those disinflationary pressures start to fade that we get inflation moving back clearly above the fed's mandate and so we could easily be in a circumstance here from the macroeconomic data standpoint where we see reasonable growth and low measured inflation that you know exists for three or six months but that doesn't mean that that's the path for instance you know starting in the spring and summer of next year that that's where we're going to go and i think smart market participants are going to be starting to look ahead and ahead to say they're going to start to look through those disinflationary impulses and start to see that we're going to have a dynamic where that may that may be reversing i think that combined with the fact that at least in the bond market we're likely to see a situation where the duration supply which is by calendar-wise quite modest in december combined with the fact that we've had a moderate we had that rebalancing support you put those two things together we could easily see pressure on the bond yield just as we saw in early 24 coming in early uh sorry in early 23 coming again in early 24 um the uh uh there's a question here about which valuations which measures were i considering when i was looking at um these particular price pressures or these valuation measures here um what we look at here is the uh relative returns of the financial assets and so you should expect over time the financial assets deliver a positive return and more volatile financial assets deliver more return and less volatile financial assets deliver less return and so what we're doing here is on a volatility matched basis looking across all the major asset classes and saying how what has their return level bin relative to a long-term trend of what we'd expect uh for those assets to return and that level of return is the is the thing that we're looking at when we're measuring what this looks like here and so it's not a pure pe ratio peg ratio or schiller or any of that stuff it's just looking at the pure returns the pure relative returns of the assets relative to their longer term norms and so that could catch either and i think that's why it's important it could cat either that earnings themselves are overstated because margins are overstated and that can certainly exist with equities andor capturing the fact that pees could be overstated as well let's just hit a couple more questions um uh i think you know i think one of these questions which i think is a just more structurally interesting question is how do you think about expressing contrarian views um you know the market certainly seems very highly convicted that there's going to be a lot of cuts uh and what i'd say is that um expressing contrarian views well first of all the only way you generate alpha is by having a contrarian view um and so by definition in order to generate differential returns your view has to be different than the market you know i don't know how many times i read something for instance just go you know go read the 24 uh you know the 24 outlooks the 2024 outlooks by many of the major sell-side firms or or buy side firms and they'll say well we really think that the fed is going to cut 150 basis points or five to six times in 2024 it's like okay so what that i already know the answer to that that's already in the market price the question is what's likely to transpire that's different from that where are the probabilities tilted different from that and when you think about that that's really what creates those contrarian opportunities which is where are the probabilities out there in the market um where the probabilities of certain outcomes are underpriced by the market and so when you're thinking about how to position for that i think the main thing to consider is not getting overweight on any particular bet any particular alpha decision uh can easily skew you know 6040 any one bet 6040 and so when you're thinking about what do you put on keep in mind that 6040 that that how good think about your goodness right which is you know tilted in your favor but by no means certain when you're putting on those bets um and so you want to remain conservative there's good ways to create risk controls you know i think many skilled investors use options because it helps contain a very clear amount of risk you you know exactly the risk that you're putting on the line um or what you can do is measure those positions in var terms or expected or possible loss terms to make sure that you're not taking extreme views i think the biggest thing the biggest thing when you're constructing a portfolio like this is to look across markets and try and find those opportunities where you can get a couple different bets on the market that are skewed in your favor often or ideally bets that are negatively correlated to each other um do you think in this cycle that markets will front run the economic cycle or will they need to see economic damage to begin to price it well i i think in many ways um you know a lot a lot of us have lived through only two uh and a lot of us are our most recent memories are two very acute cycles which is 20 and 2008 both of which were highly uh you know highly v-shaped in terms of their dynamics where um where there was an acute crisis point market sold off uh as a response to that acute crisis and then easing occurred and marcus rebound and i think in a lot of ways that got folks to thinking that first crisis happens you often hear people say first something breaks and then uh the economy and markets respond but that's not normally how macroeconomic cycles work most macroeconomic cycles are self-reinforcing which is that the tightening of monetary policy leads to a weakening of asset prices the weaking of asset prices leads to a slowing of demand that slowing of demand leads to weakening asset prices right it's a reinforcing dynamic and so what i'd expect to see through this cycle is that we're probably going to have to see some meaningful equity weakness before we start to get enough growth slowing to then start to create the recessionary dynamics to then start to create the downturn but that is going to be a reinforcing process and it will continue until the point in which there's a sufficiently large easing which can help reverse the economy and we're not going to get to that but my guess is that that's going to be tougher than most people expect and so thinking about where how will the markets play out that timing dynamic the timing dynamic will be bond yields or bonds underperform stocks outperform then stocks underperform and bonds outperform and that stock underperformance is self-reinforcing uh another question here um is do you think that there's a chance the fed will be more inclined to favor uh cuts uh in the first half rather than the second half uh so they don't appear to be picking sides i um the there's there's sort of two different things first of all like the fed responds to macroeconomic conditions if macroeconomic conditions are aligned with tightening or maintaining policy that's what they'll do if they align with easing of policy then they will ease policy if you look back through time the fed has has tightened monetary policy during election years many times they've also eased monetary policy during election years uh certainly looks like when you put that together that election years and the political calendar is not a meaningful driver of the fed's behavior through time could that be different this time you know hard to know i'm not in the heads of the fed but it would certainly be against their core organizational mandate to operate in a way that would be responsive to electoral politics and the electoral calendar if there are meaningful macroeconomic pressures either pushing them to ease or to tighten um i think i'll i'll wrap it up with this last question which is um uh often the question is basically on the ordering why does stock why do stock declines need to happen why not just look past the recession that will come and just be long equities today and the reason why that is is because um is because you have to have equity weakness in order to have and when i say equity weakness i mean company weakness both through equity prices but also through falling earnings in order to get the recession to occur and the reason why that is is because only when you have fall equity prices does demand slow and only when you have falling earnings do labor markets weaken and i think you could see that very directly smaller uh share of the economy but you could see that very directly which is when did the tech layoff start the tech layoff started when we saw tech stocks fall in 2022 substantially the stocks fell right the the response was to that to the the stocks fell the earnings fell and the response to that was to increase their layoffs now of course that was a only one small sector of the economy it only represented 2.7 million people in terms of employment it wasn't that big a deal on the macro level but i think what it highlights is the ordering which is you don't get the sort of labor market deterioration until you get the point where stocks and earnings fall and so just think about that dynamic when you're thinking about um when you're thinking think about that case study when you're thinking about how this is likely to play out at the broader macroeconomic level we've got there's a lot of work to do if we just take a step back on the overall economy we're still uh running a secularly tight labor market nominal growth remains elevated relative to what's appropriate for the fed's mandate and despite the fact that and on the margin we have experienced a meaningful easing over the course of the last uh four or five or six weeks all that aligns with a stronger economy not a weaker economy and all that is inconsistent with the significant amount of interest rate cuts that are being priced in to the short rate and the long end of the market of the bond market and so when we uh when we look out to what 2024 will probably look like my guess is is we're going to see a real disappointment when it comes to meeting those incredibly high expectations for cuts more than anything else that's probably going to be the theme in the same way for bond holders we had a the biggest theme in 2023 was the cuts that were expected particularly after svb didn't come to fruition at all so that's probably as we look out and think about the themes that are occurring uh in 2024 we'll get back together uh again in early january i'm sure there'll be lots more to discuss there
Losses Lead to Learning for Investors,2023-12-07 13:15:01+00:00,3,Pryy4rojV_8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pryy4rojV_8,"how do beginners not lose how do they cover their downside what are some simple things that you've seen that you can recommend to people just starting out and then we can move on to the markets after that well i think one of the one of the key things part of the the building of the intuition as a beginner is observing the markets and trying to understand those linkages another key thing to develop that understanding frankly is putting a little bit of money on the line um money that you're comfortable with possibly losing in order to start to develop those intuitions because there's there's nothing better than putting money on the line thinking for instance maybe you think bonds are going to sell off because oil prices just went up right and you put that bet on in the markets and you might be right or you might be wrong uh and one of the beautiful things about putting some money on the line is that it quickly enforces fast learning i mean i can even even to this day 20 years in this business remember painful market losses that i had back in 2005 when i first started trading markets right in the in the natural gas market you know that that still sticks with me today and that's really how you accelerate your learning learning now the important thing is just do it in a scale where it's not where it's used for learning but not going to create an economic hardship if you get things wrong because as an early trader i promise you you're going to get lots of things wrong that education is invaluable but it shouldn't put you into uncertain economic circumstances uh while you're doing brilliant and do you have a risk threshold that you would recommend for people you know you and i were were uh bouncing that bean bag back and forth on var and all these different things is there is there a total minimum loss that you think hey here's here's your floor don't risk more than this any any quick metrics that you can provide yeah i mean it's interesting as a as a professional investor you're constantly thinking about what's the max loss i can take and still be continue to be able to manage money and the reality is the same's true even for a small scale individual investor say you're investing $1,000 or $500 on robin hood it's the same exact uh circumstance and so you might think well hey if i want to do this over time to develop that intuition over the course of years i need to be able to put myself in a position where i'm not losing so much money on any one trade uh where i can't stick to it over the course of a couple of years and so i think that's kind of the idea like making sure that you know even in a in a bad outcome in a meaningfully bad outcome you're not losing more than 25% of your money over the course of a year is kind of how you know that's actually mostly what institutional investors target uh at least prudent ones i should say and i think it's actually a good rule of thumb for the everyday investors are getting on the field uh you know investing and and thinking about markets"
What Do Sophisticated Investor Portfolios Look Like?,2023-12-05 13:15:07+00:00,3,oJOrr8AvaO4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJOrr8AvaO4,looking at the most sophisticated institutional investors that are out there and and they have you know sufficient capital to basically invest in any assets that they want in the world and construct whatever portfolio they want right they're totally unconstrained and i think what you look at if you look at their portfolio and basically what they've got is they've got about half of their portfolio in uh a diversified you know liquid markets set of you know assets so things like stocks bonds commodities spending on the place gold things like that and they have about 50% of their assets in what sort of would be classically termed as alternatives but i think the thing that they and and amongst those alternatives they have typically about 20% of their overall portfolio in diversified alpha is probably the best way to describe it in one form or another and about 30% of their portfolio in various equity and credit like exposures like private equity venture capital private credit etc and so you think about that portfolio you basically say well if the most sophisticated investors in the world are building that portfolio because that's the most efficient portfolio to to preserve wealth over the long term how do we help get investors to that portfolio because that's a great port portfolio that's what you want and i think the the key thing to keep in mind in addition is they're not just building that portfolio but they're actually building that portfolio at a very low cost and the reason why that is it's it's it's both highly divers if ied low cost is that what they do for each one of those buckets particularly uh you know on the public side they're basically investing their you know they're internally often managing public exposures you know just buying the stocks themselves which is essentially you know very very low cost uh because they're basically internalizing it and on the private side on that on that alt side of the portfolio what they're doing is they're investing in a bunch of managers and beating them down on fees like to put it very bluntly like you know i look at uh you know some of these big sophisticated investors and you know they're not paying 2 and 20 they're paying you know 50 75 basis points in 10 like they are cutting the fee down hugely and when you look at those strategies right and you cut the fees in half or uh you know or they're a third of the fees those are totally different types of opportunities than when you pay rack rate 2 and 20 or for most people worse than 2 and 20
Central Banks Drive Demand for Gold,2023-12-04 13:15:03+00:00,3,dnCEcaz3Z80,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnCEcaz3Z80,now you mentioned in gold that you know it should be a weaker time for gold but gold is is hitting highs and there's been unseasonably strong central bank gold buying over the past year and a half i'm just wondering do you have an opinion on what's driving this i mean is it simply geopolitical tensions or there other factors potentially well i i think you know um in many ways central banks are learning the challenge of having a digital asset held by a third party right so chinese central bank the russians and other uh adversarial central banks are recognizing that uh if you hold your your bonds at custodian in a european or us custodian right they can just take all your money away and so what are these central banks doing what they're doing is they're basically choosing to hold the physical asset which they can control rather than which is you know gold is the physical asset for which they can control rather than rely on a situation where they're um where they could easily have their assets confiscated and the issue with the gold market is it just doesn't take that much like the amount of money stock out in the world or bonds you know there's tril you know 10 trillion dollars of reserve assets if central banks just took a few percent of their total assets and moved it from you know fiat or bonds into gold that creates a huge uh price pressure on the gold market and that's essentially what we're seeing is that despite the fact that interest rates have risen gold prices you know real rates have risen 300 basis points in the last 18 months but gold prices are basically at highs how can that be it's because the demand you know what do you call it a geopolitical conflict demand just just a diversification demand look central banks realize that holding the physical gold in their own vaults in their country is the safest way to protect themselves and hold reserve assets and they're moving in that direction and you know on some sort of secular basis central bank's holdings of gold are very very low you know a few percent we're not talking you know relative to where they have been in the past at you know 50% 75% you know this is it's not crazy to think that this trend will continue uh for the next few few years and and i think that's interesting because the gold rally has happened at a time when there hasn't been retail demand so imagine what get is you start to get some actually retail has been selling like et gold etfs have been declining in aum imagine you start to get the recognition that gold might be a good asset from the retail space that could really create a heck of a squeeze on the asset on a forward-looking basis
What Type of Asset is Bitcoin?,2023-12-03 13:15:02+00:00,4,oYIiOjzOUhE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYIiOjzOUhE,you know we talked to you at our last hard money conference about what you think of bitcoin and i'm paraphrasing here you basically said you haven't figured out what drives it yet and that's what's keeping you out of the market now i'm wondering has the recent news flow or price action changed your opinion since we last spoke well i think um it has changed my opinion or evolved my opinion sort of in two ways one i think the question is um are the sort of macro drivers that often get connected to bitcoin the the things that are driving it and i think there was just there was a moment there where it looked like it might be emerging to be closer to macro drivers and we talked about maybe closer to trading like gold i think the last six months or so have uh moved away from that direction and and in particular there's number of instances like for instance um with the the conflict in the middle east like where if bitcoin for instance was uh you know a hedge to geopolitical concerns you would have expected to see it trade more closely to the incremental news related to that i think what it has highlighted the the other side of it is um it sort of reinforced my view that in a lot of ways what this is is a idiosyncratic asset that is driven by whether or not there's widespread adoption and so we have had incremental news which you just mentioned about a broader set of adoption possibilities maybe is the right way to say with the etf dynamics emerging and what we've seen is we've seen you know trade the the the the grayscale bitcoin trust is traded the discounts traded consistent with etf news the actual spot market is traded with etf news and so all of that is around that um that adoption point and so i think the main question as a as an outsider let's say in the bitcoin space is really trying to get your head around what are the adoption probabilities because you know like look if 10% % of global money is put into bitcoin and out of fiat well then it would be you know then right now it looks cheap as all get out right but if the probability of success is more like a tenth of a percent well then that's a different story and so i think that's kind of that adoption question is really what's driving the market action related to it less less than the macro dynamics that are going on got it so as you look at bitcoin in a portfolio context like longer term it sounds like kind of what you want to see is if people are are touting it as as digital gold you kind of want to see it behave like gold that'll make you more comfortable that it has a place in a in a diversified portfolio that's right and i and i think and you asked the question about will institutions uh bring on on bitcoin i think um the question is more centered on what do they see it as an asset what what what do they see it as in terms of its asset profile right now it's much closer to what you'd think about with maybe like a growth a venture growth state investment right and the attributes and the volatility and the idiosyncrasy all of those are sort of aligned with that lots of institutions have venture growth allocations right it's just it's not 5% of their portfolio to a single asset or a single company it's a modest allocation across a wide range of different possibilities and i think that's basically where institutions are at
Current View of Interest Rates (end 2023),2023-12-02 13:15:02+00:00,4,XB3lUBQ5eCw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB3lUBQ5eCw,talk about uh the economy um so i'm curious to hear your current view on interest rates because we all know that real rates are one of the biggest drivers of gold returns and hopefully down the road uh bitcoin returns could you just help us understand the moving parts of the us economy that will determine if the rate path is higher for longer or if the current cuts that are priced in i think there there's cuts priced in starting in march will they come true well first of all important to recognize gold is non interest bearing money and generally uh will perform more weakly when in real interest rates and interest rates in general are elevated though you know gold is pressing new highs at a time when interest rates are you know gold was pressing new high new highs basically at a time when interest rates were very close to their peaks and so it's actually performed really really well um when it comes to the dynamics going on in the economy you know in a lot of ways we're sort of still on this path of uh the nominal growth in the economy it's still very strong relative to how the what is necessary for the fed to meet its mandate and so measured inflation has come down that's created a lot of expectations that there's going to be interest rate cuts immediately into the economy um for instance very simple which is that like six cuts are priced five to six cuts are priced into 2024 i think that's really interesting that's a really interesting dynamic because nominal growth nominal gdp growth for the third quarter was something like 8% i mean that's very very high in the us economy it's it's expected to grow in the five to six% range for the fourth quarter so you put that together we're still the economy is still too strong relative to what's necessary for the fed to durably bring inflation down to its mandate and so that likely means that we're going to continue to see elevated interest rates and that slide just basically showed like what needs to happen to get us to the point where the fed has actually brought inflation durably down to to 2% and that's a that's a dynamic that's a series of steps where first interest rates have to be elevated then stocks fall then you know basically people spend less then earnings weaken then employment weakens then wages weaken and then uh spending nominal spending comes back down to the fed's target in that process we're still very early and a lot of what's happened over the course of the last uh 30 days basically has set us back in that process by creating a financial market easing rather than forward in that process and so really it's important you know i think a lot of people are buying bonds to try and get ahead of what might be weakness in the future but important to recognize that order because the order is what's going to drive what happens which is first yields have to rise then stocks fall then that kicks off the recessionary process and so buying bonds today before you get that step those set of steps starting to work is premature and i think people will find that out as they have frankly for the last year over and over again
ETF Structures: What do they Offer?,2023-12-01 13:15:01+00:00,4,9wfVJpQaeqI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wfVJpQaeqI,i think the etf question is a particularly interesting one um because you know i came from a traditional sort of lp limited partnership structure experience and i was looking around for you know what is what is the best product for the investor and unambiguously uh etfs are the best structure for the investor u and the reason why that is is because they're essentially a tax loophole um they're liquid they're transparent and essentially a tax loop pole because what it allows you to do is it ows you under the hood of the etf from the investor's perspective you buy an etf right it's got a ticker it looks like a stock if you hold it for more than a year typically you only pay capital gains tax at the time of sale but under the hood in the etf there could be all sorts of different transactions and what the etf allows you to do is to essentially wash tax what would otherwise be short-term and long-term taxable gains uh using something called custom create redeems which basically allows uh the operator of the etf to reset the cost basis of the underlying securities in the product and what that means is that you can rebalance between assets like if you if you rebalance between stocks and bonds in your personal account and you still sell stocks when they've had a gain then you have to take a you have a taxable tax consequences yeah right you have tax consequences the beautiful thing about an etf is you can essentially do that uh in the etf wrapper without any tax consequences so maintain the value back that's kind of what the that's right got it okay that's right and so i mean look etf nerds you know we could do totally another podcast on on the nerdy aspects of the etf but the basic point is that it's a tax loop poll and it's a better structure for the investor because you have the ability to sell the asset on the secondary market whenever you want right if you very liquid it's totally liquid intraday liquid these markets particularly now like over the last five or 10 years they've really deepened you know like nasdaq a hu or nysse like something like a third of their income a third of the business of nysse is in etfs so they have huge commitments to make sure these products are sold and transacted super efficiently and they've done a lot of work to do that um and in addition actually in the etf rapper there was a bunch of regulatory uh changes that occurred uh right around covid so they people kind of didn't even pay attention to them which actually now allows you to run pretty sophisticated strategies in the etf wrapper um as long as you maintain what i'd call institutional quality risk controls which you should have anyway if you're running uh an active strategy and so actually i think what we're going to see is we're going to see a lot more active managers bringing sophisticated investment strategies in that etf wrapper uh and the great thing about it is everyone can buy it right and you can buy it you go buy an etf with $10 right that that's that's the incredible thing about it you can have $10 or10 million and you both have equal access to the same you don't have to be an accredited investor you don't have to be accredited investor you don't have to you know you don't have to have a huge account you can go on robin hood and buy these things or public.com or whatever you can go and buy them you know on your phone at whatever size is appropriate for you which i think is great you know it's totally talk about democratizing you know financial assets like that that is an incredible democratization
Where is the Impact of Fed Rate Rises?,2023-11-30 13:15:00+00:00,5,APb22qomEgk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APb22qomEgk,the fed did raise interest rates uh all the way up to like five and a half really fast and we had a lot of leverage in the system a lot of people were surprised the fact that they got this far and we haven't seen a lot rise in unemployment and we haven't seen a ton of disruptions in in the economy are you surprised that they were able to get it up this high and um you know what do you what do you make of this low unemployment rate do you think that's subject to change soon yeah i mean i i uh i was just the other day uh uh reviewing some stuff that i was saying uh back last last fall where basically i don't know if you remember when the sort of bloomberg consensus economists were 100% probability recession right i don't know any anytime the uh you can get 100% of economists to agree to anything you probably should fade that um and and and at the time i i you know i was a bit of an outlier and i said no no no we're not going to have a recession within 12 months not gonna happen and the reason why that is there's two main reasons why that is first of all i think it's important to contextualize how macro cycles work most of us have only experienced like 20 and ' 08 as downturns and those were very acute crisis experiences a typical macro cycle honestly takes forever it takes literally years and years to play out and like you know it's like we i sort of joke people want their recessions like they want their amazon packages you know order it right now get you know between 3: and 5 this afternoon you know that's what people want and it's just like not how it works because it takes a while interest rates rise and then you hold off lending and you hold off spending and then it takes some time and then eventually you have to refinance and you know like this is just a very slow moving process and so the macroeconomy honestly moves so much slower than what people actually think what the people's expectations whip around and particularly if you're on twitter and stuff like that like you know day-to-day expectations it's a boom it's a bust it's a boom it's a bust the reality is it's moving at a glacial pace so that's an important thing to just contextualize that these things typically take three to five years to play out from the beginning of a meaningful tightening cycle to the bottoming so you know we're not that far into it right we're only 18 months into something that could take easily five years to play out the second thing i'd say is the economy was basically totally restructured following the the gfc the great the the global financial crisis to reduce the sensitivity of households and businesses in particular particular on borrowing and particularly on short-end borrowing one of the big problems with the global financial crisis was that households had borrowed a lot of floater mortgages and those mortgages reset and then those resets were too high relative to their incomes and then they defaulted on their their loans and they sto paying for their houses and the rest is well-known history by restructuring the debt markets both for businesses and households to extend maturity right to only basically only you know 90 plus percent of mortgages are now long duration 30 20 or 30 years it means that when the fed raises interest rates there's actually very little effect now imagine you're sitting if you're a middle class household you're getting your wages growing now at about 5% a year and interest rates have risen from zero to five and a half right but your mortgage hasn't risen so your wage growth has risen the money that you're making in the bank account in your bank account has risen right your your like you know money market fund is risen in terms of its yield but your borrowing costs haven't changed and so actually in some ways many of those middle- class households are in some ways better off today than they were before through that dynamic of having locked in a very low mortgage cost very low borrowing cost for a long time and so the result is you're gna have the fed basically has to either get interest rates to be up high for a long time or they have to get asset prices to fall and so far at this point you know stocks are basically at all-time highs on a total return basis and house house prices are at all-time highs and that's those are the sorts of things that don't like until that changes the economy isn't meaningfully turning
Macro Investor Perspective on Generate Alpha,2023-11-29 13:15:01+00:00,4,LC8It23VFv0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC8It23VFv0,when you're sitting as a macro investor which is which what i mean by macro investor is an investor who's primarily focused on the returns of you know country level equity indices bond markets currency markets commodities etc not individual stock picking but sort of the overall index style investing what you learn uh through that process is that there are sort of fundamental cause effect drivers particularly tied to the macro economy that drive macro asset market returns and so i think one of the key things is really helpful in terms of uh in terms of my development as an as an investor is developing that sort of rich deep understanding of the macro connection so why would bon yields move up or why would they move down or stocks move up or stocks move down a lot of times at the macro level those are driven by sort of these fundamental properties of the economy which for instance whether growth is getting getting stronger than people expect or inflation is lower than people expect or monetary policy is tighter or easier than people expect those different underlying core drivers then are reflected in what goes on in macro asset pricing and so in a lot of ways i think macro markets really is a really useful lens because it allows you to connect the big thingses that are going on in the in the in the economy to to market returns that you know give opportunity for betting or we call generating alpha um over time yeah so you said that there are these like connectors and you brought up uh inflation growth monetary policy um is that how you think about investing in these different asset classes and you kind of look at their relative performance and that's how you kind of construct a portfolio is kind you start there and then move out well i think it's important to to to think about whenever you're uh investing there's basically two sources ources of investment return one is uh what we call beta which is passive investing which means if you buy stocks you stock market you would expect over time for that to have a positive return right because you know if it didn't why would you ever buy stocks why would you ever give a company your money through equity issuance and so the key things to think about for beta is what we call it is to think about how do you balance your portfolio to most effectively uh be sort of balanced to different macroeconomic environments so sometimes inflation's going to be high sometimes it's low sometimes growth is strong sometimes it's weak and how do you make sure that you don't get overweight on one particular outcome or another the other side of generating returns is something called alpha and what alpha is is basically taking bets in markets right so saying i think you know the market pricing is a certain thing for instance if you think about the fed right now the market is pricing the fed to cut four times in 2024 you can either think that that's too much or too little or just right and that view relative to what's priced into the market is what generates alpha right if you're right then you make money on that trade and if you're wrong you don't make you you lose money on that trade exactly and so you want to think about those two things differently for beta it's about balance and for alpha it's about really understanding those macro linkages and comparing them to the market pricing to see where there are opportunities where the probabilities that are priced into the into the markets are inconsistent with the probab ities in the macroeconomy
What Are Economic Expectations in the Next 12 Months?,2023-11-27 13:15:03+00:00,3,GS9yM8XRp44,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS9yM8XRp44,what should we as investors really be looking at over the next 12 to 24 months um i think the biggest thing that's going to happen over the next let's say the next year is that the macro the evolution of the macroeconomy will be a lot more boring than will be the evolution of people's expectations around the macroeconomy and that'll be really important because we'll that'll create a lot of opportunities like the macroeconomy is slowing it will probably meander slower further uh but uh as as it has been for the last 18 months give or take um but uh there will be a real obsession with calling the next turn the next turn the next turn the same thing that we've seen over the last year uh you this very fast moving shift in in expectations relative to the slow moving reality and that's the thing that's going to create a lot of opportunities i mean we've had i think four rounds of pricing out interest rate cuts uh in you know 12 months forward interest rate cuts uh over the course of the last year my guesses we will continue to see the same thing and a lot of this policy action particularly the policy action by the the treasury to limit duration supply has slowed that process down further than probably what we would have thought just a few weeks ago and so expect very whippy sentiment and very slow reality um so you stay disciplined out there uh that'll be the uh you know you you'll find a lot of opportunities in fading uh stream expectations relative to to uh uh you know very modestly moving uh uh fundamentals
U S  Labor Market is Still Tight,2023-11-22 13:15:03+00:00,4,hPeZZXV2bE8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPeZZXV2bE8,"the us economy you the labor market is tight securly tight for those of you who uh read my tweet on every every thursday um about this point um and i you know i think like we had we had an incredibly hot labor market in 2021 and early 2022 that had since cooled really modestly might call it normalized a relative to the post co boom but the the challenge with the the labor market it's challenge or not but the reality with the labor market is that given the secular demographic experience it just doesn't take that many jobs to keep the labor market you know reasonably tight uh you know we have labor force growth of course there's a lot of ambiguity about this point but you know let's call it a a million you know to a million and a half jobs let's say uh in terms of or labor force growth okay well what does that mean that means payroll employment goes up by 100,000 a month and you know lab labor markets or more than 100,000 a month and the labor markets are you know still pretty tight and so you look at that and you sort of say to yourself well i mean 100,000 jobs a month is just not that many jobs um and so when people look at these payroll reports i think a lot of people are focused on the fact that they moderated from you know 500,000 jobs to 150,000 jobs but still that's a fine situation to be in and so what that means is with labor markets continuing to be relatively tight even with moderate moderate growth um in employment that there will continue to be you know labor shortages in to some extent structural labor challenges labor hoarding and you know more higher uh wage growth than would otherwise be the case and that's essentially what we're seeing is that you know even though there's been like a bit of a softening of the labor market if you look at and and wage growth has come down from you know in the in the let's say in the 5 to s range we've now fallen into the four to five range uh depending on your measure of choice but that's still a couple percent above where it was prec covid uh and if you and that's important right because preo you know we were at essentially the fed's target when it came to inflation if we have let's say you just assume that we have the same labor productivity dynamics today as you did five years ago and you have nominal wages that are growing at you know 2% higher at a 2% faster pace because of embedded inflation experience c causing a bid for wag plus uh the tightness you know combined with the tightness of the labor market well the fed can't get back to its mandate under that circumstance"
What Does a Soft Landing Require?,2023-11-21 13:15:02+00:00,4,KlWb5I4MaFk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlWb5I4MaFk,you know is is a soft landing possible and by soft landing some people say all sorts of different things about soft landing like can inflation durably go back to the fed's target durably durably is an important word can it go durably back to the fed's target without a meaningful weakening of economic condition that's what a soft landing is and um you know i look at the set of conditions here the markets are saying essentially like c there the market the market's cross asset market pricing is certain there will be a soft lean and what i'd say is maybe i'm underconfidence but certainty on a soft landing would not be my opening bid for the probability that we get there and i think that's because there's a number of different paths that are mispriced in the financial market uh you know around relative to that perfect certainty which is you we may well have inflation be higher than what people expect like if you have strong growth that continues in tight labor markets inflation is probably going to be higher than people expect you know in 2024 and beyond so you know things like oil look from a macro perspective i'm not a bicro guy on oil or an expert by any stretch but commodities and and oil in particular look cheap relative to what's priced into grow equities you know at the same time uh so inflationary pressure to emerge at the same time and then also in that context if growth continues to be strong there's no way that the fed is going to going to cut 100 100 basis points in 2024 no way like just not how it's going to work right if growth continues to hold up they're not going to like do a green span tweak of monetary policy to bring it down so it seems like you know those two those are two places that are miss pric and then on the flip side you know it's also very possible that this doesn't work out in the sense of um in the sense that uh that you know the momentum you know we've seen some weakening momentum in the economy that could just continue much and accelerate much faster than people are expecting so you don't get the double digit earnings growth and so i think it's a hard time because you know essentially soft landing is priced in a certain way that the right portfolio of positions is taking on is is basically saying well the equity market is pricing for things to be too strong so i want to fade that but the the short rate market is pricing for things to be too weak so i want to fade that and the inflationary pressures that are priced in in the oil market inflation and growth that's priced in the oil market looks too weak so i want to fade that and so the you know like the combination of different positions are actually like they're all kind of mispriced in the 60/40 way although they're mispriced in opposite directions so you know the sort of portfolio that looks interesting today is like short stocks uh short short rate you know and maybe the twos long oil that's a that's a difficult combination to conceptualize but i think that's the uh that's that's the reality of where we stand with the markets today
Is The Recent Bond Rally Sustainable?,2023-11-20 13:15:01+00:00,4,JTv_qwJKLZQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTv_qwJKLZQ,you talked a lot about uh late cycle bond rallies before can you dive into this a bit and given you know do you see this latest rally as sustainable you know we just had the latest bfa manager survey that came out that showed investors were dumping cash and hold the biggest overweight position in bonds since 2009 so what kind of what are your thoughts on that the bond market right now well i think the biggest picture thought and i i you know when bonds hit in the ballpark of 5% i and there were some people drawing lines to 133% i said hold on a minute you gotta you got to understand the bond market at you know four and a half or five perent the composition is very different than the composition when um when it was at 2% right and and what that means is that there's a lot of yield sensitive buyers that you know emerge in in that as you start to elevate the interest rates and that's literally what we've seen is even though the deficits up yield sensitive buyers have picked up and that bank of america serv is a good example right of yield sensitive buyers shifting their positions in response to the to the price changes that have occurred uh and so that's kept a lit on things you know i think basically what we've seen is that there's been uh you know not only did we sort of get to that point but then on top of it essentially janet yellen decided to do an easing step which is you know politically advantageous probably macroeconomic stupid but politically advantageous uh and so and the reality is that she could keep doing i mean in fact you know j yell in the next q could cut uh bond is she cut coupon issue with uh you know slow slow kuban insuance meaning and still coupon you know bills would would be under 30% of the overall uh debt profile of the us and 30% isn't even all that high if you go back through all history and stuff like that it's been well above 30% and so uh in history and so look like you know could janet yell and keep lit on this bond market by continuing to ease to to limit coupon supply and duration supply and keep the lowend you know long end of the bond market contained like absolutely she could i mean certainly for any time frame that we care about as as traders the the consequence is just that if she does that the fed's going to have to do more because you know by keeping in a late cycle you know a later cycle environment expansionary environment if your response to an expansionary environment is to lower interest rates on the long end and stimulate equity strength the outcomes of that are going to be such that you're not going to achieve your mandate for inflation right growth will be too strong relatively your mandate for inflation so that's probably you know i think that's part that's certainly a plausible dynamic that we could see which is why those december 24 sers are are crazy in that context which is if you're g to have you know you're not going to have a circumstance where there's strong there's a strong economy i mean i would argue unless the economy is terribly weak the fed is not going to cut in the way that's being priced in and certainly if it's stronger than people expect uh you know e even if it's moderately good supported by all this easing all these easing steps that have occurred like there's no way the fed's turning around and cutting i mean in march fed's going to cut in march no way not g to happen
Gold and Oil. Commodity Asset Prices In Nov 2023,2023-11-19 18:03:02+00:00,3,5WIZZD6sAv8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WIZZD6sAv8,got to talk gold cuz you're a big gold fan pointing out how much if you had been holding it in your portfolio since 2020 would have reduced volatility for you but given where we are now can we count on gold continuing to have that effect over the next three years well i think the main thing to remember about gold is gold is non-interest bearing money and it's been impressive how much gold has held up in the context of long-term real interest rates rising 300 basis points now they might rise a bit further that might be a bit of a drag on gold from there but eventually you're going to have a situation where the fed is going to have to deliver easier monetary policy and holding gold in your portfolio may prove to be even better than holding treasuries because of that uh sensitivity and benefit when real rates start to fall on the backside so from a strategic asset allocation gold is really beneficial because it basically operates in a way that's very opposite to what stocks do what do you make of the impact uh of the drop in oil prices well i it's it's hard to suggest that there's been a big macroeconomic driver causing the the oil price market to move so swiftly downwards and so what it's looking like is more uh a paper selloff where i think in some ways uh people are inferring from the bond market and the yield moves that are happening in the bond market that uh that that we're having a negative growth environment and then that's translating somewhat mechanistically into the oil market uh in futures positioning and paper positioning i think the challenge with that is that the reason why we're getting to move down in the bond yields is because people are expecting easier monetary policy right which should actually be beneficial to growth over time and so i think people are looking at sort of a traditional intermarket action dynamic and not recognizing the actual fundamental cause of that bond yield move is actually supportive to oil rather than detrimental to it so you don't think oil goes down much further it sounds like no i think there's a real opportunity here in terms of from a skew perspective as we know opec plus is meeting shortly they've already taken a million barrels a day off the market if this oil selloff gets any further you have a combination of opec pulling more supply off the market plus eventually we might have the spr come back online and start filling it back up both of which basically put a floor on where you are on oil prices so i think from a skew perspective still looks good uh if you're going to buy a cheap growth asset in your portfolio uh better to buy oil than to buy stocks at these levels all right
Is a Soft Landing Possible?,2023-11-18 13:15:02+00:00,3,NPeUWfmsJqg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPeUWfmsJqg,soft landing is just the transition phase from growth to a recession and it's not the landing there is no landing in a soft landing well you you land for a little bit of the runway and then you fall off the end of the runway do you always fall off though i think this is what this is what the question i i think the point that andy's raising which i think is is an important one is um when when you're looking at markets it's not about like making good trades in markets is about having having a view relative to the consensus probabilities finding the op the situation where the probability of one outcome is higher or lower than what the consensus probability is and when we look across markets today you have you know that uh very strong earnings growth uh priced into the market analyst expectations for double digit earnings growth for the next two years you have um you know 2% inflation for forever uh you have real interest rates at 2 and a half% you have oil prices at at alltime lows like you look at that combination of things and that is essentially like the cross asset views are all in on a soft landing that we will achieve the single perfect soft landing and that is that is certainly possible soft landing is possible but the question is is the probability 100% and the answer is no and like not close to it and so i think the thing that's interesting is you go through all these different um markets in terms of what's priced in which you have to do carefully and like this this is this is the discipline in terms of creating alpha is it's not just about your overall view is there going to be recession is there not going to be recession is it going to be soft landing is it not it's where are all the different probabilities of what's likely to transpire versus what's priced in and you look at that situation you say odds are are we going to get you know 12% earnings growth in the next two years eh probably not probably lower probabilities tilted that way are we going to have inflation at 2% perfectly forever h you know could happen probably not could be higher are we going to have um the fed perfectly ease you know 75 to 100 basis points next year not too much not too little particularly when the treasury is is fixed on being an instrument of easier policy given their long-end supply no probably not the fed might have to do more to get us to the point where inflation terribly down and so you sort of put all those pieces together and some of those views are recessionary some of them are stronger than what's priced in but that's what you have to do across this market and i think to answer your question why why are we seeing the um dynamic occur across the markets where sort of everything's kind of implausible i think there's been a real reduction in cross asset investors like i think you know people aren't going through the process of arbitraging essentially the macroeconomic reality across all those different pieces because it's just not how people are investing these days and we
Should We Expect the Fed to Pivot Soon? (No),2023-11-17 13:15:03+00:00,3,rI7JTbAFmxQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI7JTbAFmxQ,bob i think that andy just laid out what happened we've but we've seen so much volatility in bonds really experienced people got head- handed to them many times as they're trying to anticipate the pivot and we've seen it again a lot of people asking are things different this time are we in for a more prolonged period of volatility are we higher for longer has the labor market changed are we in this postco world where do do the models work now as we try to figure out the trajectory that that andy just talked about how are you viewing all of that yeah i mean i think um i think andy did a nice job outlining um where we are today and i think the core of uh what's been the challenge for a lot of investors is that they haven't respected that script i i call it the order andy has a script his script is much more elaborate than my order which is fit on one tweet but like this idea that okay there will there will be a point where inflation becomes lower you know at the fed's target and in order to get there there has to be recession most people to be clear agree with that basic premise right the the issue that their uh the the early pivote keep uh confusing is that there's an order to that which is first the bond yields have to rise then the stocks go down then the economy weakens and then we get inflation back to target so if you buy bonds today while the economy is still high because you think that there will eventually be a recession that that's out of order that's not how it works or even worse all those people buying stocks today like people buying stocks today who are like the fed's going to pivot it's like okay but why would the fed pivot the fed pivots under conditions where economic activity is weak okay so first you have weakness then you have pivot right that's the order and those orders are very important to keep in mind and folks i think because um of the 40-year disinflation many people are sort of thinking at the second that we get the tiniest bit of weakness in economic conditions the fed is going to immed immediately flood the economy with with liquidity and in an environment where inflation is still from the fed's perspective elevated relative to their target that's not how it's going to work and so what we're seeing is actually a cycle um that is more akin to what we saw maybe in the late 60s that sort of dynamic going on than it is frankly anything in our professional lives
The Fed and the Treasury: What's The Story?,2023-11-16 13:15:02+00:00,4,KedCk5vIfdw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KedCk5vIfdw,fact that inflation is still not at the durably at the fed's target and it's not even it's not just that it's not there it's that it the fed at least right now doesn't see a clear and convincing path to it so that they can start to ease off the tight monetary policy that they have in place and so i think one of the things you know what we've seen obviously over the course of the last six months is a recognition that we're going to need higher rates first in order to slow the economy in order to kick off that moderating cycle to slow wage growth which should eventually slow nominal spending and then slow inflation um but you know that wage that that rise in interest rates essentially hasn't been yet enough to get there in a convincing manner and i think one of the issues was that the fed basically said uh you know as of a couple of meetings ago they were really pointing to the fact that the short rate or recognizing the short rate really wasn't the thing that was going to get the job done they really needed that long end to move up and they got some of that until of course janet yellen wrestled away the tightening that they needed through the shift in the qra composition bring bon yields down yeah we don't have a team right i mean they wrestle each other all the time of course and and what i would emphasize is from a rolls perspective if you actually go back and read about fiscal monetary policy in the 60s or in the 70s it's not this is not unusual i would say particularly in heightened inflationary environments um or in environments where there's you know uh a desire to engage in uh fiscal expansion uh and populism uh as well as you know global conflict to fund global conflict and so it's not it's not like this is a shocking move on the treasury's part but i do think it's an important move because it basically trans the treasury has been uh a technocratic institution basically for the last 30 years um and now what we're seeing is indications that it's going to be a policy-making institution rather than a technocratic implementation institution that's a big shift and you'd be surprised at how much flexibility janet yellen has actually to shift the composition of duration before running into any meaningful um meaningful sort of outliers in terms of the overall debt composition in the us right and i think we're all old enough to remember when janet yellen was the fed chair and she was banging on the table saying hey we've done all this monetary policy stuff but there's no fiscal right so now that she's in you know leading the treasury she's doing all this fiscal but it's offsetting the monetary policy stuff so you know just not everyone can they're just not on the same page at all absolutely and i think one of the things that was super interesting about the market action coming out of qra was that there's basically a bid on all bonds right but what that ended up doing is it created a bid on twos and t and that didn't make any sense because if these two levers are going to work in opposition to each other which i think you know i'd say probably over the next year we're going to see opposition between them what that should indicate is that the fed needs to be tighter than expected before the qra uh and given that the treasury is going to be essentially easier than expected before the qra but instead the exact opposite happened in the market action which was po got priced in to ease more in 24 as a function of the qa and that's the thing that i think makes no sense to be honest with you if we're in this new world po's gonna have to do more in response to the easier long end policy and so those you know 75 to 100 basis point cuts that are priced in 24 certainly look vulnerable in that context
What's Happening in the Housing Market?,2023-11-15 13:15:01+00:00,4,IAjsr02bjCU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAjsr02bjCU,bob what are you seeing in housing you know i think the most important thing on housing to recognize is that the composition of the housing market at a peak or a boom is just like totally different than at a a freeze and we're at a freeze and you know we're at like a traditional standoff you know they're you know both sides are staring each other that being the the buyers who want lower prices and the sellers who don't want to sell and they're just kind of staring at each other and usually what you need in order you usually need a c cyst in the housing market to start to create that price change and like in 0607 we had a catalyst which was there were a lot of floaters right and ios that basically reset and totally hammered people right and so that was that was the the catalyst back then in this case and if you go back in previous cycles before that the catalyst is unemployment and so the basic question is like what's the catalyst today well as long as incomes are okay and unemployment isn't deteriorating like we can just stand and look at each other and basically have no transactions and have elevated levels of prices until you get to the point where in particular i think employment starts to deteriorate and then what we're going to see is it's going to be a blood bath a fast moving blood bath where the folks who are trying to dump their house onto the market are going to have absolutely no luck so it'll be you know if you have a house to sell today's the day to do it because it tomorrow may be a lot more challenging yeah and i hear people say it's kind of airbnb is going to you know people selling airbnb residences all this sort of stuff that may or may not h not happen i just i think what you're saying is well maybe not what you're saying but one way of uh interpreting that is if we start to see mass layoffs and people have to sell their houses to get cash then we could really see prices drop pretty quickly right right and the airbnb thing just there there are a million airbnb listings in the us and like okay so what are you talking about like you know most of the people who list their house on airbnb live in their house or it's their vacation house or whatever it's not like the number of people who are buying like 12 apartments in miami you know on south beach in order to lay it out for an airbnb is pretty tiny in the scope of you know hundreds you know 100 million units that are out there in the market right it's just it's right airbnb will not be the catalyst unemployment that could be caps right yeah that's and you don't you don't even see like slowdown in hiring in construction which would tell you that maybe the housing market's getting soft i mean there's no layoffs in the construction sector yeah that's right i mean it's basically i mean part of that's the multifam there there's there's also these secular dynamics which is basically the household formation has been you know considerably elevated making us millions of units short relative to uh household form over the course of the last 15 years coming out of the financial crisis and so you know in some ways like in some ways a a few airbnb owners puking out their uh their airbnbs would actually be good because there's some young couples who would who would love to live in those apartments at a slightly lower price than they can right now y yeah well there might be a micras to actually watch because new york just banned airbnb so i'd like to see what the rental market does there in the next six months see if there's some kind of like lowering of it so
Corporate Earnings vs GDP Growth:  What Do The Numbers Signify?,2023-11-14 13:15:01+00:00,5,NdaZm0PZG5k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdaZm0PZG5k,talked about 6% earnings growth within the context of 8% nominal gdp can you help us understand why that matters well i i think the the basic question uh for the for the equity market is thinking about what's priced in and i know like at some point like sometimes i start talking about what's priced in and people are like ah that's so boring why are we talking about what's priced in but when you're trading the market you got to trade it against what's priced in that's all there is to it analysts are expecting 12 we've had you know pretty mediocre earnings growth like at the s&p 500 level you know quarterly earnings has been from a macro guys perspective you look at the numbers you well it's kind of been flat for two years basically right you know it means up a little bit this quarter kind of wiggled up and down but like basically flat i'm sitting there thinking well my god the like gdp growth nominal gdp growth has been about as good as it will like ever be in the rest of our lifetimes in the united states and earnings are totally flat you know and it's like okay well well heck what happens when things get worse you know like how how are they going to meet the that earnings growth expectation that sits in the market in the event that you know even in the good times these companies are struggling to generate this type of nominal earnings that would would get aligned with the types of expectations that are priced into the market so that's that's the gap that's the gap that i see like exp and also to be clear from that time we've had interest rates rise a few basis points we've had on the short end on the long end we've had the global economy europe and the uk slowing down like it's not like you know there's a boom out there um and uh you know and that that's likely you know that impact on us companies is likely ahead rather than behind related to those issues as well right so um you know we've talked about this before about you know the uh the margin expansion that companies had over the last two years that opportunity that window's closing you know it just seems to me that there are a lot of headwinds in terms of earnings growth going forward is that i mean is that kind of what you're seeing this you know nominal gdp you say is as good as it's going to get does it just seem like that that window's closing for those companies and we're in for some difficult quarters ahead well i think that the again from a macro perspective when you look at it like how do companies make money either the top sales have to grow really well or they have to have margin expansion and the way that you have margin expansion typically is through um uh borrowing the household in particular borrowing uh and spending or they you know really what's happening is their incomes aren't keeping up with the topline sales growth and when you look at that picture today like on a forward-looking basis it certainly looks like you've got a circumstance where um where like nominal gdp growth will be lower in the future than it has been over the last two years y for you know because we've tightened because global economy slowing etc and then you look at the margin picture and it's like well i mean the labor markets are pretty tight wage growth is a is a lagging indicator the big reason why those companies were able to get such good margin improvement during essentially like coming right out of the coid crisis is because it just takes a while to negotiate the wages up but now we're in a circumstance where you know some people say well real re real wage growth is a good thing and i think it it's a good thing for the individual spender but it's actually a terrible thing for a company like companies don't want real wage growth companies want negative real wage growth they want their prices of their goods to rise a lot faster than what they're paying their workers because that's when their margins expand so real wage growth from a um from a company perspective which is driven by the tight labor markets and the flow through of the previous inflation to wages eventually coming through that's a bad outlook so like you know i don't know from a macro perspective it's not looking good
Portfolio Allocation (Beyond the Magnificent 7),2023-11-13 13:15:00+00:00,4,BRBqJmsK850,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRBqJmsK850,look a lot of folks have been all in on the magnificent 7 in the last 10 days have certainly sparked renewed interest that that is uh that those companies will continue to radically outperform basically any other companies in the world and look seven companies can be in a bubble for longer than any of us can remain solvent and i think the real question is what is your time frame what is your time frame uh to think about how you want to allocate your capital and if you're allocating on a day or a week or a month look cha chasing bubbles may be the thing that attracts you but if you're thinking about how do i prudently allocate capital over a multi-year time frame then you start to have to meaningfully consider the discontinuity of valuations that exist uh across uh the us within the us equity market and all across the world that's really what i'm highlighting here if you go to the right hand side side the right hand chart i think it's pretty interesting to see just how much reating there has been of the s&p 500 how little reating there's been of the s&p 500 right that's what you see is basically the s&p 500 um pe today is basically next 12 months pe today is basically uh where it's been on average over the last uh 10 years now to be clear interest rates today are radically more elevated relative to where they were over the last 10 years and so it it you would not expect to have the same earnings yield you would expect to have to have a much higher earnings yield given the fact that real interest rates have gone from negative 100 basis points to positive 250 basis points right a huge 350 basis point increase in real interest rates should lead to a higher required earnings yield on your stocks but nonetheless when you look at the s&p 500 as a whole what you see is you basically see uh an unchanged ear earnings yield over the period uh for the large cap equity market but that that basically uh is the only the only place where you see those sorts of dynamics if you look across other areas of the us economy basically if you look to smaller cap companies you've had a meaningful adjustment even considering the weaker earnings growth that exists for those econom for those companies and so you look at the s&p 600 or or 400 etc um and you see that they've been meaning rated unlike the rest of uh the mega caps and then you look around the world and what you basically see is you see the weakest sentiment for non us stocks uh that you've seen in decades on the the left-hand chart what you see is the difference in the equity risk premium between the us and europe which is basically at you know 30 40y year lows meaning um meaning that you know your your us stocks are meaningfully more expensive than those in europe you're getting almost double the earnings yield in holding european and uk stocks than you are in holding us mega cap stocks and then you also see in the middle chart there where the sentiment uh on emerging market stocks is basically as weak as it's been uh since uh since the financial crisis and so you know if your time frame think about how do i construct a portfolio over a couple year time frame and you're thinking about how do i what sort of equity exposure do i want you really have to start thinking about these areas outside the us in terms of their valuation and how extreme the divergences between us mega cap tech stocks have been relative to uh how it's being priced in the rest of the world
Macroeconomic Conditions in UK and Europe (Nov 2023),2023-11-12 13:15:00+00:00,6,6Ei5-uKCJ2s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ei5-uKCJ2s,when we look across the developed countries i i also i' i'd emphasize um just taking a you know a step away from the us i i think there's a lot of interesting dynamics going on when we when we go back over the you know if we go back 12 or 18 months ago there was a lot of commonality amongst the developed world economies like basically central banks were too easy inflation pressures were emerging central banks had to catch up that wasn't really priced into into market markets that led to a rise in the short rate and long rate relative to what was priced in and that was basically a universal truth but today things are starting to meaningfully diverge interestingly at a time when the expected changes in monetary policy between these these economies is actually convergent so divergent outcomes convergent monetary policy expectations that's a very important and interesting point that's going on so let's just run through that we look at the us has some of the strongest growth and inflation that is still a bit above you know still continues to be above what the target is for for the fed and what would that point to that would point to tighter monetary policy or certainly not a quick shift to easing you look at the uk you see moderate growth or weak growth but inflation core cpi remains around 6% kind of stuck at the 6% level which is vastly too high relative to the mandate uh of the boe and then you see europe which is even different from those where you have weak growth and inflation particularly core inflation which has moderated considerably uh over the course of the last six months or so and that's what you see on the lower right hand chart is you see core inflation month over month seasonally adjusted and it matters you got to do that carefully in the european cont context and what we basically see is the last 6 months it's been running at about 2% now is that is that a little higher than the ecb would like sure but we're certainly in the ballpark when it comes to thinking of thinking about the ecb meeting its mandate and in an environment i'd emphasize where you know their target interest rates have risen considerably relative to what's going on with inflation right and so that's but when you scan across these markets and you look at what priced into 2024 what do you see you see the same expected change in monetary policy pretty much everywhere and so that's what the chart on the left-hand side shows basically what it's showing is the expected change in monetary policy the curve for each one of these major developed uh economies and what you see is the uk the us and europe are all expected to cut in the neighborhood of 75 to 100 basis points in 2024 well that's certainly is uh a pretty interesting point when you think about just how divergent the policy the macroeconomic conditions are today across those different jurisdictions i mean just think about the uk versus the us like while us economy is strong uh inflation has moderated considerably right relative to the you know relative to the fed's target there's still more work to be done but it has moderated let's compare that to the uk where sure growth has been a little a little weaker but inflation core inflation remains sticky at 6% and wage growth is at 8% like what are the odds that the uk is going to deliver the same monetary policy change as the us over the course of the next year given the relative macroeconomic conditions and probably the even bigger divergence is between the uk and europe right which helps deal with those two those two jurisdictions of course help deal with the geographic help neutralize the geographic graic circumstances uh holding both in europe what do you see there you see europe and the uk are expected to ease in the same magnitude over the course of the next year think about that interest rates real rates on the short end which is shown on the right hand side in europe currently are positive 2% and currently in the uk are almost negative 2% that is a radically different policy environment for those two jurisdictions and what you see the same expected change in the future coming from both that's totally inconsistent with the macroeconomic realities and so i think what's happening here is that every you know the market participants are kind of applying an equal lens an equal shift across the uh across the developed economies when the reality is that the inflation and growth circumstances in particular the inflation circumstances are quite different between those different economies
What's Happening In Equity Markets (Early Nov 2023),2023-11-11 13:15:04+00:00,4,zYvUUEJR6vk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYvUUEJR6vk,talk about what's going on with the equity markets on the equity market side you know the basic question is are we going to see as strong earnings growth as is currently priced in remember the expectations bottoms up analyst expectations are 12% earnings growth over the next year over 24 and 25 so let's talk about how earnings growth has actually played out remember if we go back to what's been going on here nominal gdp growth in the economy over the last year has been above 6% in the last quarter was was measured to be 8% that is a very strong nominal growth in the economy right how are earnings doing not well in comparison and i think that's an important thing to recognize that is that is the tightness in for for in many cases that reflects the fact that the corporate the corporate environment the large company environment just isn't succeeding anywhere near as strongly as the overall economy and certainly the the earnings growth that we're seeing is nothing close to what uh is being seen uh in terms of overall gdp growth and so we can see that in the chart here we've we had you know really earnings growth has been flat for the last two years now remember nominal gdp growth has been running at 6% for the last two years earnings growth has been close to flat all right given how strong given how good the environment was over the last couple of years in terms of nominal gdp growth if earnings can't deliver consistent quarter over quarter growth during a period of extraordinarily strong nominal gdp growth how the heck are they going to grow 13 or 12% each year in 24 and 25 when almost certainly growth will be weaker in the future than it is has been in the past given the tightening that's occurred in the economy and i think that's a really critical discontinuity that exists between the expectations that exist in the equity market relative to the macroeconomic realities on the ground in terms of growth so what are we're seeing you know basically earnings growth that's been flat for the s&p 500 uh and and expect it to continue to be flat and maybe start to you know the the the boom in earnings is always coming but it's coming you know six or nine months away when the re the macroeconomic reality is further tightening so we see weak earnings reported earnings we see sales beats that are basically the lowest that they've been in years and we see i think what i we see over here on the bottom right hand chart a lot of companies with negative guidance overall through the course of the earning season and i think probably actually one of the more interesting things that are going that's going on is we see a fragility in the equity market and that fragility i i i know for for those of you who traded the last 10 days and it's like it seems like stocks only go up i think under the hood it's really interesting to see how those companies who have come in with underperforming earnings how they've performed in response that's what this chart here on the upper right shows and it basically shows that the negative earning surprise companies have underperformed uh or have fallen the most of any time over the course of the last five years or so and what that really highlights is the fact that when it comes to the equity market what we have is very elevated expectations earnings that are kind of mediocre in comparison to those very elev expectations and fragility that any time that you see companies fail to reach the extreme expectations that are in the market they're falling the most you they're falling significantly relative to history and so that is the combination of dynamics that could easily set up for a meaningful disappointment in the market as we turn to 2024 and the expectations that are built in there
Monthly Macro Update November 2023,2023-11-10 14:00:18+00:00,58,T2jjtg4hqLk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2jjtg4hqLk,"[music] just like we've done for the last couple of months we're we're really uh looking to do just sort of an overview of some of the key themes that we're seeing in the market uh and uh let's get started um you know last month we we came together and we talked i started last month with the same with the same basic framework which is that um the order of the macro linkages matter and what i mean by that is that uh it's it's important to recognize the path that we're going to take from where we were say uh at the beginning of the year to eventually getting inflation durably back to target um and in that process it's important to recognize that it takes certain steps to get there because you don't want to necessarily get ahead of those steps when you're trading markets and so the first step was rates rise now we've seen some rates some some rise r in rates a moderate rise in rates um but a big important step that's taken since we last talked was that uh the qra announcement with less duration supply than expected created a circumstance where there is uh where bond yields came back down although today they went back up in the other direction which we'll touch on a little later um number two is stocks fall right so rates rise stocks fall they fall for two reasons one they fall because of the discount rate rising creating a downward pressure on stocks and two they fall on expectations that those increased interest rates lead to lower economic activity in the future therefore low lower earnings growth expectations you know right now you know we saw a bit of a decline in stocks but the big picture story is stocks are really only roughly 10% off their all-time highs and those all-time highs were relatively extreme in comparison to history then once stocks fall enough you start to kick off the cycle or the process that typically leads to recession which is the fall in stocks as well as the rise in bond yields leads to a decline in demand that decline in demand leads to lower earnings that earnings decline then leads to job market weakness that then leads to slower wage growth and finally as a result of that nominal spending slows enough rel to productive capacity to get us to a point where inflation durably declines to the fed's mandate now if we look at where we are in this cycle we were about a month ago moving really from step one to step two we had seen a relatively sizable rise in rates um but and and stocks had just started to move downwards uh but you know in many ways what we've seen from a policy perspective is a bit of a reversal on that point and so so when we scan across markets today this is what you you see today which is that the qra announcement which led to you know essentially was a proactive policy announcement by the treasury by janet yellen to reduce the type of duration supply that would have been expected given the size of the deficits in order to ease the downward pressure on long-term bonds created a decline in interest rates over the last couple of weeks as well well as an increase in stocks and so that's what you see here just a scan across all these different markets with october 31st right before the the qra announcement marked or the the composition of the debt marked and what what do we see here we see stocks are up have rebounded considerably we see bond yields have come down you know they peaked almost at five basically at five uh and we're seeing also in addition uh the two-year rate coming down which is notable because to the extent that the the treasury is essentially easier than expectations engaged in a policy decision it's notable that the two-year rate would also come down likely driven by the overall bond market demand and short covering but in a way that doesn't actually make a ton of sense given that an easier uh an incrementally easier set of policies from the treasury means that there's even more work to be done by the fed to achieve its targets and so you wouldn't really expect that but nonetheless in sympathy the two-year rate came down and then what we're seeing on the term premium side it had risen it came back a little bit but you know as of today in today's bond market action it moved back up but the big picture story here is that we're very early in this cycle right look at how well you know how things are positioned in stocks we're just off the highs bond yields have moved up and that will over time lead to a slower lead to slower economic activity and should start to to create a drag on the stock market but with stocks basically you know just off of their highs their all-time highs you know again we're still very early in this process i think one of the things that's been particularly interesting over the last couple weeks is how investers have taken the incremental news from the treasury and essentially gone even more all in on the soft landing view than they had been even before that announcement and before that they had already been uh all in on the soft landing and we see that in the cross asset market pricing where the only rational uh explanation or path forward in terms of macroeconomic conditions that would align with the market pricing that we're seeing is a perfect soft landing and let me explain that if we look at the s&p 500 and we look at expected earnings growth what do you see you see um 12% 11 to 12% earnings growth expected in the s&p 500 in 24 and again in 25 that's pretty strong considering that even a very strong us economy is only growing at something like 6% on a nominal basis you're seeing uh credit risks here shown on the lower left by the high yield credit spread basically coming in up you know very low relative to history um not at alltime tights but still relatively uh low compared to the historical norms that we've seen and then so both of those point to expectations of quite strong growth you essentially no def you know very low defaults in the high yield space very strong earnings growth that that's a picture of strong economic condition now we look at what's being priced in on the inflation side of things and we see that there's been a significant decline in oil prices um over the course of the last couple weeks and particularly if you then go further out the curve not you know years out the curve just through the december 24 pricing what you see there is a return to very low oil prices essentially a big disinflationary impulse and then finally when you look at break even inflation we're basically stuck at 2% uh and people's expectations haven't really changed from that um so when you scan through this basically strong growth low inflation and then i think the last piece which i think is quite interesting is what we see is we see a federal reserve that is still currently priced to engage in sort of goldilocks policy over the course of the next uh 12 to 15 months and what i mean by that is if we had expected the fed you know if if the market expected uh very strong growth right odds are what that would the way that would be reflected is you'd expect the fed to not to not ease into that very strong growth if anything you might expect the fed to tighten once or twice more particularly since the dot plot sort of suggested and indicated a willingness to tighten a bit more uh but instead what you see is cuts but and and the amount of cuts that you're seeing are three to four cuts in you know through the end of 2024 now the interesting thing about those cuts is if you thought that there was going to be a recessionary environment right you would expect the fed to actually to cut a lot more so basically what you're seeing here is a goldilocks path of fed policy where uh strong growth low inflation and just a moderate easing of monetary policy as the economy perfectly soft lands that's basically what's priced in the asset markets and it's important to start with this i i know it's not as exciting as uh penciling out exactly what's likely to transpire but when you're in the asset markets and you're looking at what's going on this is where you have to start you have to start with what's priced in because anytime you're making your bets you're bet relative to what's priced in all your investments are are relative to that market pricing and so a perfect even more relative to even last month an even more significant bet allin on the soft landing and when we look at the conditions and the dynamics that are going on is it possible we get a soft landing yes of course it's possible um it has been seen in history it's not an impossible outcome i think the question is more what is the probability of getting that soft landing relative to how it's priced and incrementally as we go through different asset prices what's priced in and what's probable right those are the two things not what's possible but what's probable relative to what's priced in so let's let's just take a minute to think about that so here we have you know a couple of basic uh stats here when we're thinking about what's likely to transpire over the next 15 months or so the one of the biggest issues that we have is nominal growth in the us is still too strong anywhere you slice it we look at what the numbers have looked like you know the third quarter nominal gdp print it was 8% now is nominal gdp going to grow at 8% for the next year probably not but we have seen nominal gdp growing at above six over the course of the last year all of this type of growth when you're when you're comparing it to a labor force growth that is essentially zero suggests that we're probably not we're probably growing on a nominal basis uh at a pace that's just far too strong relative to the labor force growth in the economy as well as the productive capacity in the economy which is about 1% or maybe a touch more than that so six or eight% nominal growth is still far too high far too strong relative to what's necessary to achieve that the fed's mandate and then you go on the other side and you take a look at some of the price indications and while there was some indication that measur measured prices were moderating over the course of the last couple of months recent data prints have suggested that uh that that uh is not going to be a straight line down in terms of disinflation that's what you see over here on the right the most recent core pce numbers coming in you know in that 3 to four% we've seen a couple months of core inflation cpi measures uh above expectations and in that uh in that elevated uh three four five% range and so when you're at when you're the fed and and this speaks to what chairman powell was saying earlier today you know getting to that getting durably to the 2% mandate which is what the fed's going for is not going to be a straight line and there's a real risk that um and a real recognition by the fed that measured inflation may not may not be on that straight line path and so there's still a lot of caution that exists there and for good reason seon when you still have nominal growth that's this strong when you still have price growth that's the strong it's the sort of combination of things that could very easily keep inflation elevated relative to expectations and and at its core basically the issue in the economy is that nominal wages are just growing too strong nominal wage growth continues to be at five you know somewhere around four or five percent and that is considerably stronger than what nominal wage growth was preco right and these two charts show that very very clearly on the left- hand side what you see is you see nominal wage growth through eci that's essentially you know all-in compensation growth uh across the whole economy still running you know it's moderated a little bit from five to four but it's still running around 4% in comparison to preco levels where it was running around two and then on on the right hand side what you see is the atlanta fed wage survey which um basically tracks like for likee employment by single individuals to get a good of of under um uh of under $175,000 so you get high propensity spender income indications here and what you see is yes there has been a moderation from that 6% level for high propensity spenders down to something that's closer to five but even the most recent data that came out uh yesterday indicated that uh that that's that that growth rate has moderated a little bit but it's kind of stabilized in this 5ish percent range as which you see here on this updated chart on the right and so you look at all that and you say okay that is a very different picture than what we saw prec coid pre-co we had inflation that was at the fed's mandate you know one and a half to 2% and we had wage growth that was around 2% on eci and around you know 3% on atlanta fed wage growth and instead what we seeing today around 4% on eci versus two and atlanta fed wage growth 5% growth relative to that 3% level and so that's really that's the diff right it was easy to bring inflation from you know 9% down to the 3 to 4% level but this is where it actually the rubber meets the road right this is where just supply chain issue resolution isn't going to get the job done and so when you look at this you essentially have more embedded inflationary pressures in the economy than are acceptable for the fed to meet its mandate so let's go back to this story here of what's likely to transpire in terms of the fed pricing and what do you see well you see more inflation durable inflation pressures in the economy then would be indicative or consistent with a shift to cutting as quickly as is currently priced in the other point which you know of course one of the ways in which this can get resolved and and in fact a a story a narrative i'd say that has captured a lot of attention is that maybe what we're having instead is a productivity boom which would allow us to create strong growth at the same time that we get uh declining inflation and some have pointed to the last quarter uh of productivity growth in the economy uh measured productivity growth to suggest that the productivity growth boom is here and that is uh that is nonsense and the reason why that is is is two core reasons the first is that um productivity doesn't change on a dime and maybe ai will be a huge uh productivity boom for the economy but there is essentially no way that it's creating a meaningful increase in productive output over such a short time as measured in quarter by quarter measures and instead i think mostly what we're seeing if you look on the left-hand chart um is uh a a return or a consistent uh productivity growth in the economy that's between one and one and a half percent that's basically what it's been for a long time postco it was a little softer than that during co it rose more because of cyclical dynamics going on there but basically we're sort of at this longer term trend and probably even more importantly this most recent spike up the question is what drove that and i actually think in the right hand chart what you see is a big driver of that increased productivity is the fact that hours worked have been cut considerably and so what you see on the red line is the total amount of employment and on the blue bar is the total number of hours work so just think about it like number of workers times the number of hours that they worked right in order to get you know in order to get the overall output and what we see here is that the strong productivity numbers that we're seeing are a function of the fact that hours worked haven't been keeping up with total jobs that are being created and so by definition that must lead to higher productivity but that is bad productivity that is cyclical improvements in productivity in the economy that isn't new era productivity and that's really what it comes down to one of the core questions that exists in terms of this overall pth is can you get a significant moderation of inflation in an environment where uh we don't have a significant weakening of the labor markets and what this shows is maybe it's possible we're getting an increase in productivity relative to wage growth but what this would imply is that that's happening because there's been a big there's been a weakening of the labor market now i think there's some statistical noise in this i don't think it's the real story uh i don't think that's the real story i think employment is basically fine to secularly type for those of you who follow me on a on a monthly basis or on a weekly basis with my tweets on that um in general it's not like we're having a disinflationary productivity boom when you look at the data and the reality is you know employment contin continues to be fine right uh even today writing uh a tweet that said you know uh the us labor market remained secularly tight and all indications are that that's the case you know a lot of folks have started you know calling up the assam rule in order to suggest that we're right on the cusp of immediate recession but when you look at a totality of labor market indicators so not just the unemployment rate but look at claims look at job layoff announcements uh look at the employment report look at the household survey what are we seeing we're seeing in general quite a a continuation of a tight labor market and an important reason why that is is because actual labor force growth in the economy remains relatively low because of the secular demographic shifts and the somewhat limited uh amount of immigration we experienced in the us relative to uh preco periods and so you put that together it just doesn't take that many jobs on a monthly basis to keep the labor markets tight enough to keep that wage inflation pressure still in place and so that's basically what we're seeing is we're seeing a continued tight enough labor market not just create a boom in wages but to create a settling of wages at levels that are above what is appropriate given the fed's mandate to meet on inflation we're also seeing you know if you look at the if you look at the the corporate picture so so that sort of all you put that whole picture together it looks like inflation is likely to not you know move straight to 2% uh durably to 2% as is expected by many in the markets now let's talk about what's going on with the equity markets on the equity market side you know the basic question is are we going to see a strong earnings growth as is currently priced in remember the expectations bottoms up analyst expectations are 12% earnings growth over the next year over 24 and 25 so let's talk about how earnings growth has actually played out remember if we go back to what's been going on here nominal gdp growth in the economy over the last year has been above 6% in the last quarter was was measured to be eight %. that is a very strong nominal growth in the economy right how are earnings doing not well in comparison and i think that's an important thing to recognize that is that is the tightness in for for in many cases that reflects the fact that the corporate the corporate environment the large company environment just isn't succeeding anywhere near as strongly as the overall economy and certainly the earnings growth that we're seeing is is nothing close to what uh is being seen uh in terms of overall gdp growth and so we can see that in the chart here we've we had you know really earnings growth has been flat for the last two years now remember nominal gdp growth has been running at 6% for the last two years earnings growth has been close to flat all right given how strong given how good the environment was over the last couple of years in terms of nominal gdp growth if earnings can't deliver consistent quarter over quarter growth during a period of extraordinarily strong nominal gdp growth how the heck are they going to grow 133 or 12% each year in 24 and 25 when almost certainly growth will be weaker in the future than it is has been in the past given the tightening that's occurred in the economy and i think that's a really critical discontinuity that exists between the expectations that exist in the equity market relative to the macroeconomic reality ities on the ground in terms of growth so what are we're seeing you know basically earnings growth that's been flat for the s&p 500 uh and and expect it to continue to be flat and maybe start to you know the the the boom in earnings is always coming but it's coming you know six or nine months away when the real the macroeconomic reality is further tightening so we see weak earnings reported earnings we see sales beats that are basically the lowest that they've been in years and we see i think think what i we see over here on the bottom right hand chart a lot of companies with negative guidance overall through the course of the earning season and i think probably actually one of the more interesting things that are going that's going on is we see a fragility in the equity market and that fragility i i i know for for those of you who traded the last 10 days and it's like it seems like stocks only go up i think under the hood it's really interesting to see how those companies who have come in with underperforming earnings how they've performed form med in response that's what this chart here on the upper right shows and it basically shows that the negative earning surprise companies have underperformed uh or have fallen the most of any time over the course of the last five years or so and what that really highlights is the fact that when it comes to the equity market what we have is very elevated expectations earnings that are kind of mediocre in comparison to those very elevated expectations and fragility that any time that you see companies fail to reach the extreme expectations that are in the market they're falling the most that you they're falling significantly relative to history and so that is the combination of dynamics that could easily set up for a meaningful disappointment in the market as we turn to 2024 and the expectations that are built in there when we look across the developed countries i i also i i'd emphasize um just taking a you know a step away from the us i i think there's a lot of interesting dynamics going on when we when we go back over the you know if we go back 12 or 18 months ago there was a lot of commonality amongst the developed world economies like basically central banks were too easy inflation pressures were emerging central banks had to catch up that wasn't really priced into into markets that led to a rise in the short rate and long rate relative to what was priced in and that was basically a universal truth but today things are starting to meaningfully diverge interestingly at a time when the expected changes in monetary policy between these these economies is actually convergent so divergent outcomes convergent monetary policy expectations that's a very important and interesting point that's going on so let's just run through that we look at the us has some of the strongest growth and inflation that is still a bit above you know still continues to be above what the target is for for the fed and what would that point to that would point to tighter monetary policy or certainly not a quick shift to easing you look at the uk you see moderate growth or weak growth but inflation core cpi remains around 6% kind of stuck at the 6% level which is vastly too high relative to the mandate uh of the boe and then you see europe which is even different from those where you have weak growth and inflation particularly core inflation which has moderated considerably uh over the course of the last six months or so and that's what you see on the lower right hand chart is you see core inflation month over month seasonally adjusted and it matters you got to do that carefully in the european context and what we basically see is the last 6 months it's been running at about 0.2% now now is that is that a little higher than the ecb would like sure but we're certainly in the ballpark when it comes to thinking of thinking about the ecb meeting its mandate and in an environment i'd emphasize where you know their target interest rates have risen considerably relative to what's going on with inflation right and so that's but when you scan across these markets and you look at what's priced into 2024 what do you see you see the same expected change in monetary policy pretty much everywhere and so that's what the chart on the lehand side shows basically what it's showing is the expected change in monetary policy the curve for each one of these major developed uh economies and what you see is the uk the us and europe are all expected to cut in the neighborhood of 75 to 100 basis points in 2024 well that certainly is uh a pretty interesting point when you think about just how diver the policy the macroeconomic conditions are today across those different jurisdictions i mean just think about the uk versus the us like while us economy is strong uh inflation has moderated considerably right relative to the you know relative to the fed's target there's still more work to be done but it has moderated let's compare that to the uk where sure growth has been a little little weaker but inflation core inflation remains sticky at 6% and wage growth is at 8% like what are the odds that the uk is going to deliver the same monetary policy change as the us over the course of the next year given the relative macroeconomic conditions and probably the even bigger divergence is between the uk and europe right which helps deal with those two those two jurisdictions of course help deal with the geographic help neutralize the geographic circumstances uh holding both in europe what do you see there you see europe europe and the uk are expected to ease in the same magnitude over the course of the next year think about that interest rates real rates on the short end which is shown on the right hand side in europe currently are positive 2% and currently in the uk are almost negative -2% that is a radically different policy environment for those two jurisdictions and what you see is the same expected change in the future coming from both that's totally inconsistent with the macroeconomic realities and so i think what's happening here is that every you know the market participants are kind of applying an equal lens an equal shift across the uh across the developed economies when the reality is that the inflation and growth circumstances in particular the inflation circumstances are quite different between those different economies i i i wanted to touch on japan because you know we haven't we haven't really talked about japan in many of these conversations over the past couple of months um and it doesn't really fit the us context europe or or or the uk it's it's a bit of an outlier on its own and what we see in the japanese context is something you know which is basically an economy that doesn't have an inflation problem and is run is running very easy monetary policy and doesn't really have an inflation problem and so i think that's important to to recognize that many folks many many folks um were pitching the basic idea that japan is the next developed economy to meaningfully shift their monetary policy towards tighter conditions and look at the reality there on the leftand side we have uh essentially a core cpi measure for japan and what are we seeing we're seeing it run at about 2% over the course of the last three or four months indicative of the fact that core inflation pressures have really moderated in japan and i'd emphasize that's during a period where the currency has fallen considerably which should on the surface create quite a considerable inflationary impulse into the economy in fact headline inflation over the course of the last six months basically lines up solely with the inflationary pressure from the currency translation effect from imported goods what that means is that there is no inflation problem in japan wage growth is at under 2% inflation once you take out the currency effect is essentially zero infl japan does not have an inflation problem despite the fact that it's running incredibly easy monetary policy and what that means is that while the bank of japan is moving towards a more flexible regime where they can adjust the interest rate as they see fit japan is not going to be an environment where there's going to be a rapid monetary ty tiing relative to expectations and so what we're seeing in that circumstance i think on two important dynamics one we continue to see pressure on the exchange rate particularly against those developed world economies that have a tightening bias like the us and two we see actually a very interesting set of conditions that are bullish japanese companies uh those companies are continue to price in very very weak earnings growth at a time when their balance sheets are incredibly strong which is what you see there on the bottom right hand chart and where the continued easy monetary policy is going to be meaningfully beneficial for those economies for those companies both domestically and globally as many of them operate globally for for a considerable time to come and so the japanese stock market is totally different totally different from the us stock market uh in terms of the composition of dynamics whether it comes to monetary policy competitiveness or exchange rate dynamics and so that's likely to create a very compelling and interesting environment for japanese companies uh over the course of the next year or so and and just taking a step back you know i think a lot of us look a lot of folks have been all in on the magnificent 7 in the last 10 days have certainly re sparked renewed interest that that is uh that those companies will continue to r outperform basically any other companies in the world and look seven companies can be in a bubble for longer than any of us can remain solvent and i think the real question is what is your time frame what is your time frame uh to think about how you want to allocate your capital and if you're allocating on a day or a week or a month look cha chasing bubbles may be the thing that attracts you but if you're thinking about how do i prudently allocate capital over a multi-year time frame then you start to have to meaningfully consider the discontinuity of valuations that exist uh across uh the us within the us equity market and across the world that's really what i'm highlighting here if you go to the rightand side the right hand chart i think it's pretty interesting to see just how much reating there has been of the s&p 500 how little reating there's been of the s&p 500 right that's what you see is basically the s&p 500 uh um pe today is basically next 12 months pe today is basically uh where it's been on average over the last uh 10 years now to be clear interest rates today are radically more elevated relative to where they were over the last 10 years and so it it you would not expect to have the same earnings yield you would expect to have to have a much higher earnings yield given the fact that real interest rates have gone from negative 100 basis points to positive 250 basis points right a huge 30 50 basis point increase in real interest rates should lead to a higher required earnings yield on your stocks but nonetheless when you look at the s&p 500 as a whole what you see is you basically see uh an unchanged earnings yield over the period uh for the large cap equity market but that that basically uh is the only the only place where you see those sorts of dynamics if you look across other areas of the us economy basically if you look to smaller cap companies you've had a meaningful adjustment even considering the weaker earnings growth that exists for those econom for those companies and so you look at the s&p 600 or or 400 etc um and you see that they've been meaningfully rated unlike the rest of uh the mega caps and then you look around the world and what you basically see is you see the weakest sentiment for non us stocks uh that you've seen in decades on the the left-hand chart what you see is the difference in the equity risk premium between the us and europe which is basically at you know 30 40-year lows meaning um meaning that you know your your us stocks are meaningfully more expensive than those in europe you're getting almost double the earnings yield in holding european and uk stocks than you are in holding us mega cap stocks and then you also see in the middle chart there where the sentiment uh on emerging market stocks is basically as weak as it's been uh since uh since the financial crisis and so you know if your time frame think about how do i construct a portfolio over a couple year time frame and you're thinking about how do i what sort of equity exposure do i want you really have to start thinking about these areas outside the us in terms of their valuation and how extreme the divergences between us mega cap tech stocks have been relative to uh how it's being priced in the rest of the world with that uh we'll i'll pause for just a minute we have uh we have a few minutes here uh to go over audience questions i know a bunch of you folks have uh submitted questions in advance and so i'm going to try to take a look at some of those uh to start but if folks have other questions definitely plop them into the um into the question and answer if you just write them into the question and answer section i can uh i can start to go through them uh here we go we will pause here um the first question uh that we've got here is sorry this is uh' got i'm gon i'm gonna stop this i'm gonna come over here i'm gonna pull up some charts to look at this is uh so right here is uh master webinar uh work uh here so first question is could you um discuss uh or respond to a a recent uh uh memo by howard marks uh about the attractiveness of credit instruments of holding longer term credit and for those of you who are unfamiliar with the piece well first of all you should just howard marks has great uh great insights that he writes on a regular basis and definitely worth a regular read uh for investors so so definitely check out those letter i've been reading them for 20 years so i mean it's it's really um they're really good pieces i think his basic point just to over to simplify his point is that look you can buy high yield bonds and those are going to give you yields that are in the eight or nine% range that is close to an long-term equity style risk that you're taking and you know much higher up in the capital structure today than where you were before and so i think the basic question is it are high yield bonds at 8 to n% really a good deal and i think the way to answer that question is to really break it into its pieces um because uh it's not just about the overall yield that you're receiving on those bonds it's about how you get to that yield and what elements of those of that yield are actually attractive uh and showing long-term value versus what elements of the yield are not and so that's where i start here just what is a high yield bond it's basically three pieces it's credit risk it's break even inflation and it's real yields and so if we just look at those three pieces what do you see what you see here is you see an environment where uh long-term real yields are basically as attractive as they've been in many decades uh long-term real interest rates offering yields in the 2 and a half% range here i'm showing a 10-year yield is about as good as you've seen uh you know through history uh pri even prior to the financial crisis and really the only times that we've seen uh those yields even higher than that in a more recent period were periods right in the financial crisis where there were some liquidity issues in these bonds and so when i look at that set of conditions i i say to myself you know particularly if you think more structurally about the us economy and some of the secular challenges that the us economy has in place the fact that you're receiving real yield real return that is on par with uh you know 20 years ago is a pretty compelling buy particularly if you're going to hold it for a fewe time frame okay so we've got that piece that piece looks good let's turn our attention to break even inflation break even inflation is currently priced to be basically 2% now is that a good deal or is that a bad deal you know it could come in at 2% uh and um and that would be consistent with the fed meeting its mandate relatively um you know relatively well but it easily could be above 2% we could be for reasons we've talked about in these webinars before um we could be entering a period of more elevated inflation relative to what we've seen over the past couple of decades and so therefore that suggests to me at least that um break even inflation at 2% is kind of the best case scenario not the worst case scenario which is very different from the real yield and then let's look at uh let's look at at at credit spreads high yield credit spreads which are you know roughly 4% today which is on par with the boom times that we've seen in the past now do i think that there's going to be an immediate wave of defaults instantaneously no but do i think when you scan across the world and you say is this an incredible deal to buy high yield bonds currently priced you know currently structured um at yields that are sort of at this level i say to myself h it's not that compelling a buy here now when you think about that package you put that together you basically have some of the best or most attractive real yields that you've seen in a long time break even inflation that is um certainly not offering significant compensation relative to the risks that exist and the credit spread component which is you know not that great all things considered you put that together and sure when you compare high yield bonds to equities right equities being essentially the most overpriced asset in the market today yeah it's true high yield bonds look better than equities from a longer term investment perspective but the reality is what you're actually doing what you actually see is that there's real value in the real yields that's where the real value exists not really in the other elements of the security all right uh another question which has come up which i'll jump jump on here um and hopefully folks uh hopefully folks can stick around a little bit after um uh the uh the top of the hour i i'll keep i'll keep answering the questions people can uh stick around if they want to thank you everyone for for coming i wanted to come to this question this question was basically uh share some thoughts on the near and medium-term trajectory for the bills coupon mix and i think um that drew me to wanting to show i think this is a this is a very interesting chart here which i think um we we've entered you know for for decades basically the treasury was uh was not an a an instrument uh in terms of policy what they were was a technocratic implementer of the uh debt management uh of the government and so that they were not meaningfully shifting the way in which they were operating their uh debt construction depending on what was going on with market conditions i think the q announcement uh that happened a couple of weeks ago really signals a shift in terms of the policymaking influence that the treasury holds where they are going to be responsive to uh macroeconomic conditions and also uh responsive to political circumstances in terms of how they execute their policy i i said on on macro sunday which good podcast uh from andreas that you guys should should listen to on a regular basis he asked me what did i think the qra was going to be and i said i'm not really sure i think i'm much more interested in whether the q and the treasury is showing themselves as a policy maker or showing themselves as a technocratic institution i think we really got good indication of that and what i'd also emphasize is they actually have a lot of room a lot of room to continue to shorten the duration of debt before uh they run into a problem and i think this chart is a really good one which shows the amount of you know the share uh of the market that is bills in the market uh through time which is average about 22.4% we've seen that sharp rise that came um as a function of refilling the tga and now this sort of gives you the range of what could be the poss possible share of bills relative to bonds or or coupons in the market and what do you see is you basically see a circumstance where even if uh you know if the treasury basically kept coupon issuance flat the rise in bills while it would be uh meaningful in terms of limiting duration supply in the market certainly would not be uh extreme relative to the past circumstances that we've seen and this is assuming coupon duration is flat now imagine you could even cut back on coupon supply if there was concerns about what was going on in the duration market in the long-term interest rate market and still you would you wouldn't necessarily get to a mix an overall debt composition mix that would be particularly concerning relative to history and so what i'd emphasize is there is a ton of policy room that exists in the qra uh by the treasury over the next couple of quarters and that um given the range of policy flexibility that they have they have a significant ability to drive how long-term interest rates play out and what's likely uh what's likely to transpire in terms of interest rates coming in to the election period and so i think in a lot of ways rather than necessarily predict exactly what they're going to do i think you know we saw in this most recent qa um you can wait till the announcement and be responsive to it but this is going to be the story given the range of uncertainty and flexibility that they have over the course of the next couple weeks again thank you everyone for for uh for being here i'm gonna i'm going to go a little bit over the top of the hour try and answer a few more questions so um if you have drop off i appreciate that you've uh that you've come to join us but uh might as well keep going uh here in terms of um the questions we got another question here uh actually a question about tips which is great love talking about tips um used to be totally uncooled no one had talked about tips until recently the basic question of which is you know what do you think how do you think tips will trade during a period of inflation being uh elevated relative to expectations um and in particular highlighting the fact that tips have not done well over the course of the last couple uh really the last 18 uh months or so as inflation pressures were elevated and i i think it's important to recognize uh what drives tips as an asset tips are a bit different than what people necessarily might think tips are really two things they're a real interest rate bond and they're an inf inflation accumulation bond right those two things are two different assets that have different properties the inflation accumulation bond right basically is whatever inflation is you get paid on your bond and it gets paid out when inflation accumulates and so uh that essentially is a very slow in a high inflationary environments that's a very slow moving uh instrument in terms of getting a positive return on your inflation a real interest rate bond which is the other side of a tip right basically changes consider can often change considerably when there is elevated inflation in central banks tighten meaningfully relative to expectations in order to create uh in order to um in order to fight the inflation pressures that they see and so what you see there is you basically see when inflation pressures rise particularly during the acute uh early point of an inflation rise what you see is you see that those inflation pressures rise real interest rates rise and that causes a selloff in those bonds uh and so i think it's important to recognize that you know in some ways tips trade counterintuitively because of that real rate aspect and the the central bank's responsiveness to it but over time tips pay you the inflation and the real yield that exists in the bond and that's why when i look at the market and i see real yields as elevated as they are today relative to the long-term secular dynamics in the us i think they're quite an attractive asset to be holding if you want more information about this actually have a youtube primer on tips it's amazingly actually it's the number one video that isn't one of these macro outlooks on the youtube channel so anyway just definitely check that out if you're interested let's go to i think we mostly have covered the rest of these preemptive ones i think the only other question uh that i just wanted to quickly touch on one of the questions um i think there's been really interesting in the course of the last 10 days i guess basic basically up until about one o'clock this afternoon you had seen a meaningful rally in bonds and one of the questions or one of the discussions out there uh in the conversation is are we seeing a set of you know are those bonds rallying because there's weaker economic conditions or is there something else going on is it connected to the limit limiting of the duration supply and i think that uh it's a very interesting question an important question um and and really the way i would think about that question is stocks give you some insight into whether you're seeing an easing of monetary conditions or whether you're seeing an easing of growth conditions and so what have we seen over that same time frame stocks have rallied a ton typically if you saw a meaningful easing occur by the central bank what you'd see is you'd see stocks and bonds both rally in this case it happened to be from the treasury not the central bank and so what that tells us is that what's happening in the market is not a dynamic where it's weaker growth is causing bond yields to fall right because typically what would happen in that circumstance is you'd see equities fall in addition to bals falling it's the it's it's not that dynamic at all it's an easing dynamic and that's really the the the point that i think is is important to keep in mind which is in order to continue to see the market action that we saw over the course of the last 10 days up until about one o'clock this afternoon you have to see continued expectations of monetary easing of real yield or or long-end easing in order to continue to get the equity strength that we were seeing and i think today was a good example where just the inkling that the central bank would pull back created that shift in bond yields and what happened almost directly is that decline in stocks that happened with it right which is reflected of the fact that those policy implications are the primary drivers that we're seeing all right let's run through some quick other questions that are out there uh i just touched on uh the uh today's movement in the treasury market um so thank you for that question [music] um let's just scan through here we talked about the howard marks uh se change memos and and the pieces related to that for those of you who didn't catch that definitely go back um is cash attractive in the shortterm relative to other assets i think it's a good question question um i i think you know when when we talk about what's going on in terms of all price all in the asset markets are all in on the soft landing i think when you look at that that basically suggests uh that bond yields will have to be higher in order to accomplish the fed's mandate and that stocks will have to be lower and so if you're holding a 6040 portfolio cash certainly looks attractive in that context um and i think you know from a tactical perspective that you know that's basically what has to happen and and if you think about it more structurally what what does the fed do the fed has the toolkit to change uh the value of cash relative to the value of assets in order to either increase or decrease uh the demand that exists um you know consumer demand and and demand overall in the economy and if you go back to what's going on with inflation in the economy and nominal growth in the economy being too strong relative to the fed's mandate basically their path to success uh to bring inflation down to the fed's mandate is to slow demand and the way that they need to do that is by lowering asset prices relative to cash in the economy and so while in general you want to be holding assets relative to cash uh because assets over time will outperform cash cash tactically what we're seeing is we're seeing an environment that continues to set up for more pain around assets relative to cash until the point that the fed can clearly see that they're going to be able to meet durably meet their inflation mandate that's really the dynamic that's going on right now and so we're not there yet and the set of conditions that are in the market are not there yet and therefore continues to make sense uh particularly for 6040 investor to hold more cash relative to assets that are out there um we've got uh let me see here we talked a little bit about japan uh already sorry just going through the questions um i think this question this this is a good question uh here uh from anonymous attendee um which is what do you make of the argument the fed won't necessarily need to hike much more as real rates will increase with inflation moderating i i think when you think about what's going on when you think about how um how do people absorb interest rates in an economy i think you know a lot of sort of the disconnected academic view is they're they're thinking about real rates in this sort of precise way but um in terms of cpi relative to the short rate in terms of how the everyday uh consumer feels about what's going on with the level of short rates really what are they looking at they're looking at their their wages their wage growth relative to the interest rates that they're paying and they're basically saying is that a good deal for me or is it not when i'm going out and thinking about buying a car or a house or something like that and so when you think about that and what i'd emphasize is when they're thinking about that what they're also thinking about is they're not thinking about necessarily what's going on with the literal short rate because most of the time most of the borrowing in the economy is on the long end and so if you think about what's happening there for the everyday investor what they really need to have happen in order to slow their demand is they need to see a rise in those longer term borrowing rates in order to change their behavior uh or a rise in those longer term rates in order to bring down um to bring down asset prices to kick off that cycle that we talked about at the opening and so when i look at that dynamic compared to what's going on with uh the sort of classic idea of short rate versus cpi the short rate versus cpi is a pretty irrelevant measure when it comes to what's going on uh with uh the overall tightening of uh dynamics in the economy it's not really what people are looking at and if anything we might see counterintuitive dynamics there with where um where you could have cpi fall particularly in relation to income levels which creates higher real income which creates higher real demand right and so if anything my thought would be moderating inflation uh could easily without a a coincident or commensurate um rise in or decline in either asset prices or incomes is actually marginally still stimulative not margin marginally contractionary um uh views on um i think you know that's pretty much we've hit a lot of these different points i think uh i think you know i think we've hit most of these points and we're 12 minutes over the b top of the hour and um i appreciate so many of you having stuck around for the totality of this conversation um it's been honestly one of the more uh the probably the most fun uh macro webinar i've been able to do so far hopefully you all uh found it beneficial thank you so much for taking the time uh and definitely come back and uh check out subsequent months"
Recession vs. Deleveraging,2023-11-09 13:15:01+00:00,4,8y7kzsUZDIQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y7kzsUZDIQ,most people up until that point had lived through uh a number of business cycles in their career you know typical expansions which are meant by fed tightening which then create reversals in uh in the the econ in the economy which lead to you know eventual know stimulation and reflation and at that time um you know it's kind of hard to believe but when you were standing in 2007 or 2008 i think there real questions about are we seeing a recession or are we seeing something different than a recession and i think part of the key focus uh that we had at the time was building out that understanding and frankly helping educate others on being able to differentiate uh a traditional business cycle which can be reversed where the economy can be reversed using monetary stimulation typical you know interest rate cuts etc from something that was actually going on which was a deleveraging environment which is where people had and in particular us households had borrowed too much money relative to their incomes which created a need to cut their borrowing which created a cut in spending which then created the the bigger second and third order problems which is it created force liquidation of assets and that downward forced disinflation or deflationary spiral of very quickly and abruptly paying down debt and the dynamic of how to solve those th that sort of cycle you're going to cut interest rates to zero that kind of looks like a traditional business cycle but typically cuts to zero aren't good enough to actually reverse that process you have to do more in terms of monetary stimulation and so that you know whether it's you know back in the 30s devaluing the dollar relative to gold or whether it was more recently printing money uh and buying assets in order to reflate the economy we we knew that that was the path that had that the you know that that we had to go down i think another important dynamic was uh that the much of the market didn't fully appreciate the stress that that sort of deleveraging dynamic puts on the financial institutions and in particular the banks and so we were very forward looking in saying you had to be out there recapitalizing the bank banks um and in fact i can i can remember directly counseling uh the government on crafting the tarp legislation to allow for bank equity to be included as part of that rather than just traditional asset purchases and that was really critical because the beautiful thing about recapitalizing banks is banks are levered entities and so you get a lot more bang for your buck in terms of offsetting the leveraging pressure if you can capitalize banking institutions and so all of that was were things that had existed in the 1930s but people hadn't really appreciated thought we were in a traditional recession and kind of missed that dynamic and so it was really critical to understand we were in a deleveraging not a recession and the tools to meet that deleveraging were very different and and frankly uh the tools that ultimately were used by the fed uh and the treasury and and congress to help create the reversal in the economy which you know all things considered was pretty fast uh you know the the economy kind of went down in september meaningfully and by march we had bottomed and started the reflationary process and so you know that was a that was a pretty pretty good response all things considered relative to certainly relative to how the leveraging in the past had handled
Thinking In Bets Vs. *Consensus*,2023-11-08 13:30:32+00:00,3,wMUnZ8Pbitc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMUnZ8Pbitc,talk about hedge funds so when we're talking about a macro hedge fund i i sort of understand the concept that we're we're understanding how the world works we're finding these patterns these linkages we are maybe trading or investing in in maybe a hundred different markets or asset classes on various bets could we say bets um you can definitely say bets bets is okay sure sure and and and and many times it's important uh bets is actually a great way to describe it and the reason why it's a great way to describe it is because you always want to be thinking about you have a bet you have an expected you know payoff if you win if you're right you have expected payoff if you lose and it also emphasizes the fact that there is uncertainty right and so you really do have to think about uh think about any trade that you do as a bet in one direction or so like the even if you're pretty certain you know there's a chance that cleveland browns might make the playoffs next year like there's a there's a probab you know there's a probability that that could happen and when you trade markets what you do is uh it's not just about knowing the probability uh that the browns will make it um which is probably zero um it's also relative to what's priced in so it's not just whether you understand it it's whether you understand it relative to the collective wisdom of everyone in the world who is also thinking about that question and essentially pricing right and you know that you might know that browns fans are are betting with their heart not with their head and so you're saying this is a market mispricing of this probability so then how so i i kind of get that and so you're you're looking for alpha by saying such and such is mispriced or the market or the aggregate not really calculating the odds here or pricing them in or there's a way to play this trade so then what does that look like in practical it is that is that buying derivatives futures options like how how does that trade actually get executed like in financial terms yeah i mean a lot of there's a lot of different security styles that uh that investors can use in order to express that view you know people will uh regularly trade things like futures or swaps um options are often popular for certain traders in terms of you know how they construct their views of the world um or you know buying and selling or shorting cash security so pretty much that's that's the beautiful thing in when you think about a hedge fund one of the one of the great things that they have in their at their disposal is the ability to work across a wide range of different assets uh and also to to work across uh long and short positions and to uh express that in a variety of different you know forms or or structures
What is Compelling About Macro Investing?,2023-11-07 13:15:00+00:00,3,BJPLgNUOUlE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJPLgNUOUlE,what is it about alternative strategies that you find so you know compelling or so interesting or or such an intellectual riddle yeah i i find that um at at its core you know what um what folks who are often pursuing these alternative strategies and i'd say in particular in macro is this this understanding of how the whole system works um and it's and it's not you know it's not surprising i from a pure sciences background which is really focused on um you know focused on how do you understand the totality of you know a a biological system you could think about markets and economies as just a different type of system and one that i think you know frankly is pretty neat because we operate inside it so we're both actors within it and can understand our own behaviors as well as abilities to step back and see how the whole system works um and so that's really you know that's what i think is really interesting about uh about understanding the macroeconomy and developing investment strategies and a lot of ways what investment strategies are are ways in which uh you can express your understanding relative to how the rest of the the market understands the world because that's essentially what's priced in and if you get it right you've demonstrated that you have incrementally more understanding and if you get it wrong uh you know you demonstrate that you have uh an imperfect understanding what's likely to transpire and that shows the seeds of new learning right the the best thing about uh about investing in a macro sense is um there's an incredible amount to learn so you know given that you're you know at best write 55 45 at any month that means that you're wrong 45% of the time which means you have the opportunity to learn something new 45% of the time which means that frankly this is you know this is uh this is is something that is uh continues to be enriching continues to be challenging right every day uh there's a ton more to learn uh about the macroeconomy and so in many ways from like a career perspective you know it it's very enriching because you can you could basically constantly be learning there's a reason why you know many of the most famous macro folks that uh that are around they're still investing into their 70s and 80s because there's still more to learn to understand uh and and i certainly have seen that in a 20-year career and almost certainly will see that uh through the rest of my career
What Is Macro Investing?,2023-11-06 13:15:04+00:00,3,pKkT6-i9g9w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKkT6-i9g9w,so um i think the federal reserve and a lot of economists are also wondering how does the macroeconomy work well i think uh i well first of all the macroeconomy works very differently than what you learn in a college you know macroeconomics class or or what uh a traditional uh finance uh academic finance uh education would give you um a big part of developing that understanding we sort of understanding and thinking about the intuitive cause effect drivers uh of the macroeconomy and asset classes uh and then from there taking that intuition about about those linkages right you know if if inflation comes in above expectations you would then expect bond yields to rise that's a simple linkage which you can then quantify what are the pressures on you know inflation to rise relative to the pressures relative to what's priced in into the bond market and you can start to quantify those linkages and then really all systemization is is the quantification and the uh and using that understanding in a repeated way over and over and over again right in a way that is disciplined which is a very you know the big the biggest benefit of systemization is quantification and discipline so often investors can can challenge if if you're a discretionary investor it can be very challenging to uh basically pursue keep keep true to your investment strategy because you're always being influenced by the incremental information that's out there and you may overreact or un underreact for instance to that incremental information and the the beauty of systemization is bringing that discipline helping synthesize a wide variety of information bring the discipline to execute the strategy as designed and so that you know that really is the is the core of it if you can if you do that um you know i think the important thing to recognize is in macro at least like your odds even the bestc investors in the world are wrong about 55% uh of are wrong about 45% of their bets in any one month um but if you do that if you you know have the coin on your side 55 45 and you flip it you know you trade a 100 markets that gives you a little bit of edge and if you could trade that over time you know at a 5545 ratio you're actually end up being you know one of the best investors in the world and so it's all you're the best blackjack player that's ever walked into the cas
Why Today's ETFs Are Different,2023-11-05 13:15:04+00:00,2,nFlQ02soX-8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFlQ02soX-8,a big a big part of the uh reason why actively managed strategies and more sophisticated actively managed strategies can come into the etf wrapper is the meaningful regulatory changes that occurred a few years ago that basically radically changed the framework in terms of using the etf rapper as a sophisticated asset manager i come from the fund space you know i was in the hedge fund business for 20 years and never even thought that a hedge fund rapper or that a etf wrapper could be the most efficient way both for for investors as well as operationally to run our product but when i learned about how much flexibility exists in the product um it really it really transformed my thought on it and so now we're able to run you know sophisticated hedge fund replication strategies in that etf wrapper because we can run long and short and leverage just as long as we maintain frankly common sense institutional quality uh risk controls that make sure that we don't get out of bound bounds with what we're doing and i think that is um increasingly we're going to see uh managers getting comfortable with the transparency which is an important thing and recognizing that you know the etf the etf world is the most efficient way to run sophisticated strategies and the reason why that is is because the tax efficiency if anything is actually better for actively managed strategies with moderate turnover than it is for uh traditional index strategies and so you get the execution ability you get the flexibility and you get the tax efficiency i mean what is there not to like about an actively managed etf these days well
What Should You Pay for Alpha?,2023-11-04 12:15:03+00:00,2,dfrMgJs-Qbo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfrMgJs-Qbo,yeah i i think that speaks to the tradeoff between the quality of the alphas and the fees so maybe in the active etf reper you have a bit you know you you do have to navigate the constraints that exist in the etf space which mean that you can't you know run highly quantitative intraday trading strategies and things like that but the question is if you're transitioning so maybe you get a little worse alpha than the the absolute best 2 and20 managers but you're shifting from going from paying three and 40 right 700 basis points of fees to now being able to pay under a 100 basis points of fees let's say and that's that's the most important thing remember alpha is uncertain fees are certain right and if you can bring down the fees the probability that the alphas that are being generated by the active managers uh that that you're investing in the probability that they deliver above those fees goes up considerably and so that's the tradeoff it's you're right you're not getting millennium in the etf wrapper but you're also not paying 3 and 40 with a 5-year lockup and that's the tradeoff
What Moves Might be Strategic For Investors in the Next 6 months,2023-11-03 21:00:05+00:00,2,72PKLGjb794,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PKLGjb794,um lastly just very quickly here for investors for the next six months what is the most important thing strategically that investors should keep in mind well i think frankly the biggest thing that they should keep in mind is uh is looking towards towards balance more balance in terms of their portfolio you know uh the typical 6040 portfolio is all in on disinflation and strong growth that may occur but there are uh a lot of circumstances you know if you look across markets basically markets are priced in all in on a soft landing environment occurring and there's lots of different ways in which that won't occur whether inflation ends up being a little more elevated and that benefits diversified commodities uh whether growth ends up being slower than expected which benefits bonds uh at the expense of stocks or whether frankly there's increased conflict relative to people's expectations which could particularly benefit gold and so i think a lot of ways the traditional 6040 positioning here is uh one of the the lowest uh the lowest uh probability portfolios that are out there and so most folks have to look for other assets and other positions that are going to put them uh into a situation where they can absorb a wider range of outcomes than currently priced in
Fed Pausing vs. Inflation Entrenchment,2023-11-02 12:15:02+00:00,4,A8SMhqkwqZM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8SMhqkwqZM,i think the main question continues to be what is the reaction function and i think that that ambiguity about the reaction function has been the challenge that most have had in the markets you know over the course of the last really year or so um what it looks like based upon the statement is that the emphasis is going to be around those risks those risks those financial market risks much more so than the risks that every day that inflation remains elevated there's an increasing risk that it becomes entrenched to be clear that's very normal early in a longer term inflationary cycle most central bankers uh are typically quite hesitant to meaningfully tighten in the in the face of inflation of elevated inflation pressures because the risks of tightening too much are relatively known and concerning and the risk of not tightening enough are basically things that play out for an extended period of time but odds are if the fed continues to take this extremely cautious path we and inflation continues to be elevated over time and we continue to have it seep in and get more entrenched in the economy the bigger mistake the fed will be thought of as making during this period is not getting too too started too late but it's going to be much more about the fact that they stopped hiking too early and that's the real risk for the fed that they'll have to do a whole heck of a lot more a year from now let's say because they've been too hesitant to today because they're concerned about financial risks bob i got to tell you it feels like you're in the minority here given at least compared with most of the folks we talk to right most of the people we talk to warn more of a policy mistake here from overtightening breaking something in the system is something we've heard from the likes of muhammad leri and and others i think greg is probably somewhat on the same page here that you you know we saw a little hint of it right with the regional banking crisis but it didn't blossom into something more how aren't you worried about that kind of a risk as well i think the question uh from the fed's perspective which is what they're trying to do what their mandate is is to preserve the highest quality medium-term growth by balancing both uh employment and price stability and when it comes to medium the thing that determines medium-term growth is productivity and the thing that determines prodct ity is this is price stability more than pretty much anything and so i think there are a lot of people out here talking uh based upon their life their life experience of a secular disinflationary environment where being responsive to growth was the prudent uh strategy because there was no cost to not being responsive to to inflationary pressures they didn't have to worry about inflation but we're in a different environment the world of 40 years of secular disinflation is over we're moving in the opposite direction and what we're seeing is across both the treasury and the fed a set of doish responses that if continued will put us on a path to a longer term higher inflationary environment and so it's true we've got to call up experiences like that of the 60s where we had expansionary deficits and monetary policy that was too easy that set the stage for the inflationary 70s those are the experiences that are most pertinent not people's experiences and views drawn from you know decades of disinflation and peace
Seven Steps to Recession (What Step Are We On?),2023-11-01 12:15:03+00:00,3,SYE2waN5zTA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYE2waN5zTA,we've had continuous turmoil in um in treasury space we're starting to see the spillovers to equities so i'd actually like to start with a sort of playbook that you've retweeted uh earlier today with seven steps from your playbook uh to the global macro environment please fill us in on these seven steps bob and why they matter yeah well i think this this sort of playbook i i started talking about it um when people were starting to buy were thinking it's time to buy bonds because i think sometime in the future uh a recession is going to hit and i took a step back and i said look there's a set of cause effect steps that are going to take us from where we were say in the spring of last year you know this year to a point in which we get recession and then eventually a point in which inflation is meeting the fed's mandate and the fed can significantly ease and so i i outline those steps the first step at the time rates need to rise um and we've basically seen that right rates are up more than 150 basis points since uh in the last six months uh particularly on the long end which hadn't sort of complied with the the tightening that the fed had been doing bringing up the short end and so we've seen the rate rise the second step is stocks fall for two basic reasons one stocks fall because there's a direct translation effect from uh from the interest rate rise to discounting of future cash flows which should bring stock prices down and two interest rates rising should lead to weaker economic conditions in the future we've seen a little bit of that so far and the reason why that is is interest rates have risen a fair amount would have implied something like a 20ish percent decline in stock prices if you duration match them but we've only had a a modest decline in stock about 10% from the peak depending on exactly how you look at it then the next steps are relative relatively clear which is that rise in rates and falls fall in stocks leads to demand slowing that demand slowing leads to earnings deterioration that earnings decline leads to weakening of labor markets that weaking of labor markets leads to lower wage growth and that lower wage growth eventually leads to inflation coming down towards the fed's target and so if you think about where we are in that cycle we're sort of halfway in between two uh and it's important that you remain disciplined through this sort of environment because um you don't want to get ahead of these dynamics on expectations of something that might happen in the future because you have to have these linkages play out to to get to the final point where we bottom an economic activity and see a renewed reacceleration
"Bond Yield Rises Are Self-Correcting, Which Is Very Different Than Stocks",2023-10-30 12:15:01+00:00,5,AUKtPOlZ3_I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUKtPOlZ3_I,the two things i'd say first of all when you think about the bond market um bond sell-offs are actually self-correcting and that's an important thing when to think about when you're thinking about bonds which is when you have a rise in bond yields there's basically two elements that occurs one they become more attractive because the yield rises and so you're expected forward return rises and that often brings in yield sensitive buyers and that's what we're seeing like you're seeing tlt which is the etf the long dat treasury etf has uh in price terms sold off as bond yields have risen but what youve seen is a lot of buyers come in because they start to say well bon yields at 5% i haven't seen that in 15 or 20 years that's actually a pretty good uh opportunity to come in there's good value in those securities so they're coming in yield sensitive buyers are coming in and i think the second thing which is important when you're thinking about bonds is that by their nature the rise in bond yields creates a drag on economic activity right through higher mortgage rates higher auto rates all those sort of borrowings that you do and that dragon economic activity limits future borrowing particularly by the private sector which then creates a slowdown in the economy which creates a bid for bonds and so when i talk about the bond dynamic we're basically seeing a constellation of things because bond bond uh uh yield rises are self-correcting we're starting to see that sort of natural floor that's that's coming in into the bond market and the thing that's interesting is if you just compare that to the equity market the equity market is self-reinforcing in terms of the price action and the equity market is only you know whereas bonds are down 50% from peak the equity market is down you know not much is the short story um and so you know when you think about which which markets are more or less vulnerable you know most of the repricing has happened in the bond market whereas we haven't really seen a meaningful repricing in the equity market that is okay that is really interesting because yeah um if they're signaling like look we have higher rates um that goes out into like i guess broader economic activity like not wanting to get a mortgage because of the high rates or auto all of that okay and so if you're a company too like i guess even issuing debt you'd have to pay back at like even higher rates right now too wouldn't you right which is which is a reason why you wouldn't want you know if if you could do anything you possibly can do to not borrow right now you'd basically do it right because the interest rate has is so elevated relative to history or income growth and things like that so that that's when i say as yields rise it actually stops the incremental borrowing that would typically occur from the private sector which would yeah that and that can be i wonder okay so bond market i suppose could be a bit of a sign of what could come in the economy then that's right right naturally there's macroeconomic linkages you know i think part of the part of the story that we've seen that's confused people is there's been a lot of of increase on the short end and the reality is that the us economy doesn't really very few people borrow on the short end basically no you know most corporations they don't issue floaters uh anymore most households aren't borrowing you know a floating rate mortgages and things like that they're borrowing on the longer term and so the the challenge with that is there's basically two things one the incremental borrowing has happens on the long end and so it's the it's the yield on long-term bonds that actually is a much bigger driver of the in of credit costs in the economy and so until those rows meaning f we actually didn't have as much a tightening of credit costs as we had move in short-term interest rates and then the second point which is it it also just takes some time which is that you know if you've already borrowed on a long-term basis let's say five or 10 years um you know you're you're not it doesn't matter what exactly is going on with interest rates today but basically corporations in particular to some extent households you know there is a fundamental or baseline need to borrow over time which can be sort of pushed off for you know for a short period of time but eventually like people move you know houses for all sorts of reasons right like you know you get married you get divorced you have kids all these sorts of normal baseline reasons why people have to move um and so you know there's there's going to be borrowing that happens over time and similarly corporations have financing needs you know particularly those corporations with negative cash flows have financing needs on an ongoing basis and so you know while they can delay six months or a year eventually they got to come to market and so that's why the duration of time is actually so important when you think about the effect of interest rates and elevated interest rates on the economy because anyone can delay for three or six or nine or 12 months but eventually someone you know folks have to borrow
Recession Probability Has Gone Up,2023-10-29 12:15:01+00:00,5,OYsP5AAz8Qk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYsP5AAz8Qk,well i think we were in a period for almost a year where many folks uh were expecting a very fast recession and that obviously has not transpired um if anything you know like basically unemployment rates today are the same as they were a year ago it's not to say we haven't seen some slowing of the economy um but the sort of recession now that had been expected both at the beginning of of the year and also right after the svb situation hasn't material ized and the reason why that is is because the economy is uh you know is not as sensitive to rate hikes as i think many people expected and on top of that macro cycles you know take a long time to play out it takes a long time for that elevated set of interest rates to flow through to slowing borrowing and slowing economic activity but i think the thing that is uh is particularly interesting today is that just at the time when you know after a year of no recession everyone's giving up on recession right in the asset markets how things are being priced is basically that we'll have a no a no landing or a soft landing scenario just as that's happening we're actually you know starting to see the dynamics that would typically align for a recession on a forward-looking basis and so i think that's a very interesting circumstance because particularly as you're trading financial markets you're always trading against what's priced in or what the consensus expectation is and i think just as you know everyone has given up on recession the probabilities of it have gone up considerably in the last few months yeah everyone's giving up on it the probabilities have gone up and you can correct me if i'm wrong but i believe like if you go back a year ago you weren't expecting a recession remember that there was that article that came out was like 100% probability i feel like you were you were not expecting it but i would do want to get a follow on here if like suddenly asset prices are pricing for the no landing soft landing but yet the dynamics are aligned for recession looking forward i want to hear more on that and are you now are you now expecting a recession going forward well yes i'm definitely expecting a recession to be clear i always expected a recession but what i said a year ago uh was that the recession would be much later than people expect and and also much harder um and i still believe that that dynamic is uh is is playing out uh if anything you know it's been a even a little later than i was a totally non-consensus when it came to how late it would be it's been even later than i expected i was thinking that it would be the last couple of months of 23 a year ago um it looks like through a variety of different for a variety of different reasons particularly tied to sort of the mini uh stimulus that has occurred on the fiscal side of things we're probably pushed into sort of you know march april of 2024 uh but there will be a recession and when i say the things are that conditions are aligning you're getting the type of typical dynamics that uh that lead to the ordering that creates the recession which is that we had a tightening on the short end we've now had a meaningful rise in long end interest rates we're starting to see stock prices fall in response to that they haven't fallen that much and in fact they haven't even fallen that much relative to how far bonds have fallen but stocks are starting to fall and we're starting to see the underlying weakening in those cyclical sectors as well as in the labor markets which are um starting to soften a little bit in a bunch of different ways and that whole dynamic is basically putting us on a path where you know something like three to six months from now we're mo most likely to see a deterioration that's coming at a time when particularly when you look at the equity market expectations of uh earnings growth are relatively extreme you know right now the equity market is pricing in a 25% increase in earnings over the course of 24 and 25 so so that's pretty high particularly when you think about you know what nominal gdp growth is like likely to be um and so that's really the divergence which is uh very very high expectations of earnings growth in the bond market in the stock market at a time when we're starting to see those macroeconomic dynamics align for uh a recessionary experience in early 24
What is the trade-off of Active vs. Passive Investment Funds?,2023-10-28 12:15:01+00:00,3,VGFVmumO2s4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGFVmumO2s4,and talking about the the active versus passive kind of debate right i think the big knock on active or what you might hear from from more of the passive people is about performance and long over long terms and how some things might outperform or not outperform and i'm wondering if there's any kind of truth or how that kind of plays out and and how you all kind of think about that i know i saw some data just today from morning star that 57% of actively managed funds outperformed passive counterparts in 2022 so i don't know if that's narrative is changing or you know who do you believe who's doing the data who's doing the research but how do you guys think about that and u maybe we'll start with you bum well i think the basic question whenever you're think about active management is that tradeoff between the quality of the alpha that that manager is bringing against the costs that they're charging to deliver that alpha that's that's the basic trade-off every time and so when we talk about typically when we talk about uh the fact that active managers often underperform their passive benchmarks the issue is not that they can't generate alpha the issue is the fees are too high and that is a critically important tradeoff that you have to think about anytime you're evaluating an active strategy and i think one of the things just going back to what i just said that has really changed by bringing the sort of active etf infrastructure in place is that those sorts of strategies that are say sophisticated enough to run in you know typically 2 and2 style structure and fund structures many of them not all but many of them can be brought into the etf style wrapper right and they can be run in a much more efficient way and what that means is that for most investors we're increasingly seeing their ability to access better alpha better active management in a way that's cheaper for the uh for the operator for the issuer to execute and that combination of things means that we're likely to see better outcomes for investors net of fees when it comes to active management than we've seen you know with the old traditional mutual funds or 2 and20 fund products
Using A.I. In Systematic Trading,2023-10-27 12:15:01+00:00,3,DKF9guVmWL8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKF9guVmWL8,well as a person who's been building systematic investment strategies for more than 20 years like i've seen all sorts of techniques let's say in a lot of ways like you know what is ai well first of all ai is a whole bunch of things right ranging from large language models to highly quantitative technical models right so ai doesn't really mean anything you had to get under the hood to understand what is the actual tool and what is the use case and there's a lot of instances where particularly in higher frequency high volumes of data where uh you know certain ai models make a lot of sense because they're engaged in that pattern recognition there's enough sample size for it to make sense there's other areas as you said like global macro where there's been you know seven cycles since 1950 where like ai on seven data points is no good whereas ai on you know a trillion pictures of cats is good right and so you pick as a as a systematic investor you have to pick the tool that fits the problem and so that's the key key thing to be looking at and for us i think uh in the in the hedge fund replication space what is neat is that there has been a lot of innovation in the tooling relative to to when even this idea started so if you go back 20 years andrew low he was running you know rolling regressions over three five 10 years to try and understand what hedge funds we're doing well fast forward to today the world is very different we can now run you know million simulation basian models on portfolio positioning you know in the matter of a few minutes right a much faster more efficient more accurate way of being able to understand what these managers are doing and in a way that allows us to sort of capture in a much more tactical sense how they're shifting their positioning but the way you do that is not by just uh applying whatever model exists you know just picking anything out of the air and applying it it's looking at the problem understanding the the best strategies and techniques that are available and consistently applying and evolving bringing those great techniques to the four ultimately any use of this technology is an investment decision and that's why it's very important that you to recognize that it's not like just some technologist off the street can just say well i just create ai and it just does an investment strategy anything that is actually going to be robust and successful requires decades of deep experience having built this understanding the limitations of the technology and applying the right tools to the right problem to solve the investment problem at hand
What’s Driving the Repricing of Bonds?,2023-10-26 12:15:02+00:00,2,MpDtxcULgo0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpDtxcULgo0,i want to pick up on your point about what's driving some of the increase in yields and the volatility peter shear of academy securities pointing the finger at washington writing quote the recent moves and yields have almost nothing to do with the fed and everything to do with fiscal policy the 10-year treasury almost pierced 5% because no one knows what dc is going to do and what we can surmise is not good bob how much does this change your feeling on a broader level just about bonds as a haven asset and pushes you toward other asset classes well i think a lot of the repricing of the increased supply in bonds has mostly happened and when i look across assets the biggest question i'm looking at is what other assets are out there are not reflecting the meaningful uh rise in term premiums that we've seen the meaningful rise in in uh in bond yields uh you know if you think about bonds particularly on the long end they've fallen about 50% from peak and you look across assets for instance stocks that remain just off highs so if i'm thinking about which assets are overvalued in this market it sure isn't bonds it's much more stocks not bonds
What a Major Geopolitical Conflict Means for Markets,2023-10-25 12:15:02+00:00,5,TebCjSF3-7Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TebCjSF3-7Q,we have a geo situation that we have to keep at least one eye on and i went to your stream bob and you actually you know try to explain to people uh what it's like to have a a war economy and you know what it means for markets can you share that with our viewers today yeah i mean i think none of us basically have any idea what it's like to live through a major global conflict right i mean we haven't seen uh you know if anything actually i i showed some charts on there which i thought were interest i hadn't seen before i started looking into it which is that like global conflict is at like orders of magnitude lower than the sort of norms of the last 600 years and so you know that's basically how our our careers and frankly my whole life has uh has been in that sort of state um yeah and and the issue with um with conflicts is that basically if if you just think about it from a fundamentalist perspective what you're doing is you're digging stuff out of the ground and you're creating production and then destroying it right that's the that's the basic thing and then you're financing it with large deficits usually through yield suppression in order to keep the financing costs down and you put that all together and what does that mean that means it's a bad you know inflation is elevated even though growth is elevated inflation is elevated it's a you know both of those things are bad for bonds on a real basis typically bad for stocks because the economic rents basically go to the government rather than to the producer uh of the products for variety of reasons that are probably intuitive the war machine go yeah the war machine right it's just that's that's that's the way it works we socialize the productive capacity in one form or another um and then the other elements are you know commodities do very well because you're digging them out of the ground and destroying it uh and and gold does well in that environment as well because it's essentially the only only you know the only money that's not being debased by governments in order to pursue the war effort and so you put that combination together you know that's essentially a a the best portfolio is gold and commodities and like then you think about how people are basically positioned strategically which is bonds and socks and they're basically totally uh underwe side the fence right totally underweight uh rising conflict yeah and i know that you're a believer in gold as part of the mix of a portfolio so i mean i know you're a gold watcher was that was that one of the most dramatic rallies you've seen in gold in a long time and what did it do put 200 almost well $150 on well i think the thing that's really interest so gold you got to think about it's basically two things it's a geopolitical hedge uh which we all sort of know but it's also non- yields bearing money and so when you think about gold in general actually you want to think about it relative to bonds because you know bonds pay a yield and gold doesn't pay a yield and so even when i trade it or think about it i'm trading a diff position rather than an outright position i think the thing that's pretty amazing is how well gold has done relative to bonds um which i you know in in the last few weeks i mean structur over the last three years it's done fantastically well relative to bonds but but even in the last few weeks i think that speaks to the bid it's getting from the geopolitical tensions and like these are the sorts of things like you know gold gold has high high high convexity to these sorts of events and so it's why you know portfolio you actually don't need that much gold to protect yourself but it doesn't take a lot of incremental buying to start to create meaningfully sized price action in gold and so i think that's kind of what we're seeing is like you know in the grand scheme the situation in israel is terrible um and you know is a is uh is contributing to increasing global tensions in the grand scheme of you know global conflicts it is not certainly not yet uh nearly as substantial as those previous global con conflicts but we're still getting a significant bit in gold because it has that convexity so i think that's that's what you have to that's why gold is a great asset to hold as a small position in a diversified portfolio
What is Happening With Banks? (after 3Q earnings),2023-10-24 12:15:01+00:00,4,9bj7jA6kR6U,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bj7jA6kR6U,i'm looking at the banks bob so you know i think there was a warning on our terrible earnings friday on one the regionals and uh even though the bonds have stopped going down like they're coming off niagra falls they're grinding down yeah um these banks are in worse shape now because yields are higher than they were in march uh are do we still have a banking crisis going on i think you know i think we have the banking problem is a little is a little subtle right now because those banks are not creating good earnings right those are bad equity investments okay but they're not necessarily systemically a problem right take take a region's financial still running a three and a half nim with you know 60 basis points of npls like from a from a from the perspective of a bank uh uh from like a systemic perspective from the likelihood that that bank failing is very low very very low now the likelihood that that bank kind of sucks as an equity holder is reasonably high but what the fed cares about is not if holding region's financial you know stock is a good return they don't care about that what they care about is whether the bank is going to fail and they've done a pretty good job putting themselves in a position to ensure that the banks aren't going to fail but for equity holders you know it's it's not going to be it's not going to be a pleasant ride here yeah and it's not just the regionals uh it's yeah some of the money centers and and we're actually seeing that i put something out this weekend which shows that actually the financial pressure that you're starting to see is actually in the largest banks the largest 25 banks are actually seeing the biggest financial pressure where they saw less pressure after s svb whereas the small banks are actually doing okay um why why is it the flow of deposits has gone towards the big money center banks why is has that become uh created more pressure on their financials well i think um a lot of those money center banks you know are still holding and when i say money center banks i mean you have bank of america which is still holding too much duration and then the regionals are really in that space it's really the the super regionals that are feeling that pressure whereas frankly the the stickiness of smaller banks you know like your you know xyz credit union or you know the small bank in your hometown like those banks they have very sticky deposits like people bank with them on a relationship basis and it's not you know it's not that bad um and those banks are actually seeing some resetting of their yields that they're getting on their incremental loans and so if you're running you know a bank with 50 100 $250 million of assets it's actually like a pretty it's like not a terrible time okay well what's wrong with goldman i don't know i i don't i i mean they're supposedly best of breed right they're always the smartest i i don't know i don't you know i i like when goldman goes down because they didn't hire me and i had to go work for jt and and i had to go work for jt marlin well doing all right for yourself now you remember jt marlin in that movie boiler room baby
How Can a POW Camp Explain Macroeconomics?,2023-10-23 12:15:00+00:00,3,7XXboaAEv9s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XXboaAEv9s,what it allowed you know you us to see is that even in you know a relatively unusual uh environment the same sort of macroeconomic dynamics that ex that exist in the in the global macroeconomy existed in this relatively you know defined and constrained environment so you know even you know basic things basic things like the idea of um of people exchanging uh money today for money tomorrow so it's called bread today versus bread wednesday right and what is the time value of being able to eat your bread today versus giving your bread to someone and getting more bread in in five days right and that's a fundamental concept of all of uh of all of the capitalist system right because it's people giving up their money for an expectation of earning more money in the future it also has great lessons on monetary policy which is that um you know the the way monetary policy worked there cigarettes were the primary form of currency for a variety of different reasons and so what you saw was when there was an influx of cigarettes you saw prices rise as a function of that in cigarette terms and then uh one of the interesting things about cigarettes is that they uh had a a use a use not just uh for money purposes so they were then smoked and then you had a deflationary environment in the economy which then lowered prices over time until the next instance in which cigarettes were delivered by the red cross and so that's a perfect example of a monetary cycle that existed in the context of this overall environment and so you know when i think about the economy just more generally and kind of goes to your your original your your first question i think in many ways they're these sort of really core drivers of of what drives people's economic behavior no some rational some irrational and if you understand the way in which people uh behave if you understand those sort of core economic drivers and behaviors then you can really start to see you know the macroeconomy is just really a summation of everyone behaving in those ways everyone thinking about what is bread worth to me today versus tomorrow they might be thinking about televisions today versus tomorrow but you know the same basic concept holds and so these sort of laboratories of behavior really help clarify and understand what are those sort of core fundamental relationships drivers of the macroeconomy and markets that we can apply you know as we're as we're living uh our dayto day and trying to understand what's happening
Commodities (and Gold) Perform Well in Periods of Conflict,2023-10-22 12:15:00+00:00,4,-68J0He5Ya0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-68J0He5Ya0,why would you invest in commodities why would you touch gold or even silver in a situation like that what's the benefit of having that because we've already discussed the fact that people generally don't have that in their portfolios i think everyone here who's a bitcoiner or into crypto at least superficially understands why you would but these returns in these situations are remarkable i'm talking about it here commodities do very well during war periods from the time of pearl harbor till the end of the war commodities delivered a 100% return right yeah 100% % real return too um and so i think that that is uh uh you know commodities basically in conflicts there's a limited supply of you know physical assets that go into the production of you know uh of armaments that are used during a wartime period as well as the fuel necessary to accomplish it and during a wartime period basically everyone is scrambling to get their hands on those resources um you know the us is in a good position structurally along those dimensions but it doesn't mean that there isn't a price squeeze on those assets and that's essentially what we see here which is when you take a diversified portfolio of commodities basically all commodities go up during a wartime period and that's essentially what we've seen you know in a very in in a much smaller way uh over the course of the last uh 10 days or so following the the rising conflict in in the midd east right obviously we talked quite a bit already about the 6040 uh here in any longer term perspective multi-decade period of low conflict is extremely unusual obviously that's talking about now right so we we've really had sort of an unprecedented time and we still do guys to be frank right this is a regional war again much like ukraine and russia for now but this is actually an unprecedented time of peace that we've really had yeah i mean i i found that chart to be very interesting a 600-year perspective on uh on the amount of conflict the amount of global conf conflict and just how extremely low um that has been over the last 30 or 40 years in in many ways most of us probably don't even appreciate uh that it is so low because it's basically been that way during our you know the entire time of our you know formative professional careers as well as our lives and that in any context um you would certainly not expect to see even lower global conflict or would want to necessarily thatt even lower global conflict and what i' emphasize here this is not what i'm what we're talking about here is not a a a view that there will be no no particular insight because i frankly don't think that i i certainly don't have any particular insight in whether there'll be more or less conflict in the future it's just recognizing that um 6040 is an all-in bet on no conflict and there's likely to be some conflict in the future that you want to protect yourself against in the case that you see that
Banking Sector Stability Remains but Fed Tightening is Having Impact,2023-10-21 12:15:07+00:00,3,xQmwSGyfh78,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQmwSGyfh78,joining us now to talk more about banks and the broader market is unlimited co-founder and ceo bob elliot i'm getting used to friday bob i like having you here it's usually rainy here as well we got to fix that it is so um leslie mentioned we're at these lows on the k since may we're also i think at a low for the nasdaq since may what to make of all that well i think when you look at the banks we are starting to see uh some concerns that are emerging not so much for the banks not so much for the small banks but sort of those those regionals stuck in the middle are starting to see some pressure they still have a little too much duration on their balance sheet they're still seeing obviously some hits as a result of the bond selloff these are the sorts of things that are not quite big enough to be a a big deal to the fed to cause them to to pause or or or hesitate in terms of keeping monetary policy tight as it is but it is enough to obviously scare shareholders in ter in terms of uh what the forward- looking picture look looks like okay so bigger picture your position i think still is that we're late cycle a recession is coming that's different from what atlanta fed president rafael bosk said on squawkbox this morning he said no recession coming you still expect a recession you have any uh perspective on on how deep and how soon well i think one of the things that of course the fed's not going to going to sit there and tell you that a recession is coming uh relatively quickly particularly when they're holding tight monetary policy in place but it's the sort of thing where just as everyone is sort of giving up on this recession because it's come you know much later than most people have expected the the storm clouds are gathering right you've got you know the backup in bond yields that move is directly hitting incremental borrowing and the vast majority of borrowers you've got frankly the fact that we've had a longer and longer term of elevated bond bond yields which means that those who have hesitated to borrow are now starting to run down their cash piles and now starting to face a need for increased borrowing ahead and the fact that you're starting to see weakening in various more uh cyclical sectors of the economy housing had popped and now is rolling over employment you know here and there is getting weaker and weaker and so the odds that we get out of this without having a meaningful slowdown in economic activity are pretty unlikely
What Happens in the Economy During War?,2023-10-20 12:15:00+00:00,4,EcpdwB7M8EU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcpdwB7M8EU,wars by their nature are inflationary as goods requiring raw materials are produced and then destroyed without an increase in productive capacity they're also a bad time for cash since governments keep financing costs low cash is the worst asset as seen in us 35 to 40 and here's that chart for anybody who can't see it so let's talk about that yeah well you know basically what happens during a war right is that you create materials and then you destroy them through the course of pursuing a conflict um and that by nature is inflationary because uh typically when you invest or you you build things you're doing it to increase future productive capacity and in a war you're essentially destroying productive capacity and using those raw materials so you get that squeeze and you get that rise in inflation the same thing is happening the same thing at the same time what's happening is that governments need to finance the war effort and almost always keep interest rates artificially low relative to those price rises in order to essentially socialize the cost of the war financing to the entire economy through the tax that is inflation and so basically what you see is holding cash is a particularly bad asset because not only is the yield a lot lower than it should be during normal times but also inflation is elevated you put those two things together and while cash may feel safe during a conflict environment it actually you know has a significant erosion of purchasing power right and here's the bond real return as you've showed here also from 35 to 4050 so basically i mean most the examples you're giving here are based on world war ii correct sort of the base case world war ii i would say is you know obviously the most extreme international conflict that we've seen you know in the last you know since since the 1700s and so um i think it's useful not to say that necessarily these are the exact price dynamics that we'll experience but it is useful to understand how the linkages work right how the dynamics work um and i wrote this you know as a simple example i wrote this you know right on the on the monday after uh the the um hamas terrorist activities in israel and you know if you look at how things have played out since that point like gold is up bonds have sold off right stocks haven't done very well not nearly as extreme as what's presented here but it you know it's the conflict itself on a global perspective is smaller as well as the fact that you know it's been shorter in duration so i think these things are useful on the bond side just an important thing to highlight is just how um when you have increased war efforts you have increased government financing and so they have to issue a lot of bonds and again both on the short end and on the long end they depress yields usually by fixing yields in one form or another as bonds are issued during that war time to socialize the cost as well what i find so fascinating is that yes we have the example now of hamas and israel but we also just had the debt ceiling lifted when we had 31 trillion in debt and now we're over 33 so the government is already doing this right we obvious often talk here about the difference between monetary policy that people fixate on and fiscal policy when it comes to the treasury but we're effectively already doing this without being in wartime right we're issuing we're issuing trillions of dollars in bonds we know that there's less demand for those than there historically was in fact they're even selling off as you said so we're already seeing this without even having the that's right that's right i mean we're running uh recession like deficits at a time when you know unemployment the unemployment rate is at 50 or 75 year lows and so that is an unusual circumstance and suggests uh a level of fiscal um uh expansionary fiscal policy that is unusual to say the least at at a time when the economy is doing you know reasonably well all things considered
Inflation Entrenchment (How it Happens),2023-10-19 12:15:00+00:00,3,HsP6NM0DT_M,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsP6NM0DT_M,you know at at the basic level you know inflation in some ways is a mechanical uh exercise which is you know what's nominal spending what's the productive capacity of the economy and the difference between those two must be essentially the change prices right it's it's it's uh it it's mechanistic in that way but it's also uh it's also a psychological phenomenon and when i say that you know kind of sounds like i'm talking about like astrology or something like no like what it is is it's a set of expectations that you know start to be put into people's minds and then they behave on the on on those expectations and so as an example i mean here's a very very simple example i'm sure you experienced this some to some extent yourself like when you sign contracts with vendors right like the way the contract works is you know there's a whole contract and then it says and this will reprice you know 2% uh in 12 months you know unless you cancel right and so that's a very simple simple thing that's in a bunch of different you know in typical business contracts well you know before the coid the way it worked was all the said 2% or 3% or something like that and the way it's worked in this period of high of elevated inflation is more and more of those contracts say five and then they say 10 and then they say 15 right and that is inflation entrenchment because what it means is essentially no matter what when that contract comes due 12 months from now then i will have to there's embedded inflation in that contract right there prices will rise in the future as a result of those contractual obligations and that is that is like the quintessential version i mean that's a very tangible version of what inflation entrenchment is and so the the basic risk that the fed has is every day that inflation in general is elevated and above their target people are making decisions that are predictive of elevated inflation in the future which necessarily creates or almost mechanistically creates the inflation the realized inflation when it occurs and it's only if you start to see the slowing you know and that i should say that also that's a contractual version of it but it also happens in wages and and other pre you know future agreed upon prices and the only way to slow that process is to weaken the economy because if you know the vendor is facing a tight economy they'll put in the 10 or 15 % step up 12 months forward but if you're the only client that they have available and you say no i'm not going to pay 10% then they'll bring that down in order to make the contract more attractive to you and so that's how inflation entrenchment occurs and how it gets resolved through a weakening of economic conditions
Why I Share Thougths on Twitter/X,2023-10-18 20:15:00+00:00,2,GZ1uzdaedZg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ1uzdaedZg,like how this happened was my basic idea was uh i actually started my twitter account started because i just wanted to like basically communicate with some of my old colleagues friends things like that about what i was thinking in markets and so i just started writing you know in the morning and in the afternoon in the evening like here's what i'm thinking about markets right because when you're a market participant when you're running money you know it's not a part-time job you don't just like casually check out of markets like you're constantly sitting there going what do i think's going to happen what's actually happening with the incremental information what's happening with market prices how do those things intersect and then re recreating your synthesis all the time about what's going on what's likely to happen where are there opportunities in markets and so that's really how that whole my twitter is really born and to be clear it's basically what it is today which is every day i basically wake up look at what's going on in markets look at the data look at the market pricing and write what's on my mind um which is kind of incredible apparently people are are halfway interested in what i have to say which is uh which has been a surprise but i think it it does reflect the fact that there's a lot of people out there particularly like financial advisors or smaller scale investors who don't really have access to institutional quality insights about what's going on in in the markets in a consistent way in a data driven way all of those things there's there's obviously some you know a handful of great commentators that are out there that are engaging with people in the in those uh enironment like yourselves but um but you know it's it's it's it's hard it's hard for say you're an advisor with you know 500 million bucks in you know suburban chicago like the big banks aren't writing research reports for you right you don't have access to that quality of of insight and so it's actually been you know quite quite remarkable and quite fun honestly talking to a lot of these folks who are as sophisticated as anybody in terms of what's going on
TIPS as an Asset,2023-10-18 12:15:00+00:00,5,1Bp2duQ7ITk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bp2duQ7ITk,so our friend brian is asking hey brian uh daris bob for the life of me i don't understand tips will you please provide some guidance into what actually drives these investments and what may make them appropriate now ah tips i you know uh i i love tips um talking about tips you know they they've been they've been like the uncool asset class for like 25 years so uh i i love the fact that people are coming back to them so tips if you think about them um what are they uh tip is treasury inflation ed security um what that means is that the way that they work is that they offer a real interest rate they pay a coupon just like a normal treasury bond does but the way that coupon and the ultimate principle is calculated is that you get a real coupon a real uh return or interest rate and then you get inflation as it actually occurs uh as it actually accumulates over time and so uh you know if you buy a 10-year tip and you have a you know a 1% real yield on it you'll get one each you know every six months you'll get a 1% coupon plus whatever the accumulated inflation is from the time that you bought it to the time the coupon was issued and then of course at the end you'll get your principal back the $100 face value of the principal plus whatever the uh accumulated inflation is and so i think that's important because what what tips really are are two things one it's a long it's a long-term instrument that uh provides return of actual realized inflation very important so it is a inflation protection hedge but number two is the price of tips just in the same way um i'm sure your viewers understand that you know bond yields if yields go up bond prices go down and the returns are negative and vice versa the way you think about tips is the same thing except instead of thinking about um in instead of think about the overall bond yield which includes the real interest rate and the break even inflation expectations of inflation and the real interest rate tips prices are only affected by the real interest rate moves and so i think one of the things that's challenging with them is what you see is in times when inflation is elevated typically what happens is the central bank responds with elevated real interest rates to slow the economy that's actually bad for tips prices right because real interest rates go up which means the prices of those bonds go down right just at the time when inflation is going up right so it's very confusing assets like you're protect you you claim this is inflation protection but it's going down while inflation is happening and that's because they are a real interest rate bond plus a crude inflation and so one of the things i think is really interesting in that market is if you think about how how it's going right now like most of the tightening has been through the real interest rate when we started uh the cycle whenever uh uh back in january 2022 to today we've had almost 300 basis points of real interest rate 3 b points or more of real interest rate tightening right that's a huge change in terms of the expected future yield on those on those bonds and so what that now means is you know we're getting mid 2% type real return which if you look back through time um on those bonds is about as good as it gets yeah um in in the middle of the financial crisis there was like liquidity issues and they traded into the threes but i mean that's what but like you know the difference between two and a half and three is like let's not get greedy here like three is basically about as good as it would ever come and i think those instruments on a forward-looking basis because the yield is so so high so elevated at a time when inflation has hasn't been beat but inflation has come down meaningfully the tightening cycle is largely over and the fed might need to ease real interest rates more much more than people expect in order to reacceleration are actually pretty attractive on affordable basis and so absolutely it gives you a sense uh uh for tips as a as an asset class definitely something to to check out and think about today 100 perc i have nothing to add that was fantastic my friend
The Evolution of the Bond Market (over the last 18 months),2023-10-17 20:15:02+00:00,4,ZI2wqAjqYfI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI2wqAjqYfI,absolutely speaking of the bond move you've done a lot of work uh recently about the backup in bond yields the the the sort of the changing the evolution of the demand in the treasury curve and also this sort of shock that we've seen in the last couple of months on ter premum what are your sort of kind of summary thoughts there we can sort of unpack it as we go well i think the the big picture of thoughts is we've we've moveed we move basically from an unsustainable bond market situation where there was you know massive government supply huge money printing um and very low yields to i think a bond market today that looks a lot more i should also say and and there was relatively strong growth and high inflation right like that's kind of where we were if you go if you roll the clock back 18 months and um and that suite of conditions created you know through time a relatively significant up move in the bond yield right we you know wasn't that long ago when 10year bonds were like below 150 um and so which you know it's hard hard to believe but is the reality right that that is a that is a that is something that has happened before i mean just a few years ago and i think basically i i i think those folks who remain bearish on the bond market are like extrapolating that dynamic at a time when the market composition has radically changed and it's radically changed because the price has changed and so what's happened is it's true the fed has gone from buying to selling right and the government deficit well the government deficit was super high you know but the government deficit was super high and will be less high in in the future on the margin but the big thing that's gone on is that all of those yield sensitive buyers have started to come in and so i i showed a chart on twitter this morning you know yield sensitive buyers which just households etfs and mutual funds which are household you know direct and indirect purchases they went from basically zero when bond yields were at you know 150 basis points to now buying $ 1.5 trillion dollar of uh of of bonds today okay well that's a that's a big difference right that's a big difference $1.5 trillion dollar annualized pace that's basically enough to cover the the bond issuance necessary for the deficit okay well that you know that's a radically different thing and and that's how and this is how bond cycles work which is that um which is that uh the the cure the you know the modified version of the old classic tail the cure for higher yields is higher yields right like that's that is the cure right and and it almost mechanically that the cure for higher yields is that yield sensitive buyers come in and you see that like even as tlt and price terms has sold off right the the inflows into that into those etfs have surged um because investors buy bonds on yield they don't buy bonds on price which is smarter because yield is better representation of expected return and so we're seeing that play out now we're kind of in a in a in a in a in a stasis here where you know basically like we can reasonably explain why you know it's reasonable to expect that at roughly these yields will be able to fill even relatively sizable deficits
Global Stocks Are Cheap (relative to U.S. Stocks),2023-10-17 12:15:04+00:00,4,ksZGfFcdTts,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksZGfFcdTts,as we look across other asset markets like i think we've gotten really sort of stuck in what's going on in the in in you know us mega cap stocks like us mega cap stocks which you know everyone has g have gone up a lot in everyone's focus on are essentially the most expensive financial assets in the world uh and so i think it's one of these times where we really have an opportunity to look sort of outside the us uh sphere and try and start to find value like maybe you know we likely are going to see some economic weakness ahead the question is where do we find the best value uh globally particularly in the equity market and i think what you see here is uh this is drawn from a tweet that i i put out a couple of weeks ago which is you know in the us we have an earnings yield of you know give or take you know 5% but when you look at other equity markets around the world particularly price in dollar terms what you see is they offer meaningfully more meaningfully higher earnings yields uh as well as the fact that their prices have not significantly risen i mean like look across all those gold lines like basically all those asset markets all those stock markets are where they were five years ago whereas the us equity market is up 60% and just like in bond prices in the us what we see is basically that us stocks are are radically mispriced rel to the rest of the world coming into a time when we're like where expectations are extremely elevated where bond yields have gone up a significant amount and haven't been discounted uh and where uh you know economic momentum is starting to weaken you sort of look at that whole picture and it's not a good one for holding us stocks if you need equity exposure it's definitely worth looking outside the us where there's much more conservative outcomes priced into these markets and and in particular uh what you see on the uh on the lower right hand side there is that a big reason why that this is is because the us dollar has been you know the dominant you know has had experienced one of the biggest rallies uh you know over the course of the last uh decade in its history and it is at or near long-term uh elevated levels uh typically when we transition in a cycle from a period where the fed is meaningfully tighter than the rest of the world to where the fed is starting to ease that really is the time when you start to get these turns uh in in the dollar market you can see that i think actually 2000 uh is is an interesting time where you started to see the 2000 cycles where you started to see that turn um and we very well could see a similar dynamic playing out here as well and that would only reinforce the beneficial aspects of holding global stocks not only are they good from an from a yield perspective but from a price perspective a falling dollar would typically be beneficial for us investors holding those assets
Credit Market Dynamics,2023-10-16 12:15:00+00:00,3,-TBtyLLpRAw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TBtyLLpRAw,what do you what do you think about this whole credit credit channel because yes fisc higher interest rates are simulative to people who are have money at a a money market account but presumably if you you know think it's a late cycle you think so because of the rise of interest rates and the lag you know we're finally there you know people have been talking about an invertive curve since the spring of 2022 it's been a long time um and that's you know presumably i presume why you think it's late cycle we we've seen credit meaningfully slowed actually last year like a lot of people certainly in the banking system a lot of people are were really focused on svb like essentially nothing happened before and after svb like all the credit slowing happened last year um you know we went from banks in 2022 extending credit at a very rapid pace to basically zero um by by early 2023 and that's reflect that's a typical macroeconomic dynamic that occurs uh when you get a tightening just in the same way we saw the bond market slow bond market issuance slow which is another credit market dynamic um but you know as as mike points out there's there's um there's still the sort of uh reasonable amount of liquidity in the system and combined with um with a a set of financial asset infrastructures that don't force mark to market uh are creating what you know what has been a bit of a boom in the private credit space um that is sort of continuing the cycle um you know on the margin and and maybe not even really continuing the economic cycle so much as holding up asset prices particularly in a liquid securities but for those folks who have been around a little while and have seen this dynamic play out which is you know lending the incremental the last lending the last dollar to the soon to be bankrupt en we know how this ends which is you know you you have good marks for a few months or a few years and then you lose your shirt on um and that's probably what we're likely to see and that i think uh interestingly um the fact that we haven't seen a real credit cycle in the private credit markets is i think exacerbating the capital that's flowing into those places and will uh will mean that there's much many more much more significant losses uh in the future as a result rather than if people really had a good fundamental understanding of what credit cycles work i i talk to some private credit folks um who will with i believe a straight face tell me that private credit is an uncorrelated asset to the equity market and that is crazy
More Thoughts on Bitcoin,2023-10-15 20:15:00+00:00,4,V_17xrCZxkk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_17xrCZxkk,it has the most vociferous and you know uh maniacal holding base that basically is unwilling to supply any as the price goes higher right it has that characteristic that as it goes up people are convinced that it's actually demonstrating the validity of their arguments and therefore they're more willing to hold as it goes higher in price that's just another way of saying it's it's highly inelastic in its construction right and when it goes down people turn around and say the exact same oh look this is just proof this is what it does right and you know it shows your emotional and mental character to be able to hold it through periods of time when it's falling in price right so it's an asset that appreciates when it goes up and it tests your metal and makes you a stronger human being when it goes down right it's a it's a man for all seasons perfect just i mean but just go again to the empirics around the geopolitical hedge like how did it do in 2022 uh poor very poorly i think poor i think it was down yeah is definitely down part of the reason why i'm emphasizing this is that um we owe it as respected commentators giving giving perspective on how financial assets work we owe it to people to speak plainly and literally and truthfully about how things perform in different market environments right to recognize when there's uncertainty but also to highlight when things um are playing out in a certain way because it is critical as fiduciaries and i mean that sort of in a broad sense of fiduciaries that we don't that we that we represent the reality to people whether you like you know whether we like the reality or not whether we're right or wrong on our trades right and so i think it's this is a good example where there is a lot of uncertainty and where i think we can there's a lot of uncertainty and frankly there's a lot of misinformation critically wrong misinformation in the market that's being presented to people where we have a responsibility to be very clear about how things are working and to and particularly when we see these stress tests and to to call balls and strikes um whether we like or not right whether it's cons you know whether it's it helps our pocketbook or not call the balls and strikes on how for instance this asset is performing relative to the thesis that exist and i continue i repeatedly am are seeing i'm repeatedly seeing in these scenarios the thesis being the thesis being rejected by the empirical evidence and so that that you know that that's just the functional reality of the circumstance i'm open-minded you know i saw some indications that maybe it was trading with gold for a very short period of time uh earlier in the year but you know when we get these stress t test cases like it it's it's um we have to speak plainly about the realities
Thoughts on Bitcoin,2023-10-15 12:15:07+00:00,4,yGKpVTWN_w8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGKpVTWN_w8,we just with with bitcoin we just don't know how it trades as a financial asset like what mike's saying about you know gold being a bet on real rates is is something that has been established over literally millennia right that concept the trade-off between gold and paper currency and yielding paper currency is something you know that we've that connection that linkage and dynamic we've seen it across millennia across you know china the us europe you know japan like we've seen it in all sorts of different environments over those millennia to be able to in a very compelling way understand that that is the the most probable linkage i think the basic question with bitcoin is who knows like we haven't even gone through a real recession with bitcoin right other i mean the the acute dynamics in 2020 but we haven't really seen it as a simple example i thought it was very interesting how bitcoin traded in response to uh to the to the recent uh conflict in in israel right i thought this was very interesting which is gold traded up bonds rallied and bitcoin fell and if if you really think that bitcoin is a contra currency that's likely to benefit from uh from you know in in from rising geopolitical tensions right you would have expected it to rally in that environment and so like these are the sorts of like these are that's a little test case right like how much you know gold traded the way it's supposed to bonds byy and large traded way they they were supposed to equities the same way like how much confidence can you have in an asset that when you have what is essentially you know in the in the obviously it's a terrible circumstance and and a terrible um dynamic that's the terrible situation that's occurring there but it is you know in in a global context it's a relatively modest um con you know rise in conflict that's occurring and you're seeing the dynamics of the market play out in a way that is inconsistent with what certainly i've been told by the bitcoin community about how it'll trade yes what was it pa trer jones who said recently that gold and bitcoin are a geopolitical hedge sure but they traded a whole heck of a lot differently right and those geopolitical hedges like the question the way that you understand it as a geopolitical hed ed is based on the fundamentals which i think mike has highlighted a very important part of the fundamentals which is you do have a liability you know gold if it's in your pocket essentially other than uh confiscation uh is in your pocket right you control it right it's a liability to no one um whereas you know bitcoin is is reliant on technology uh engaged you know run by other people um and so from the fundamental perspective there's a question and then it just comes down to the empirics and that's that's the point is if you're going to protect yourself from geo rising geopolitical tensions like one asset has millennia across geographies telling you how it performs and the other has you know nothing essentially no sample size no there is no sample size on bitcoin's performance in rising geopolitical tension and so if you're a saver you have to write recognize the uncertainty you don't know how it's going to perform in that environment because we we haven't observed it like your confidence just has to be very very low in terms of how it'll do it and the stress test that we saw in the last couple days was a fail
Stock Prices Remain High due to Earnings Expectations,2023-10-14 20:15:02+00:00,2,rL15j6ELpeI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL15j6ELpeI,like look stocks when you think about them particularly relative to bonds the current stock prices are are you know essentially you know in the last couple of years like bonds are down 50% long bonds are down 50% stocks are off a relatively modest amount the only way that that works is if people expect earnings to be a lot higher uh as a function of that and so i think there's a couple of different tri regulations here where the market pricing is certainly pointing us to a world where the people who are buying the marginal s&p 500 contract think that earnings like the only way to solve what why they're buying it is that they think that earnings are going to be more elevated than you know than uh are going to continue to grow at a relatively healthy clip yes you price first narrative second all always right i mean or or or you could just flip that around and say that they they don't care right i mean you know who who at vanguard is actually choosing to buy based on earnings expectations now that i agree with which is what non non-economic flows are what create market opportunities i totally agree with you on that right and so the question is that has now stretched to a point where what's implied is so extreme relative to what's likely to transpire from the economy perspective now of course in order for that to get realized you have to have people eventually arbit ring that flow which is and and that that is slower than it was 10 20 years ago but eventually you're going to have a situation where you know if earnings are consistently coming in below expectations below those elevated expectations you're going to have you know the closing of the gap between the elevated stock prices and the extremely depressed bond prices
Reasons We Are in a Late Cycle Environment,2023-10-14 12:15:01+00:00,4,H3nYx3_msN0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3nYx3_msN0,so you're in the late cycle camp bob it sounds like you and mike are in agreement on that um i mean what how could you not be in the late cycle not not to but how could you not be in how could you possibly argue that this is an early cycle environment right like unemployment is at secular lows right like the fed has tightened 500 basis points we've engaged in a qt program right like the idea that we're in an early cycle environment does not it is uh is only supported by a total ignorance and rejection of the basic macroeconomic facts that are at play so bob i uh actually on the margin i i agree with you both both of you uh but it's always possible you know for for the sake of argument uh fis fiscal stimul you know you'll be familiar with these arguments so you can just kind of whack them but uh you know fiscal stimulus now is so high that previous economic cycles doesn't matter the us consumer and businesses are much more s less sensitive to to interest rate hikes as you point out on twitter often bob we are in a secularly tight uh labor market so the peak unemployment rate in this cycle may be lower uh you know those are those are arguments sure and and i think i think in particular we saw a situation where there was weak weakening economic conditions particularly in the second half of last year um and you know i think mike was at the forefront of talking about how the economy was decelerating meaningfully at that time and what we saw what we saw was essentially a set of many fiscal stimulation miscal min fiscal stimuluses that none of which on their own were all that big a deal but you add them all up and actually we created an impulse particularly in january february march that then sort of flowed through to the rest of the economy but those things like the resetting of the tax brackets um some of the ira social security adjustment yep the social security adjustment those three things those are behind us not ahead of us we're not going to have a social security adjustment that looks anywhere near as positive as we saw in the 2023 the start of 2023 we're not going to see the tax bracket resetting be anywhere near as beneficial to households in terms of getting the the inry year tax cut in 2024 we're not going to see um the ira is behind us the the main stimulus effect of ira is behind us rather than ahead of us and so all of those things that created the sort of short you know we were on this weakening trajectory we had a short-term pop in the fiscal that created a bit of an extension of the cycle even to be honest relative to even what i thought was going to occur in terms of the duration of the expansion that stuff's behind us not ahead of us and that's really what and at the same time we've also had even though it's been less impactful than than we've had an expansion you know we had a rise in interest rates on the long end on the short end um all of those the glo you know global growth is weakening like all of the things that had been supports in early 2023 people are projecting will occur in 2024 and there's no there's no solid evidence that that will that will repeat in early 2024 the way it did in early 2023
History Proves Cycles Take Time,2023-10-13 20:15:02+00:00,3,lblPNz1fHlE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lblPNz1fHlE,what what are your economic views you've been an economic bull for you know as long as i've been following you how do you think the but recently i i noticed that you have some uh hints of pessimism in your in your economic outlook is is that accurate to say and what has changed my point about sort of economic bullishness was was less that we're going to experience a boom or we are experiencing a boom and more recognition that these sorts of like macro cycles just take a long time to play out and so when we were standing um when we were standing in april of you know 2022 and the tightening started you know the tightening was starting um you know the basic idea i was saying is like you know it's going to take a while and actually if you look at macroeconomic cycles over the course of the last let's say post-war cycles all the postwar cycles and you start with you know how much does the unemployment rate typically rise in the first 12 months after a yield curve inversion the answer is just a little like and what we've seen play out here in this dynamic is largely consistent with a typical macroeconomic uh cycle slowing the the times that start to get interesting is the subsequent year right at you know months 12 through 24 are a lot more interesting when it comes to what goes on and so the economy is has also been less sensitive to the tightening than even typic cycles as well and so what we're seeing is like just as basically everyone has given up on there being recession we're getting deeper into the late cycle of of the economy and i think while the rise in interest rates that happened more recently is not solely the reason why we're going to see a tipping of the economy it is a catalyst it may be a catalyst along with a number of other smaller fiscal contraction type things like student loans and some other stuff that just is just enough to kind of tip us into uh a a more significant weakening in the three six nine months ahead and so that's kind of the dynamic that we're seeing now and i'd say that i'd really contrast that you know my turn that a lot of people talked about was i was looking at atlanta fed gdp now at 6% and everyone's saying we'll never have you know essentially we'll never have another recession again and that is just you know that's just not the case and so part of the story when you're looking at financial markets is you have to bet relative to what expectations are and expectations still even today are extremely overweight softer no landing relative to the macroeconomic realities that are likely to play out
What Caused the Sell-Off in Bonds?,2023-10-13 12:15:04+00:00,3,To8C-pIYEJk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To8C-pIYEJk,what has caused this tremendous set off is it because of supply is it because inflation andor growth was higher than than expected well i think when you think about uh the long bond let's say 10year bonds it's really a combination of two different pieces which is um the impact of changes in expectations of monetary policy and we've gone through a few waves of this where uh you know the expectation has been repeatedly that the fed would quickly shift to cuts and that has not turned out to be the case um and we've sort of been in the last unwinding of that expectation for this last bond up move and remember when it comes to the volatility of bonds uh a fair amount of that volatility happens in the pricing of you know fed expectations over the course of the next couple years so that sort of recognition of the fed policy that's higher for longer drove it and then of course um there's the additional impact of the supply issues with which mike has discussed um where you know we've had you know the long end was reasonably suppressed because there wasn't a lot of bond supply both from the government related to the debt cealing issue and then the filling of the tga using bills really for the last nine months or so plus relatively subdued corporate supply in addition and so uh with a little bit of thawing of the corporate markets and uh the government now needing to issue longer duration to finance the relatively sizable deficits that's starting to impact the long end and and create a repricing there so i'd emphasize basically both of those issues are in some ways behind us rather than ahead of us given that we've had you know most of the cuts expected by the fed have been priced out uh for this most recent you know move uh upward in yields uh in the near term and then also the duration supply increase in duration supply is mostly happening now and i think is meaningfully in influenced the existing price um but on a forward-looking basis you know the the dynamics of the bond market and the complexion of it are going to be a little different than what we've seen uh over the last couple of months
What is Fair Value for a 10 Year Treasury?,2023-10-12 20:15:01+00:00,4,n98kTKZg8xM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n98kTKZg8xM,how high do you see that 10-year treasury yield going well i think we're we're we're basically in the ballpark here of of what fair value is on the tenyear treasury um you know we've gotten to a point where the rise in interest rates is significant enough to start to create that hit that drag on the economy uh and that drag on stock prices right and you could see that in the inm market action which is that you're starting to see stocks fall you know start see stocks fall meaningfully relative to bonds and a 5% yield you know over a long term you're starting to see uh term premiums in the bond market get up to the highest level that they've been you know post financial crisis and sort of at an average is level you know prior to the financial crisis and given the liquidity in the system and things like that uh and the high levels with that you wouldn't necessarily expect to have a circumstance where you' get to term premiums that are as extreme as they were say in the 90s and so you know on a value basis you know what i like i'd like to say like look the the the easy money has been made being short bonds like uh like maybe they'll go a little bit higher but like the story is that they needed to move to levels that are basically in this range to start to kick off the the slowing of the economy and the turning of the cycle and that's where we're at so so we talked we we spoke briefly about this before we went on the air about jamie diamond's comments regarding a 7% uh 10-year treasury yield and he had said it uh like you had brought up for the the banks to uh just to be prepared in the event that we do hit that do you think we' even come close to a 7% or is that just jamie diamond for crying out loud he's no macroeconomist hello well he's a banker though and he's a banker and i i think what he was saying which is which is prudent is that you should if you're sitting in the in the bank risk manager position you should be stress testing your book at a 7% yield because you know that is a totally plausible it's a plausible outcome i'm not saying that it's the likely outcome or where i think we're going but from a risk you know risk managers are paid to think about a wide range of plausible outcomes and making sure the bank doesn't blow up along the way and so you know you got to be thinking about what 7% could mean and so that's really i think what the way i take his uh his his advice i think the odds that we get into that range are not that high um and and the reason why that is is that would imply like a pretty extreme term premium on the long end you know hundreds of basis points of premium which um you know would be uh would would almost certainly start to create dip buyers into this mark into the bond market right yield buyers into the bond market the other thing i'd emphasize is if you get that i mean that's a 250 basis point move up in the bond yield think about what the impact the direct direct impact that will be on stocks right you're talking about a 25 30% even maybe more drag on on stocks and the point is that that then that create that shows the seeds of the reasons why it would not happen which is you start to get the stock selloff that we're seeing which starts to get people to look at the bond market as an attractive asset relative to the stocks which creates the bid out of you know the move out of stocks and into bonds and essentially puts the lid on the stock price at this uh term premium and so that's what you have to think about is that they intersect each other like asset prices in general might be too high but it's really stock prices are way too high and bonds are kind of in the ballpark at this point
Is a GDP Recession on the Horizon?,2023-10-12 12:15:03+00:00,5,lRJGCI-csAA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRJGCI-csAA,conditions are aligning for economic weakness and a recession dynamic to emerge in 2024 um just essentially as everyone's given up on it uh and certainly relative to expectations we're going to have a disappointing growth environment and i thought that and i was pretty compelled by it that before we had 100 basis point run up on the long end right and so what are we looking at you know what happens in typical recession environments well certainly you know zero earnings grow would be a great outcome in a recession environment and really what people should be looking at is uh the possibility of uh of meaningful negative earnings growth right and so your macro is recession recession of course yes yeah i mean i think that's like the probability of recession today is getting higher and higher just at a time when basically if we go back six or eight weeks ago everyone gave up on recession and to clear i'm not i haven't just been a bear through this whole time like if you go back a year or further i said that there was no chance that we were going to have a recession in in in the first part of 2023 because the cycle's much more slow moving than people expect and the and the economy is going to be a lot less sensitive to interest rates than people expect and what happened there was everyone thought there was a recession and then it didn't come which created right everyone was wrong about that and then what's happened you know more recently is everyone expects that things will be great just as the storm clouds are gathering for recession to play out in early 2024 and so you know the expectations are just totally wrong relative to understanding the fundamental macro dnamic that are happening in the economy yeah well i would i would agree with you on this and you know we've all talked about it we all sort of put our finger in there and saying omg is there anything of historical uh relevance now because everything is is different we we we're still pulling off pandemic money we're still you know we had all these various oneoff situations that change the playbook if you will if your playbook is that a recession is more likely than not going to happen in you know next year first half what's the strongest reason you'd say that we're going to have a you know a gdp recession well the the main thing is if you if you look at the um the combination b basically what you have is you have a circumstance where you've had a a massive tightening of interest rates right interest rates the short end has gone up the long end didn't comply now the long end's complying that's then creating a hit to to stocks as stocks fall the you know consumers will increase their savings rate reduce their demand we already saw that playing out in september in the timely credit card data even before the stock market dynamic that we've seen and that will then you know create a hit to first to the most cyclical sectors and then to the broader economy and the and and to earnings growth and as earnings growth fades then you get a weakening of labor market conditions and a softening of income like that you know in a lot of ways you say well we've never seen something like this a lot of us haven't seen a a cycle like this in our professional lifetimes but this cycle actually is very normal if anything it's like very common relative to what the cycles are that we've seen during our our professional lives like you know this is very much very akin to cycles in the 60s and the early 70s that's kind of what this looks like is like a traditional late cycle environment it just those cycles they just take a while to play out and the economy is just even less sensitive uh to the interest rate rises after the period of significant stimulation it's just you know but it's but it's normal like we're seeing a normal set of cyclical dynamics play out it's just that that people wanted it uh you know people wanted this recession like they want their amazon packages like it you know order at nine get it at two it's just like not how the economy works
Where will P/E Ratios Normalize?,2023-10-11 20:15:00+00:00,4,GpHIaze7wqA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpHIaze7wqA,yeah well i i think what we got to start to see is we got to start to see enough of a decline in stocks to start making that tradeoff between stocks and bonds make sense for investors and and when you're in a situation where um you know bond yields are are now in the five range right and earnings yields are in the five range and there's a meaningful risk that you're not gonna you're not going to meet uh those growth expectations that are priced into pees right right now you know if you look at analyst earnings expecting 12% earnings growth in 24 and then the same in 25 like that's a lot of earnings growth that is expected you know of course analysts are always a little too rosy but fine forget it call it 10 call it eight that's a lot of earnings growth in an environment where we're late cycle and bond yields just rose 100 basis points on the long end right like how are you going to get the economic growth that's going to be consistent with that sort of earnings growth in the future and so that's really what has to happen is we got to start to normalize those expectations we got to bring those pees back to something that's much more reasonable relative to that 5% bond yield and that's what creates the bottom in stock prices all right well two questions then number one i i'm sure you have a macro outlook so can you give us your macro outlook for you know north america if you will and then secondarily to normalize what what price earnings ratio what eps are you think would be back to normal since it's been abnormal for 12 years yeah well i i i think um maybe starting with the the the second question you know what is what is a normal bottoming look like in uh in pees right you've got to start to what are those what are those situations typically look like they look like um you know 10 12 15 pees they look like typically when you've gone through a recession you're looking at earnings compressing something like 15 20% in a in a sort of non- crisis earnings draw down and so you know what are we seeing here well right now what's priced in is earnings to go up 25% not down right and we're seeing pees you know that are coming down every day at this pace but still we're not quite in the range at the aggregate indices right at certainly small caps and and midcaps are are in the ballpark but the mega caps are not you know the the s&p 500 is not close to where we are so you know if we get uh a couple points more down on pees and we start to get those expectations of you know in line with actually some weakness in even zero right even zero earnings growth over the next couple years moving those expectations down that's when we start to talk about something that's a little more plausible and so you know moving equity the equity markets in this recession scenario moving into the you know deep into the 3000 range in the s&p 500 is totally totally plausible in fact it should be expected wow
How to Think About TIPS,2023-10-10 12:15:01+00:00,4,G1KRjP79Mmo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1KRjP79Mmo,bob if we look at um an interesting part of the fixed income market the so-called uh inflation protected market uh we already get questions on on that particular part of the market relative to our discussion on an inflationary environment with low growth so what do you make of the tips market as a diversifier or as an addition to a portfolio uh given your view of high inflation relative to growth here well first of all i love that we're having a conversation about tips i mean it doesn't get get any better than uh talking real interest rates it's not that's not the sort of usual conversation that uh that folks are are thinking about which is but it's good because you know i think let's first just talk about how you think about tips which i think is is important particularly in inflationary dynamic because i think a lot of people are sitting here looking at they're going w break even inflation is you know i don't know it's basically stuck at 2% you know so close to 2% and it's not really moving around despite the fact that we're getting this inflationary dynamic you know kind of how can that be and the answer is um if you've traded the tips market it's important that you to see that there's two ways an inflationary dynamic can resolve itself the first way is that break even inflation can rise uh and that's certainly one of the ways you know and and that mostly what you see is you see nominal yields rise more than you see real interest rates but the other way it can resolve it self particularly on the long end is that if there's expectations of elevated inflationary pressures over a long period of time what the way that that can get resolved is the central bank can respond through elevated real interest rates right so if you if if uh you can get that 2% inflation outcome uh that you know basically is being priced in the market as long as real interest rates are held higher for longer and that's essentially what we're seeing in this market is a real is a is a real circum irance where real interest rates have risen a lot you know the inflationary pressures have led to elevated real interest rates not really that elevated break evens and that those um those real interest rates i think reflect the reality that we probably need higher real rates for longer and that you know real rates let's be honest at you know in the mid tws in the in you know two and two and a quarter 250 like you know you're starting to get something that has real value in it um that you might not see in the nominals like if i you know just for perspective like the the greatest you know tips trade happened um right in the middle of the financial crisis and tips were at 325 so i mean that gives you a sense as to long data tips we're at 325 so you know we're not we've gone a long way from where we were in terms of you know tips being negative yielding to being yielding into the twos as you get up to the two and a half range like you know you start to get very attractive long longterm returns coming from those securities
How Are Markets Outside the U. S. Pricing Recession Risk?,2023-10-09 20:15:01+00:00,4,inu9sulOS0w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inu9sulOS0w,if we look at um price action but also um market pricing of recession risks outside of us borders um i'm talking in particular about european and chinese assets here um in case of such a say global recession scenario um is value to be found outside of the us europe well i think when you when you look across the the um the global economy uh and you look particularly about how assets are priced like let's let's be frank like you know us assets are priced you know i don't know 50 to 75% higher than they are in the rest of the world you know you look at equity yields what do you get like uh like the mg etf yield is something like % and what's your yield on us stocks you know four and a half something like that four and a half to five um you know that means that you know uh you got to believe that us equities are going to have radically better earnings growth you know in the medium term in order to to make the tradeoff to o overweight us stocks um to make sense and so you know i look at how are equity markets priced in china i mean they're quite you know real weak conditions are priced in china um you know may maybe things could be worse that's certainly possible but like you have a situation where you have uh you know p's that are running in the in you know 11 something like that and you have surveys that say that everyone you know every asset manager thinks that the chinese economy is never going to open up and never going to grow again um you know it's possible that that's the case it but the but the the trade-offs the skew is certainly a bit to the upside relative to that set of expectations and asset markets in sentiment and then europe you know i think the challenge with europe is the momentum's not great because the european economies are slowing down more you know particularly euro zone is slowing down more rapidly than in the us but it's also priced to be terrible um in terms you know you're getting pretty good yield uh or uk equities which are really global in nature but skewed to to the commodity um sector you're getting you know pees that are in again the low you know 11 12 something like that you know it could it could those uk listed companies could be a lot worse than than the ones in the us but you know all of those sort of speak to the fact that um us exceptionalism is priced into the market and the odds that us exceptionalism persists are not nearly as high as what's priced into the market that's all there is to it this has been a widow maker view over the past and i am i have traveled with such of you quite a few times uh as a salite strategist in banks and um i it it is a somehow easier view to take uh as on the cell side than on the buy side i think you agree with that like but i i perfectly agree with your assessment i i mean it it is evident that um the european economy is is priced for a much worse scenario than the us it is evident that the chinese economy is priced for a much worse scenario than the us the question is just whether you want to bet against the us anyway um and right now i'm i'm probably not willing to uh even though i i admit to uh the pricing being as you described it
Recession Expectations (as of Oct 2023),2023-10-09 12:15:06+00:00,3,fm0xB0876pM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm0xB0876pM,i uh i have to give you a hat tip up front for uh the way that you've um kept saying that the recession uh was not around the corner throughout the entire year uh you said it in early january when everyone uh and their mothers uh were stuck in recessionary discussions um and now i have the sense that you' have started to turn around a little bit on your view from a risk reward perspective bob am i right that you see a recession as a likelier scenario for 24 than you did earlier this year yeah well i think you know i think when we trade markets you know the basic the basic thing you got to start to think about is what um what is likely to happen relative to what's priced in and i think people too often forget the what's price priced in part of things you know you gotta you got to start with what's priced in and then you can go to what you think will transpire relative to that and i think what we're seeing you know what we saw at the beginning of the year was that basically everyone was pricing in the expectations of recession uh you know there were some models a year ago that said there was 100% probability of recession within a year which is kind of funny right since that didn't happen um and so you know that's the basic that's the basic dynamic that's been priced in you know that was priced in you know a year ago didn't transpire that's a big reason why asset prices actually did pretty well over the period well now you know i sort of uh when people were bandying about you know the atlanta fed gdp now measure of 6% and everyone was saying oh there's no way we're going to get into recession anytime soon you know that's exactly the time when you might start to ask questions about whether um whether there was you know whether we have uh uh the probability of a recession you know a year later with the tightening that we've had is certainly a lot a lot higher than zero uh and with the market you know the equity markets are pricing in 12% earnings growth next year and 133% earnings growth in the in the in 2025 you know that that's very high elevated earnings growth at a time when you know the inflationary pressures are emerging or sorry the the recessionary pressures are emerging the us economy is slowing down there's no question that there is some moderation in the us economy and you should expect that to continue further so it's really that gap between what's likely to transpire and expectations that's really the most interesting part of this overall dynamic
Stability and Low Inflation are No longer Guaranteed,2023-10-08 20:15:00+00:00,3,Hme42VpQy10,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hme42VpQy10,what do you think the macro environment is now and over the next you know three to five years what do you see happening based on your your experience and in your view of that where do you think things are heading well i think a lot of us you know in our professional careers kind of know one path which is low in flow stable inflation uh and stocks uh are are you know generally are going up quite well and in particular over the last 15 years of uniquely stimulative monitor ar policy and we've also learned that bonds are good diversifiers to stocks and that environment but all of that is very predicated on a secular decline in inflation and stability and i think we've we've really been you know many investors have been shocked over the course of the last 18 months finally recognizing that you know low and stable inflation is not a given in this world and certainly there are good macroeconomic reasons to think that the disinflationary dynamics that we've seen over the last 40 years are unlikely to persist in the future a lot of that a lot of those dynamics are reversing on a forward-looking basis you know we had a time of peace versus a time of war we had a time of global integration and now we're having a a time where where globally we're pulling back from each other right we're creating near shoring rather than international offshoring those sorts of dynamics are the things that created that that low inflation that we got used to that are reversing and so we're entering an environment of much higher inflation and where a lot of the dynamics the the lessons learned the rules of thumb that we've had that we've learned over the course of the last 40 years those things are no longer going to work in the future and so things like creating diversified portfolios um where you're considering what could happen if inflation is elevated for an extended period of time i think are the key uh the key dynamics the key things that investors need to start thinking about today in order to protect themselves from those environments because the the only the the the you know a growth slowdown weak growth and weak economic activity uh and falling stock prices isn't that bad if you could protect yourself again from that by holding bonds in your portfolio that's basically what you've been able to do the the terrible outcome the ruinous outcome for investors is environments where inflation is elevated and asset prices are returns are poor and the value of your money is deteriorating and that is that is a a a confluence of challenging conditions for investors and savers that we may be entering that we need to start to be prepared for

Central Bank Overview in Oct 2023,2023-10-07 20:15:00+00:00,5,Lrz6crgw8sU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrz6crgw8sU,i'd like to start with a brief summary of your takeaways from both the skip or pause from the federal reserve yesterday but also from the bank of england today what are the pros and cons of not doing anything here bob yeah well thanks so much for having me right here in the uh central bank bonanza i like to say here doesn't get more exciting than this for the uh for the macro set um you know i think what we're seeing at the big picture level sort of sort of known as we were coming into this was that um you know the the major developed world central banks are looking for a reason to pause um they really think that uh you know i think they're wrestling with the question of the tradeoff between weakening growth and inflation uh i think we were getting a good sense as to what their reaction function is and what their priorities are and the short of that in terms of their priorities is that they're willing to stop tightening before not just before it's certain that inflation's coming down to the mandate to their mandates but before it's even obvious that we're moving meaningfully in the right direction and so what we're seeing but you know a little less from the fed a little more from the bank of england the ecb uh and and some others is that um you know they're they're prioritizing their concerns about growth ahead of uh fulfilling their inflation mandate and are comfortable with a dynamic where you know even in the best of circumstances inflation is moving back down to mandate let's say in two years and they're okay with that so all that speaks to a set of central bank activities at least you know in the medium term let's call it three six nine months that are going to be comfortable with elevated inflationary dynamics in across these economies before we went on air here bob i um i made a heat map of forward pricing of all of the major central banks across the globe and over the next 12 months the bank of japan is the most hawkish prized central bank on earth then you know something is wrong right when's when's the last time that happened probably 1989 right yeah it's it's got to be decades back at least uh but if you look at the prospects for further rate hikes from the fed bank of england maybe even the ecb do you think there is a path ahead for them where they can actually decide on rate hikes again despite this paul retoric that they've used over the past couple of meetings here i i mean the short answer i think is no like i i don't think that those central banks in in a time frame that those of us who trade markets really care about are going to move to tighter monetary policy i think um you know they've they've basically uh made their bed when it comes to saying that they're you know at or maybe there's 25 base points more or something but i don't really care about that what we care about is are they going to meaningfully reenter a tightening cycle anytime soon i think the answer is no they think they've done enough and frankly they're making a big bet on the fact that the disinflationary forces and the work that they've done so far will eventually get inflation back down to their mandate now i think the thing that's interesting about that from a traders perspective is what that does is it puts a lot more weight on the long end of the curve and that's exactly what we're seeing typically if you were uh you know if you go back to the 07 cycle or the the 2000 cycle when the when the central bank stops tightening when you get that pause that would typically be a good indication to buy bonds right because the central bank is no longer essentially dragging up the yield curve with their activities but as we've learned in the last couple of days it's exactly the opposite right uh bonds have been selling off despite the fact that these central banks have paused and even in some cases sort of doish paused relative to expectations and the reason why that is is because the fact that they've paused before we've meaningfully gotten inflation down to mandate or close to mandate means that the inflation problem still exists right the risk of the inflation problem still exists and what that means is that the long end is repricing that dynamic like the worst thing for the long end today is that central banks don't tighten a aggressively and the best thing is that they do and that's a little counterintuitive but you can see it in the market action that's the reality of what we're seeing and so you know it's up to the long end and the market base tightening to get the job done right now
What is a Macro Framework for Investing?,2023-10-07 12:15:01+00:00,3,AZ_mxphwUXI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ_mxphwUXI,let's hear a little bit about like what's your framework how you approach thinking about the world yeah i mean my my career i've been a systematic investor for a couple of decades now and in particular a systematic macro investor and so when i think about how the world is working i'm i'm basically going back to sort of core cause effect relationships understanding those cause effect relationships and from there putting into context essentially all the things that are going on into what those normal relationships are and then from there trying to you know predict what's going to happen and then compare that to what's priced into asset markets and that obviously creates the opportunity for alpha or or new opportunities and and you know really at that at the core of that is thinking about basically where we are in a cyclical dynamic at any point in time which you know business cycles they come they go they go up they go down each one's a little different but there's a lot of commonalities between those and then putting that in the context of more secular dynamics like deb cycles like you know globalization de globalization things like that that sort of are uh underlying or or or underlying all of those sort of cyclical dynamics that we're seeing in a day-to-day basis and so you know when i look at the world today it is in some ways feels very new and different than what we that many investors have experienced which is you know an inflationary business cycle in the context of you know the end of the long-term debt cycle and in the context of a shift from globalization to deglobalization but those sorts of dynamics they've existed plenty of times in history just not in our professional careers most of our professional careers and so when i'm thinking about what's going on i'm thinking about turning my attention and thinking about those other previous cases where we saw this sort of confluence of events where you saw an inflationary business cycle where you saw you know de globalization dynamics where you saw you know geopolitical tensions things like that obviously the 70s are are relevant but there's also you know a dash of the 2000 cycle in terms of uh the busting of a of a bubble you know our bubble in the last 15 years is more like an everything bubble that was more a tech bubble some flavor of the 70s and maybe a a little bit of flavor of you know back in the de globalization dynamics that happened you know after the the first world war so it's kind of kind of see the combination of all those different things happening at the same time and you know this cycle will be some combination of all of those things intersecting with each other and and leading to what what transpires
Gold is Different than Other Investments,2023-10-06 20:15:00+00:00,6,RCIjVFUNAeE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCIjVFUNAeE,what kind of role does gold play in an investment portfolio yeah well i think you know gold's role and the first thing it says gold we've gotten you know 5 000 years of history in terms of uh you know the role of gold or to see and understand how gold functions as a financial asset and i think that's an important thing because you know gold is different from extractive commodities you know which have like productive value or um or stocks or bonds that have a clear uh you know have a clear reason why they would have yield over time right so somewhat of a fundamental valuation that can be thought of relative to the cash flows that they'll produce you know gold's different of course because it it has de minimis uh industrial value and also offers no yields so you put that together and that's a very interesting asset and so you really you do have to understand it in the context like like how gold works and how gold functions and and performs as a as a financial asset um is a matter of psychology like that's very interesting like a very interesting thing thing to think about that it is a matter of psychology like it's not a matter of fundamentals it's a matter of psychology so you have to understand the psychology and the psychology basically holds in a couple different ways first of all gold serves as a contra currency um and what i mean by that is that um you know uh paper currency uh has a certain value uh that's ex that's expected over time and gold is a is a contra contra to that in the sense of uh it is an alternative currency that you can hold your assets in um that is you know widely accepted in the sense of you know everyone in the world people buy gold in all sorts of different ways um and has been accepted throughout history and so whenever you're thinking about gold you're you know it's important to think about it like i could either choose yielding paper currency right or i can choose non-yielding gold and what you see is in times when people start to raise questions about the value of paper currency you often see gold outperform paper current see and the other thing is at times when you see interest rates uh rise on paper currency you typically see gold underperformed yep right because one has yield and one doesn't and that's just a natural trade-off and so i think you want to think about it with those fundamental dynamics and in that context it allows you to start to think about okay what are the circumstances the outlier circumstances um the unusual circumstances where uh you'd expect to see gold do well and that's you know places where you have to have meaningful currency devaluations like interesting in china today just as a simple example in an environment where there's meaningful capital controls right what are they doing they're going to buy gold and golds trading at like an eight percent premium in shanghai over what its price is in london you know that's in that you know it may be a pet rock uh but you know it's a pet rock that all of humanity across cultures has largely identified as being the pet rock you want when you want to to be able to store you know have a store hold it well yeah and so that's a good example there's also a situation where let's say you think that there's a risk of a meaningful easing of monetary policy an unreasonable easing of monetary policy let's say um because you know let's say central banks haven't beaten back the inflation dynamic even though they're starting to shift their interest rate policy that could be a good time for gold because it's a circumstance where the value of paper money versus stuff is starting to get depreciated and you see a circumstance where yields are starting to compress those two things set themselves up for actually quite a good circumstance for gold and so you want to think about it from those fundamental perspectives and i think what you'll find if you look through time is that um is that gold is a pretty good diversifying asset in a lot of circumstances you know as a simple example if you go back and look through time uh in terms of like rolling 12-month periods where u.s equities have been down over the last 75 years gold is outperformed bonds and more than 50 percent of those circumstances okay well you know like it you know and then you just compare that and you just say oh that's empirical evidence and i could i could go show that to you across developed countries i could show you across the merchant countries it's a little better for emerging countries because of the contra currency stuff but you put that all together and then you say okay so how much gold do you have in your portfolio and someone's like no none because you'd be a crazy person to hold gold because only weirdos hold gold and i'm sitting there going like what like like you know i i know you know living in a bunker gold bug i'm just looking at the empirical evidence and i'm like well you know this seems as good as the diversifier as bonds are so like maybe i should just kind of hold them in an equal weight um but yet that's like a radical difference like everyone in the world is overweight bonds and basically no one holds gold um even though the empirical evidence would suggest that there's like very good reason why you'd want to hold gold uh over you know over uh long time frames
Central Banks Face Challenging Circumstances,2023-10-06 12:15:02+00:00,5,GAzMaKN5CW8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAzMaKN5CW8,know central banks face a pretty challenging circumstance right now because in a lot of ways the restructuring of of economies following the financial crisis have really sort of uh changed their tool kit and the uh effectiveness of their toolkit uh in terms of you know rate rises and even asset price moves to shifts in demand and you know nominal incomes and with it nominal spending and inflation and so um so they're they're positioned or the structurally like we we haven't seen a real down cycle in 15 years because covert was kind of like you know a little bit of you know i i it was an external shock more than it was a cycle right it wasn't really the cycle it was uh you know it was a it was a crisis a sort of shock situation and so given it's been 15 years and given the entire economy has basically been re-structured since coved or since the great uh the gfc um that uncertainty means that uh you know they they don't really necessarily know exactly what they need to do to achieve their goals right and i think often people will say well i think maybe they're just not achieving you know they've they've given up on their goals or you know the fed is you know fine with higher inflation and there's some sort of you know conspiratorial uh view that you know central bankers are trying to like structurally uh inflate away the debt and fund the government stuff like that i don't think that that's right like this is more a story of um you know that would suggest uh that there was um that there was uh planfulness that they there was a design for for uh the challenging outcomes that they've seen i think it's more a matter of incompetence not you know not not judgmental and confidence just like they have not been competent to be able to achieve the the goals that they've set forth um and and so in that in that context i think what we see a lot of these folks is they've really gone and leaned on the one lever that they feel like they know that's more you know been used for 40 years which is interest rate ike's only to find those to be like not that effective um in getting done what they need to get done and for uh for a number of fundamental reasons why that is uh in terms of you know restructuring debt in the economy and terming it out and fix you know low fixed borrowings and mortgages and by corporations and you know the the funny thing is that they've sort of stepped away from using a lever that actually proves pretty effective in the 2010s not perfect but pretty effective which was the use of quantitative easing or tightening you know which is just the flip side of it and they've kind of given up you know basically everyone has given up on qt as a lever the fed really hasn't changed its view on qt in a long time um and that's surprising to me because when i think about you know the ocean is too hot right inflation is is too high relative to mandate that's the basic issue we quibble about the nuances of that um you know the price of credit is not really the problem in the us economy like it costs a lot to borrow you know they look pretty radically changed mortgage prices car loan prices all that stuff the problem is that people aren't borrowing at those elevated rates right because they don't have to borrow at those elevated rates because their asset prices are so elevated that they can basically sell assets to buy the things that they want you know essentially pay all cash for houses um or all cash for cars uh because asset prices are elevated and quantitative tightening is the most effective lever to uh to influence asset prices right because all quantitative trading is selling assets and so yeah the central bank sells assets that should hurt asset prices and it should help deal with this problem which is really not a price of credit problem that's been repriced but a price of assets problem that continues to keep the economy going at a level and rate that is too hot relative to the to the mandate

How do you resolve the Gap Between Wages and Productivity?,2023-10-04 20:15:00+00:00,5,3uqGKYIf3X0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uqGKYIf3X0,the rate of growth in wages has been um has kind of been upward sloping over kind of the last say 18 months um and so is you know is that kind of the key variable here where you know you could have you know you could have a tight um you know labor supply but at the same time you know if wage if wagees start to come down or wage growth start to normalize quite a bit you know we would start to see inflation come down is that is that kind of the way you're thinking about it or you know what what are what are kind of your thoughts on inflation and the labor market here yeah well i mean first of all whenever you when you're thinking about inflation there's basically uh there's two things that matter probably more than anything um again just going to like this like break it down into some simple like un you know digestible understandable pieces you know inflation is basically oil which per you know permeates everything that goes on in the economy and then the other piece is um essentially how much uh money people are earning relative to how much they're producing right because you think about oil is sort of an uh whatever an elastic input oil comes in you got to pay for it because you need the energy and when i say oil what i mean is like you could kind of think more broadly about commodities weighted by the by the needed demand for the economy or whatever um and so you kind of think about it that way and when it comes to to wages um i i describe it in that context of nominal wage growth relative to productivity growth because i think that's a really important way to think about it because um what that helps you understand is how much are people how much are people's pay get is getting increased on a you know on an annual basis relative to how much more are they producing and so if you know i i think the uk is a good example where wages are growing at almost 8% nominally per year and then you turn over and you look at productivity and you're like well the productivity is zero okay well so how does that how does that resolve it itself like you know you can't just have more more income into the system and no more stuff and expect prices to be the same now of course part of that could part of that excess income relative to productivity growth could flow into financial assets it could you know could could meet or could resolve in um in greater financial savings right and then support financial asset prices um but particularly as you as you think about that sort of equation for a lower income cohort right those that are primarily not saving meaningful portions of their income like basically what happens is they earn an income and they spend it right and so if you can understand that imbalance between the growth and what they're getting paid and the income uh that they're and the income or and the and the amount that they're producing that essentially gives you an indication of what structural inflationary pressures exist in the economy and this isn't a black and white idea you know it's not and and there's all sorts of measurement you know ambiguity so let's not like try and overdo it but i think this basic idea right now which is like look people's pay is rising pretty fast uh you know faster than it has in a long time and the efficiency with which people are producing you know goods and services is uh you know is weak relative to history and so it's not surprising that we're getting this structural inflationary pressure how does that get resolved well it can get resolved um through either productivity improving which you know on a structural basis doesn't really change very fast like even the advent of the personal computer which is probably the biggest you know productivity impulse in the last 50 years it took kind of like 15 years to matter you know to to be you know meaningful right um so that's probably not you know it's not going to change in the in in the um in the short term but what can change i should say structural productivity doesn't change in the short term what can change is basically two things you can loosen the labor market which causes wages typically to moderate right because as labor markets loosen people's wage income you'd expect to slow the other thing you can do which is you know important and basically how this gets resolved in most cycles is ausing of the labor market typically enhances productivity and the reason why that is is that the people who are hired at last in the cycle and the people who are fired first in the cycle are typically the lowest productivity employees and that makes sense right you would you try and find the best employees that you can to start and then over time you find whoever you can who's still unemployed come into the labor market and so that sort of tactically is how or i'd say cyclically is how this imbalance gets resolved and so that's the most likely resolution here is that you know there'll be sufficient slowing of economic activity that will create a moderation in the labor markets that will both improve productivity and also bring wages down and so that's how it gets resolved
Formative Career Lessons in Macro and Systemization,2023-10-03 20:15:00+00:00,7,mDmtOkPjuLA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDmtOkPjuLA,you know i learned a lot about how uh to to think rigorously about um macro about markets and about how to develop systematic approaches and i think um you know i think the couple of key sort of uh lessons experiences skills maybe you might even say that i learned was really a com really i say first um this idea of thinking uh from the big picture all the way down to the practical reality and all the way back up and having to make sure that those things all intersect with each other very well i think that's um often you'll meet people who might be particularly good at the big picture or particularly good at sort of the details of analysis and that in order to really understand how things work you really have to work at all those levels uh which is which is important push yourself to work at all those levels i think the other thing it was really critical to develop a skill set around was was this idea of systemization which you know systemization you start to talk about and people's eyes you know sort of glaze over and they think you're just talking about a black box scenario and i think um particularly also as people talk more about ai today and then that's like even more black boxy like what the heck is all this and um i think it was really a great environment to develop an appreciation for the fact that there's a set of there's a set of tools that are out there like ai machine learning regression whatever all these different tools random forests there's a bunch of different tools uh that you can use that are that are quantitative techniques to help you express an intuitive or fundamental understanding express and measure intuitive and fundamental understanding but the way that that works at least at least as it works for macro is that the direction has to be from the intuitive understanding to the use of the tools to then the outcomes and then trading markets that's a very it's very important to think in that direction too often i see folks who are very deeply uh deeply skilled in the techniques trying to go back to the intuition and that doesn't work and the reason why that is particularly in macro investing is because there isn't enough sample size to be able to really operate in a way where you can sort of use the techniques to infer the re infer the understanding um because the the techniques you know many of these techniques require a level of sample size to build their inferences that is you know we've had seven macro cycles since the since 1945 or whatever like that you know that's literally seven data points you know seven data points isn't going to get it done um and so really understanding and appreciating where are those tools effective you know very you know uh uh many sort of machine learning models are very effective in say short-term individual security trading with a time frame of one day that's a very you know you know because you have incredible sample size to infer from there um and incredible ability to bet on a lot of different outcomes but definitely doesn't work as a solution to certain other problems like you know is the yield curve inversion does that indicate a recession and if it does over what time frame like that is that is you know not a very good use of those sorts of techniques so a lot of that there was a lot of building that suite of understanding and tool kit that i can then apply in a bunch of different ways uh as you know as as uh as as i'm doing what i'm doing now so so when you say you know you go from kind of the intuitive understanding so with that would so you know would that be for example saying you know um you know bonds or you know so or in our state are kind of a safe asset so therefore in kind of a bear market you know generally speaking you know in a bear market bond should do well then after that trying to see how bonds behave in a bit right right that's yeah that's a that's a simple uh you know i i always like to say well you know um uh if inflation expectations rise relative to what people had had initially expected generally bonds will sell off and why is that because bonds you know the interest rate of bonds is reflective of accommodation of what people expect on the real yield rel plus what they expect to get paid for inflation over time and so like that's a that's a fundamental that's a sort of a simple fundamental understanding intuitive understanding of how the world works and then you can go back and you can say is that simple intuitive understanding true or not true right is it you know does it work that way um you know in in all environments in some environments right and start to build that sort of and then and then the question inevitably comes okay so i just said that and you're like okay yeah if inflation is above expectations bonds sell off but um but like what does that actually mean in terms of how do you go execute that how do you measure that how do you figure out what's priced in like you know this is not a trivial exercise yeah but it starts with the intuition and then goes in that direction and i think in particular this environment has been really important to force people to start with the intuition and start with the fun i'd say i call this the fundamental intuition and then have to go and and then go and measure those dynamics i think like you know guild curve inversion such a good example like everyone you know how many people were like well the old girl's inverted recession is now and it's like hold on hold on hold on let's let's re you know that's a good example of observing and infern you know observing and intuiting right rather than saying okay well let's talk about what are the fundamental drivers the intuitive fundamental drivers of how um of how you know the macro economy works and how does the yield curve fit into that is it a reflection of the fundamental dynamics it is it is it a indicator of what's likely to transpire in certain ways is it a reflection of market pricing is it a reflection of supply and demand imbalances like all of those things are the fundamentals that you have to understand you can't just sort of use the indicator and go back and say well obviously this is just how it works is you know

Holding Cash vs Holding Assets?,2023-10-03 12:15:02+00:00,3,_1CtndikdQQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1CtndikdQQ,is that many folks i'm sure who are joining us here today are wrestling with this basic question of do you hold cash or do you hold assets so when i say assets what i mean is you know a traditional long only 60 40 portfolio but also thinking about do you hold a portfolio of active management in addition uh to holding cash now of course cash in this sort of environment feels very safe right you get your five and a half percent yield and the risk that you have from a price perspective is relatively muted and so the penalty it seems the feel of the penalty of cash no longer seems as extreme as it has been in the past but i think it's important to recognize that there really is a cost of holding cash and what that cost is is the the trade-off between holding cash and holding assets and typically you should expect assets to outperform cash over time and this is a very simple reason why that is why would you ever put why would anyone give money to asset holders or asset issuers if uh they didn't get a higher expected return on their investment than simply holding cash and so what we're seeing here today if you look through time what what it shows is that what we've seen over the last 12 or 18 months is actually a pretty unusual outcome which uh the chart here that i'm showing uh show gives some perspective on the performance of cash relative to assets through time with assets uh showing when they outperform in the blue and when cash outperforms in the gold and what you see is that over these rolling 12-month periods there's the vast majority of the time uh you see assets outperform cash and that inevitably leads to the question which many folks are wrestling with today which is basically do you think about timing this right because obviously if you could figure out a way way to be in cash when it outperforms and in assets when they outperform that would be the ideal strategy for you right but the challenge with that is you've got to figure out when this out this relative performance works in your favor either towards assets or towards cash
Are Markets Set Up for a Surprise?,2023-10-02 20:15:00+00:00,4,h9a03vOZNAM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9a03vOZNAM,are you long-term short-term what are you looking when we see opportunities at right now yeah well i think it's going to be a pretty tough time for a lot of investors because um we're kind of in many ways going back to a bit of the dynamic that we saw in 2022 which is an environment where maybe both stocks and bonds don't do very well right that was an outlier that was one of the worst years for 64 to the last century that was like that's right it was a real surprise yes in terms of the magnitude of the tightening people were very much taken by surprise on that and i think the problems were start were set up for a similar style surprise in late 23 and early 24 and that's because you have so much strong so much expectations of earnings growth in the stock market that will be challenging to achieve yeah and at the same time you already have interest rate cuts priced into the bond market given uh the the the the meaningfully inverted yield curve and so it's easy it's easy to have disappointment on both fronts yeah right where stocks don't you know earnings don't come in like extra expectations and the fed doesn't cut quite as fast as people expect i think the one area that's a bit mispriced and uh we're seeing it pricing over and over again more and more is the commodity complex right which has been very soft uh you know for for much of the year where you know you get a little bit a little bit of tightening in the commodity complex you start to get those prices to rise and if anything that's the thing that will really hurt the 60 40 in addition because it just makes the feds dynamics more challenging so you put that together you know 60 40 very tough environment for 60 40. so you got to look outside that whether it's to commodities gold and and maybe alpha right looking for active management to help navigate through this challenging market environment i agree with commodities i mean i i i'm underexposed personally but i think there's some great opportunity there and you look at like copper for example i mean the amount of copper has been needed for renewable energy electric vehicles it's just the supply is not there that's right you do the math and tactically what you're seeing is those markets aren't tight or in tight supply you're seeing inventories being drawn down so you're really you are seeing sort of tactical dynamics that look good for those markets at the time when you're also seeing this more strategic environments that are positive for the commodity yeah i think it's just patience yeah you had to sit on those and let that play out that's right like anything it's about creating a diversified set of positions and particularly looking for things that maybe they're not sure sure things but they're sort of tilted and skewed in your in your direction particularly in the event you know that you try and get a couple of bets that are on both sides of whether growth is better than outcome expectations are worse than expectations and so that's why i kind of like you know the long commodity positions with maybe uh underweight stocks underweight bonds um because the economy does well copper is going to do well exactly exactly so you want to you want to just really find those sort of those lowly correlated or zero correlated positions and and where you just have a little bit of edge where it's more likely not that it goes in your
Where is the Risk in a 60/40 Portfolio?,2023-10-02 12:15:05+00:00,2,j4o_STricMY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4o_STricMY,really really what like what is 60 40. i mean 60 40 95 of the risk in 60 40 is driven by equities yeah like that that's what like like 60 40 is equities for the long one and like equities for the long run can have extraordinary drawdowns you know 15 20-year uh real return drawdowns right and so um and so that's why 60 you know what is prosperity i mean like the construction is such that there's effective you know there's effectively levering of the bonds in order to make them risk match to things like gold and commodities and equities but it's not really levered in that sense it's you know if anything it's just basically saying well instead of just holding equity risk hold equity bond commodity and gold risk and a little bit of credit risk but mostly it's just holding those four risks and you're gonna be better off holding those four risks rather than just holding effectively one risk right that's basically all it is um and you can and you get a you get a sense as to how it how it does which is it's true in extreme tightening environments risk parity doesn't do well but to be clear bonds don't do well and stocks typically don't do well during those periods right and so the question is really how do you create that that consistent return of assets relative to cash and it's by making that asset portfolio as well structured as you can
The Beginning of a Year-End Selloff?,2023-10-01 20:15:03+00:00,2,bUnV6M2yuDY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUnV6M2yuDY,just wondering if we're seeing the beginning of a yearend selloff right here uh with the price of oil a challenge also spiking interest rat let's take a look at the 10 year right now the 10e is close to 5% again and that's giving people an opportunity to say okay maybe i don't want to have all my money in stocks maybe i do need to go for some yield in fixed income is that what you're doing yeah that's that's exactly right if you think about it uh look over the course of the third quarter uh you know stocks have basically been flat and long and bonds have sold out 15% right what an what an extreme revaluation that we've seen between those two assets over the course of just a couple of months that's going to put pressure on folks to rebalance out of stocks move into bonds take advantage of those higher yields not to mention the fact that you still have this tightening effect that that could still continue to affect the equity market very challenging time for st tenure now 4.64 7% it's up three and a half basis points this morning where does this go what what what what are you looking for in terms of this this move well how how much higher can it go well it could it could certainly keep going higher you still have cuts priced in uh a little later into 24 those could come out which could raise the the bond yeld but the reality is the easy money has been made in bonds right the real question is look over at the stock market stocks have outperformed long-end bonds by nearly 60% over the last couple of years that's unsustainable in an environment where we're getting late cycle where we have these pressures on growth not to mention all the tactical stuff about a government shutdown strikes etc that you were talking about earlier
Late Cycle Market Dynamics,2023-10-01 12:15:07+00:00,2,zeyPBXQwQi8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyPBXQwQi8,bob you say we're late cycle recessions right around the corner so encyclicals are weakening so conventional wisdom would say late cycle you buy what utilities materials industrials that kind of thing and utilities is one of the weakest sectors in q3 down nine percent alongside real estate is there opportunity there well you've got a basic situation where those long end yields rising are affecting uh those those uh those cash flows right much in the way of you know real estate affected by the long bond as well as utilities affected by bond bond yields as well i think what it highlights is this overall market dynamic where we're where most of the easy money has being short bonds has been made and now the question is what asset in that market looks overvalued right now it sure isn't bonds right it's stocks which over the last couple of years are up 60 percent relative to long bonds right long bonds are down 50 stocks are doing pretty well holding up that's the big discount that's the big divergence in the market that eventually that has to get closed that's that dynamic is going to get closed and is economic momentum deteriorates that's only going to get moved faster uh to closing in in the fourth quarter
