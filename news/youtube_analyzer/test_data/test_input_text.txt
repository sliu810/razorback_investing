"Hey everybody. Welcome back to Chip Stock\nInvestor quick update on micron. The market has been finishing out\nthe year very strong, but micron is trying to bring us all down. Yeah, of course. Wednesday, we got the market sell off\non the fed indicating maybe it will be lowering interest rates a bit more\ngradually than what everyone was hoping for still 2024 has been a good year. We closed out the year in grand fashion. Micron, though, uh, let's talk about this. Perhaps you're familiar with our\nsemiconductor industry, a flow chart that we've been sharing now for\ngosh, two years, almost two years. Uh, we have our 2025 refresh\non this coming out very soon before the end of 2025. Micron of course, is an IDM,\nintegrated device manufacturer. They design and manufacture\nall things memory chips. Before we dive into the nitty gritty\ndetails, just want to remind our viewers that we have a membership Semiconductor\nInsider, especially as we're going into 2025, we're going to be releasing some\nnew content exclusive to our members. You can join now before the end of 2024, for just 5 a month. In 2025, that membership price goes up. Let's jump back in time just a few months\nto Micron's outlook that they provided for memory chips, DRAM chips specifically. They said that in 2024, the\ndemand outlook improved because of that strength in data centers. And in calendar year 2025, Micron said\nDRAM and NAND industry bit demand growth to be around mid teens percentage. Okay, three months later, here's the most\nrecent outlook for memory chip demand. This was for the Q1 fiscal year 2025\nquarterly update that just came out. DRAM growth still expected to be in the\nhigh teens percentage range for this year. And mid teens percentage for 2025. That's good news. A lot of this is being driven by that\nHBM, high bandwidth memory, which are essentially just stacks of DRAM\nchips on top of each other to help with AI and accelerated computing\ninfrastructure from NVIDIA, of course. So that outlook is just fine, but\nhere's where the market maybe, I guess, got thrown a curve ball. NAND bit demand growth for\n2024 and 2025 is now a bit lower than prior expectations. A lot of this is being driven by\nslower recovery in consumer devices. Especially PCs, laptops, and\nsmartphones, and ongoing inventory adjustments for those end markets. Kasey,  it's, it's almost like everybody\nforgot Micron does a lot of other memory chip supply outside of AI. That's exactly what happened. Okay. Anyways, we're going to come\nback to that in just a moment. Uh, in green though, there at the bottom,\nthere's a bit of a call out for one of your top picks from this past year, right? Okay. Yes, absolutely. Micron said that we should expect\nhigh capacity NAND solid state drives to start displacing capacity hard\ndisk drives in the data center. What does that mean exactly? If you haven't caught it yet, check\nout our video on pure storage that we did recently, because Pure Storage\nand Kioxi are collaborating to help a hyperscaler get NAND flash\nmemories in their data centers. Historically, hard disk drives have been\nthe lifeblood of memory in data centers, but there is going to be some push towards\nthese flash drives, which is a big deal. And who is that Pure Storage\nhyperscaler customer? Uh, over on Semiconductor Insider,\nwe've had some discussion on this. It seems like a lot of folks over\nthere think it could be Oracle. Oracle, of course, making a big\npush into the data center race. Seems like a pretty\nsolid conjecture to us. It could also be Microsoft Azure,\nAlphabet's Google Cloud, Amazon AWS. We don't know, but the point is,\nlots of demand for NAND chips. However, and this is important, Micron\nand the other memory chip suppliers have a lot of other end markets besides just\ndata centers and especially those AI and accelerated computing data centers\nand that is what caused downbeat mood on Micron stock following this latest update. Kasey, break it down for us everything\nother than accelerated computing and AI. Yes all of these other\nmarkets have been in a slump. We expect that consumer and\ncloud and enterprise are at the start of a new growth cycle. Auto and industrial is\nstill at the bottom. So all of those markets, we\nwould have really liked a sharper recovery, but we're actually just\nseeing more of a U shaped recovery. It's just taking much longer\nfor those cycles to end their slump and get into a recovery. Yeah. And specifically for Micron, we'll show\nyou their guidance for their next quarter Q2, fiscal 2025, which corresponds\nroughly with the beginning of calendar year 2025, they said some of the consumer\nproducts had a big inventory correction. It sounds like in particular. Maybe the ramp up of these new\nPC and laptop AI specific models. Think like Qualcomm's new Snapdragon\nX Elite powered devices, these AI PCs as Microsoft is calling them,\nmaybe not selling as quickly as what Micron had previously been expecting. So a little bit of an\ninventory correction there. Micron said it should be temporary,\nand growth should resume later in 2025. Before we get to that outlook though, and\nour assumptions for Micron in this next year, let's go back to the CAPEX guidance,\ncapital expenditures that's spending on property, plant, and equipment, and\nespecially equipment, manufacturing equipment, on companies like Lam Research. Again, this was their Q4 fiscal year\n2024 outlook, 2025 capex they said would be meaningfully higher and at around\nthe mid 30 percent range of revenue. You can see we broke that down in fiscal\nyear 2024, capex to revenue was 32%. Here's the update that they provided here\nin Q1, they expect in fiscal Q2, CapEx to be around $3 billion, and they expect to\nspend about 14 billion in 2025 overall. And that definitely will put\nMicron in that mid 30 percent range of CapEx to revenue. And remember, this is a big jump in CapEx\nbecause Micron's revenue is still growing, quite dramatically on a year over year\nbasis as they come out of the bear market. And so the Microns hiccup here in\nthis last quarter with the stock, as well as woes over Intel, which have\nbeen well documented and in general, just slow manufacturing activity has\na lot of investors worried about in particular, the health of the fab five, including LAM Research, which\nhistorically is one of the biggest manufacturing equipment suppliers\nfor memory chip makers like Micron. The point is here though folks,\nMicron, yes, some of their revenue recovery has stalled out just a bit. But that CapEx spend still has to go\nin place, especially as Micron starts building those new facilities that\nthey got US Chip's Act awards for like the facilities in upstate New York. So overall, a lot of bumpiness\nin the market right now, a lot of uncertainty, but we think the fab five. And Lam Research in particular, our\npick for playing the memory market recovery are going to be just fine. Here is Micron by the\nnumbers for this quarter. We'll key in on revenue. Revenue is $8. 7 billion. And then also look at that\nearnings per share at a dollar and 79 cents earnings per share. Now let's take a look\nat the Q2 2025 guidance. You can see revenue is\ngoing to drop down to $7. 9 billion at the midpoint in earnings per\nshare, right around a dollar and 43 cents. So a sequential decline, not\nwhat the market was expecting. Kasey, is this seasonality\nor what's up with this? This, this really doesn't look good\nwhen we were expecting a big upcoming 2025 for the memory chip market\ndriven by all of that AI demand. What happened? Yes, part of it is seasonality however,\nas you mentioned earlier, a big part of Micron's business is not focused on AI. It's focused on those other\nend markets, which are again, just coming out of a slump. Yeah. Okay. So slower recovery expected. Micron's commentary sounded like maybe\nby Q3 of their fiscal year 2025, they'll be back in sequential growth mode again. We'll monitor the situation. Of course, we'll be talking about this. Micron is a pretty good proxy\nfor the overall health of the semiconductor industry. One question that continuously comes\nup over on Semiconductor Insider, though, is eventually with all of this\ndemand for high bandwidth memory, HBM, lots of AI and accelerated computing. Surely Micron and the other memory chip\nmakers like Samsung and SK Hynix mentioned Kioxia's deal with Pure Storage earlier. They just had an IPO in\nJapan that went pretty well. Surely, AI means less\ncyclicality for Micron. The answer is absolutely no. They are going to remain one of the\nmost volatile and cyclical businesses. And we're not talking about\nthe stock price either. When we talk about cyclicality and\nthese end market cycles, we're talking about revenue and profitability. So you can see in this chart over the\nlast decade, lots of ups and downs. We're still headed towards new record\nhighs for Micron, but just, just be careful folks, because this is going to\nbe a vicious cycle, even with a high, it's not going to just simply go away. If we keep waving that magic\nAI wand around furiously. There's no expunging this fact, Micron\nis a simple ingredients producer that companies like Pure Storage or\na smartphone manufacturer or a PC manufacturer or a data center operator. They buy those ingredients from\nMicron to cook up the final dish. Micron is always going to be a highly\ncyclical business because of that relationship and because of the fact\nthat they, they ultimately sell a basic ingredient, a basic commodity. Even if that commodity might be\nsuper, super advanced, this chart will always look like six flags, Colossus\nrollercoaster, as will this next chart. Kasey I don't even know that we\nwant to even show this chart because it's almost completely worthless,\nespecially at this point, but this is another thing we get, like. Micron stock is super cheap, that\nmakes it an automatic buy, right? Yeah, this chart is pretty ugly. It's hard to interpret. It's kind of like looking at tea leaves. Forward price to free cash flow around 37\nx forward price to earnings around 12 x. Yes by this valuation metric. It does look cheap However, there's a\nlot of other factors that you have to take into consideration when looking\nat the actual value of Micron stock. Yeah after after the recent dip in\nthe stock price, we would agree on a forward looking price to earnings\nbasis, Micron does look cheap. And if you do believe we still\nhave a couple years left in this growth cycle, driven by two things. First, of course, AI,\nwhich is a new market. We showed you the chart earlier. But also those other end\nmarkets that still make up the bulk of Micron's revenue. Still at the early stages of recovery, you\nknow, Micron actually might be a decent buy now that the stock has taken a header\nagain, the stock price has been de risked the valuation looks a bit more reasonable. However, do mind that high\nprice to free cashflow multiple. The reason it's so much higher\nis again, that CapEx spending. Micron is building a lot of new\nmanufacturing capacity in the United States to friend shore and onshore,\nsome of their operations, they do see a lot of, a lot of new demand\ncoming for HBM for all that AI. And so that's where a lot of\nthe CapEx is going this year. Uh, just mind that elevated CapEx\nspend because it can cause some pretty wild gyrations and the stock price. So don't, I guess, maybe the ultimate\nmessage here, Micron looks more attractive to us now than it has in quite some time. Uh, some of you are going to be quick\nin the comment section to tell us that we've been dogging on Micron for a while. Not really. We've been dogging on Micron's valuation\nat this point, Kasey likes Micron. They're from Idaho. Which is weird, different story. Just be careful about yoloing into the\nstock, I guess, is the ultimate message. Right. Yeah. That's the key takeaway. Yeah. Take it easy. Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
