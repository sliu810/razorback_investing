OiEH_7YQmJE,New Century's Claudia Sahm talks what to expect from the September jobs report,2024-10-03T16:52:16-05:00,6,UCrp_UI8XtuYfpiqluWLD7Lw,CNBC Television,"('(\'(\\\'(\\\\\\\'(""This morning\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s jobless claims  came in slightly above estimates. The report comes as we await tomorrow\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s september jobs report and its impact on the next fed move joining us is claudia sahm, a  former fed economist great to have you on obviously, there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a lot of  focus on labor data right now, especially as we start to see  the labor market soften. We know inflation is sort of under control and trending in  the right direction and everyone is wondering whether we get 25 or 50 basis points at the next meeting. What are you expecting based on  your modeling for tomorrow and how much hinges on this report >> well, with tomorrow, the best case, what we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re looking for are some signs of that cooling in  the labor market which has been  happening for many months. We just want to see things stabilize. Because we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in a relatively  good place so it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s more of just stabilizing. Nothing is going to be decisive  tomorrow not for the state of the labor market over the coming months  and not for what the federal reserve is going to do yet it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s extremely important that we avoid those scary signs  of a jump in unemployment, really low pay rolls that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not my base case for  tomorrow, but that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s what we need to keep an eye on >> it does seem to me, though, that the fed\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s job of assessing  the data may get trickier over the coming weeks we get one more jobs report  after tomorrow before the next fomc meeting, and we had this  devastating hurricane. Hurricane helene we have boeing workers on  strike we now have a big port strike  finishing its third day. And i wonder how noisy that  could make some of the data we get between now and then >> right any data print we get can be tricky to ead. Things like the port, if the strike would go on, that can be  relatively easy to see in the  data we can isolate that. There are certain other ways with hurricane effects which is  what we have been dealing with the last couple months, trying to parse those in and out of the labor market data. That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s certainly the case. This month is kind of a clean  month in terms of we don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have  an event that we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re trying to  pull out of it, and also, the  data we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re getting come to us, were measured before the fed began their easing cycle it had been telegraphed but we hadn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t seen the 50 basis points. You throw that into the mix, the fed is going to be interested to get any sign on going forward  how their interest rates are affecting the labor market so yes, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to be messy >> claudia, it seems like your take is that if we end up  getting a 50-basis-point cut,  it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s because something has gone  very wrong i also wonder if you expect  we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to continue to get these rather large revisions to  previous jobs numbers. >> so the fed chair jay powell this week was pretty clear, and  i think very consistent with what he said at the last fomc  meeting, that the baseline, if things go as expected and most fed officials are expecting the  unemployment rate to continue to drift up some from 4.2 where it  is right now so they wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be surprised if things weaken a little more. It takes time for that interest  rate to come into play so if things go as expected, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see 25 basis point cuts. Maybe consecutive ones through the end of the year. So kind of a much more standard  issue fed approach to the labor  market cooling as opposed to the bigger 50 basis points it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to take some bad news on employment and not just one data point i think they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll want to look at  both of the employment reports and takes good news on inflation to move them off of this 25-basis-point consecutive let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s move, you know, with purpose but not with great speed towards their lower interest rate. I think that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s completely  appropriate, but it so depends on the data. This is a data dependent fed and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not changing anytime  soon >> so is 148,000 cool enough is it close? where is the line for too cool on the labor number? >> well, you know, when we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in the world of revisions we have to be careful about getting too  attached to one particular number what we see tomorrow might look  different in a month but things start moving below  100,000, getting towards, you  know, even a zero or negative  print, that would cause concern, but we should remember, the u.s. Economy is very complex, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s  dynamic. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hard to pressure. Cue up those revisions so things are imprecise. Even if we were to get a negative pay roll print, that  does not necessarily mean that the bottom is falling out. It justs mean we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in the low 100 thousands and there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s noise. So i think that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to be  the tricky place right now,  where the economy and the labor  market still looks pretty good,  but it may send up some red  flags that cause concern, and we just have to look at t"", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\')\\\', \\\'en\\\')\', \'en\')', 'en')"

IT WAS SUCH A GREAT INTERVIEW  YESTERDAY WITH JENSON AND JULIE. AI FACTORY AND OMNI VERSE. IN TERMS OF HOW AI IS GOING TO IMPACT ALL THESE STOCKS, I THING SYNOPSIS HAS THE BEST POTENTIAL  IN TERMS OF PUTTING AI INTO THE  PHYSICAL WORLD I KNOW YOU HAD THAT GREAT  INTERVIEW AS WELL, AND I THINK THAT TRANSACTION MAKES SO MUCH SENSE. YOU REALLY ARE CREATING A  TECHNICAL SOFTWARE JUGGERNAUT  BETWEEN THESE TWO COMPANIES.

MIGHT THE MEGA CAPS SUCK UP A  LOT OF VALUE THERE >> WELL, IT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S THE GREAT QUESTION RIGHT NOW, WHETHER OR NOT AI IS  GOING TO END UP BEING GREAT FOR  THE LARGE COMPANIES OR BETTER  FOR THE SMALL COMPANIES AND ARE  WE GOING TO SEE A BUNCH OF NEW COMPANIES COME OUT OF THIS WE JUST SAW WORKDAY, SALESFORCE, HUB SPOT, ORACLE ALL HAVE THEIR  ANALYST DAY IN THE PAST FEW  WEEKS.

HUMANS ARE NOT IN THE LOOP THEY ARE CONDUCTING -- THEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'RE BEING CONDUCTED BY HUMANS TO DO  TASKS ON THEIR BEHALF. I THINK THAT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S REALLY WHERE  WE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'RE GOING TO SEE THE EXPLOSION IN SOME OF THESE SOFTWARE NAMES. I PARTICULARLY THINK HUB SPOT IS VERY WELL POSITIONED FOR THIS AS THEY BUILD OUT THEIR ENTIRE  AGENT PLATFORM >> WE ALSO HAD SARAH FRIAR, THE  CFO OF OPENAI ON EARLIER TODAY THEY JUST CLOSED A MASSIVE FUNDING ROUND. THEY HAVE ALSO SET UP A CREDIT FACILITY AND WHILE NOT ANYWHERE NEAR  CLOSE TO AN IPO, ACCORDING TO  THAT INTERVIEW, WE KNOW THERE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S  THIS RESTRUCTURING TO A  FOR-PROFIT ENTITY HAPPENING AND  THEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'RE LOOKING TO INVEST MORE,  DEPLOY MORE INTO THEIR NEXT  GENERATION CAPABILITIES. IT RAISES A QUESTION WHETHER THINGS ARE GETTING VERY FROTHY,  WHETHER IT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS OR MOST NOTABLY IN THE PRIVATE MARKETS AND WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT WHETHER WINNERS AND LOSERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED >> YEAH, LOOK, I THINK AI HAS  THE POTENTIAL TO BE THE LARGEST  PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCER FOR THE  GLOBAL ECONOMY SINCE ELECTRICITY. IF YOU STUDY HISTORICAL  PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES THEY COME WITH  SPECULATIVE BUBBLES. IF YOU GO BACK AND BUILD OUT THE RAILROADS, THE INTERNET, THAT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S  WHAT HAPPENS WITH PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES IT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S NATURAL WHERE WE ARE TODAY, I DON\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'T SEE  THAT NECESSARILY THE GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSE IS TRADING AT ROUGHLY 24 TIMES EARNING. THAT HISTORICALLY TRADES AT 26 TO 28 TIMES EARNINGS AT THE  PEAK IT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S GONE UP FURTHER THAN THAT IF YOU GO BACK TO THE LATE \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'90s, EARLY 2000s.

j1yLSVHcQCU,"Private equity will continue to place big bets on sports teams, says Sportscorp CEO Marc Ganis",2024-10-03T16:46:51-05:00,5,UCrp_UI8XtuYfpiqluWLD7Lw,CNBC Television,"('(\'(\\\'(\\\\\\\'(""Joining us for more on team valuations, head to cnbc.com/sport or scan the qr code on the screen. You can read all of mike\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s reporting and see his list let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s bring in mark yanis, the founder of sports corp good to talk to you. Welcome back >> great to be here. >> how should we be thinking about this dolphins deal which we assume is going to happen at  this point >> the deal is very likely now to happen. The way you look at this is  first, the foundation of the $8.1 billion, is the nfl itself. The nfl is not just profitable it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not just on a continuing  trajectory it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s still a growth business there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s so much more to come in  the nfl. If people saw some of the plans  i have been fortunate to see for the next five to ten years,  roger goodell has plans that he  thinks that far in advance you know, when you start thinking about a sports league where so much capital wants to go into, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the top of the heap it is profitable it has certainty as well with its profitability you look at it, you can say all  right, there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a base. Say $5 billion for each team in  the league and then you add to it things  like the market, things like with the dolphins. They have a variety of different businesses, the miami open, the  formula one race and they execute michael talked about steve ross. They also have an extraordinary  ceo named tom garfinkle, who executes beautifully and they  keep adding assets using the nfl and nfl facilities as the base for them that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s what i think aries saw  here i have spoken with some of the people involved. They saw this as more of the kind of asset that they look at, not just a sports team, but  sports with other assets and growth associated with it. >> i mean, you have been in the  middle of a lot of these deals bringing perspective inspectors  with sellers you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re well versed on how this works. Now that private equity is in  the game, pun intended, do we  feel like that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to  continue in and of itself to push valuations higher how should we view that? >> really an interesting question, scott, because one of  the other deals you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re about to  see, and i think the one that  will get approved first, is the  deal for tom gores to buy  approximately 27% of the los angeles chargers and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not a private equity  deal that is the traditional wealthy  person, wealthy family buying  in think what you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to see here is a mix. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to see an expansion of private equity, but you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re  also going to see more individuals, high net worth  individuals and families buying  in at these high valuations for  the same reasons that the  institutional capital wants to get in the growth, the certainty, the base, and the fact that it is an industry that is in many ways  recession resistant and  uncorrelated to other investment opportunities. >> what do you make of what mike said about the next targets that maybe the eagles, according to the people that he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s talking to, could be high up on that list? >> we keep hearing about the eagles we keep hearing about the  buffalo bills. They\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re building a new stadium,  so they have some need for some  additional capital but that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s really, those are the teams that we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re looking at  right now. The chargers were one, but they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going oo be taken off  the table with tom\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s deal. >> when people look at what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s  happening here and maybe they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re referring more to other sports,  which have sort of ridden the  coattails if you will, of the  nfl as it relates to valuations. They say valuations don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t go up  forever. How do you respond to that >> well, you just had michael  on he can tell you valuations the last decade have gone up 12.5% in the nfl over 11% over the last 20 years. That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s through pandemics, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s through recessions, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s through global financial crises. What we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re finding is that sports has -- there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an interest in sports that is necessary for all the new  technologies that are out there, whether they be social media,  whether they be streaming, whether they be linear television, for many years and cable. So there needs to be content sports is the content for the  world. And we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re getting into a position here that where you have globalization and digitization coming together around and into the sports world that the real smart money you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re seeing is going to continue this explosion "", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\')\\\', \\\'en\\\')\', \'en\')', 'en')"

Looking forward to it. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in a way better than  friday the anticipation october is historically  volatile oil spike, we have that on israel retaliation expeg tases china spike on stimulus. Should investors take these as the exception that proves the  rule of demand weakness or maybe a sign that pessimism on energy  and on china was overdone? >> well, i think first off that  you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re right about october it has 34% more volatility on  average than the other 11 months of the year. And typically, october before an election is usually in negative  territory. I think that we have had the negativism in china and real question is whether the stimulus is going to work right now, seems as if some of that hype is fading at this  point. And yes, there is very big concerns about energy because of what we cannot do about it and that there is a likelihood that there will be a response by israel on iran, and that certainly could push up oil  prices but they have remained pretty  quiet in my opinion. >> okay, so barb, jobs report  tomorrow it seems you expect that it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s  going to continue this narrative of solid job growth overall, justifying a quarter-point cut next i think consensus is 148,000 is there more market action  likely if it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a little higher or a little low? >> well, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a good question, jon, because we hadn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t had so  many good data points this week, i would say if it was a  disappointing number, it could have an impact i think people are still --  powell had indicated earlier this week, 25 cut in november, 25 in december if the economic scenario they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re picturing unfolds. This week, we had today alone, jobless claims and continuing  claims pretty much in line, a  little higher than expected. You had the ism service numbers  which were much higher in terms  of business activity and new orders showing robust economic growth you had the jolts number which is the ratio of job  openings to people looking and the job openings were higher than the last time and of course, the adp number, which is correlated somewhat with tomorrow\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s number it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s private payroll, but even that was better than expected. It would be a surprise if it was negative if it is negative, the market  will take it in stride the market could be down in a  week at this point because it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s  absorbing as we just talked  about what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s happening in the  middle east with israel and iran and the threat to oil, plus the  port shutdown, the walkout there. That by some estimates could cost three-tenths of one percent gdp for every week shutdown. I think the number tomorrow is important, but i don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t think it  will have a big impact and i would be surprised if it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not a good number. >> there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a lot for investors to digest, not to mention the  fact that seasonably, this is a  weak part of the year. To go back to something you just said, at least in the near term, given the geopolitical situation, are equities taking their cue from oil >> i think that they are taking  their cue from oil, because  right now, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not spiking. The feeling is that if iran\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s  oil production and transportation facilities do get hit by israel, then you could  see a very sharp spike moving up to $100 plus but right now, just because of there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a threat out there, the  feeling is that cooler heads will end up prevailing that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s why we have really only seen about a 4% to 7% increase in prices on both wti and brent. And with it hovering below that  $80 per barrel level, i think  that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s causing investors to feel a bit not unnerved but calm  about it all >> yeah, and energy was the best performing sector in the s&p 500, barb, but tech right behind it, and actually, the nasdaq saw a little bit of buying here into the close. Basically closed right below the flat line here we talked about the pop at the top of the hour. We saw in nvidia but is tech the trade right now? especially you talk about some of these mega cap names or does  the rotation continue? >> that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s another interesting  question because we are heading  inturnings season starting in a  few weeks, and the mega cap  tech, a lot have underperformed  over this last few months. You know, as the market has  broadened out with the prospect  of the fed beginning its easing  cycle and with more to come. So i think when we start to see  these earnings people will refocus on big tech and look at  earnings and the growth and the  underlying secular stories and they could catch a bid i think you look at what happened with nvidia as we chatted about.

They had some defections, and  one of those defectors, daria, who went to start anthropic, his big really takeaway from that  experience at openai was instead of throwing hardware at the  problem, make the models more  efficient in terms of their need to use so much cpu power openai has now started to do that i think we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see that playing out in the years ahead i would not anticipate an ipo  anytime soon that was not positioned -- >> doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t seem like it, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s  for sure it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s really -- are you, when you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re out in the valley, i  don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know what surprises you in terms of valuations anymore  because you have seen a lot, but the meteoric growth of this  company where it was valued even at the beginning of this year to where it is now, what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s your reaction what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s your reaction to all  that >> it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s partially the excitement around ai, which some people might make excitement and change that word to hype.

I think that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s why markets are reacting to higher oil prices  today. In a negative way. Now, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a big question of does that actually filter through,  through higher inflation >> the big reason, joe, some say the market is brushing all this  stuff off and treating it as noise for now is because the fed\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s cutting, and the economy is pretty good and we got more evidence of that today, as i said, with ism services is that how you see it >> we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re clearly in a secular  global market. The percentage of global central banks that their last action was a rate cut was 65% we haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t seen that since october of 2020. Yes, there are signs in the eco  data that the consumer, maybe  they just pause their spending intentions over the summer it seems as though it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s  reaccelerating i think ultimately, you have some election angst. Once we get past that, you get clarity surrounding the election on the other side, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re  ultimately making a return to  business investment once again and consumer spending. But unfortunately, geopolitics has control of the near term price action right now it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s lifted the vix above 20 and it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s all about energy right  now. You have the xle, 16 million shares so far today. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the leading sector out of the 11 major s&p sectors and there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s far more room for oil to run. From a positioning perspective it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s bearish sentiment is skeptical >> the real question is, to what degree is the market going to be disappointed by the size and speed of rate cuts it goes to what the chair of the federal reserve, jay powell, told ellen, the same one sitting on our set today, by the way,  that they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in no hurry listen >> this is not a committee that  feels like it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in a hurry to  cut rates quickly. If the economy performs as expected, that would mean two  more cuts this year. A total of 15 more >> you have the goods from the fed chair. Who sort of dialed back  everybody\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s expectations were you surprised at all that that was the answer he had >> i think when you look at the  data that the fed has in hand  since their september meeting, these benchmark revisions to gdp and gdi gross domestic income, were significant, andespeciall gdi being revised up you have higher corporate  profits, lower labor costs than  we thought, higher incomes than  we thought, greater spending,  and the savings rate is still  high even higher than we thought. That cushion is still there. So as he put it in that  appearance on monday, it gives him more confidence that the labor market won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t weaken so much that they have to speed up. That doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t mean that there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not a low bar for going 50, and  i think you have that employment report coming during blackout.

Ripple lab\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Chief legal officer Stewart Al Rod said on acts that the sec\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s decision to appeal prolongs what he calls quote a complete embarrassment for the agency and that the company is weighing whether to file a cross appeal he also questioned whether it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a coincidence that the agency announced the resignation of its enforcement director this morning ahead of the notice of appeal an SEC spokesperson told CNBC that the agency believes the Court\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s decision conflicts with Supreme Court precedent and securities laws it also said that it looks forward to making its case to the second circuit next North Korean operatives are reportedly infiltrating Global crypto

look at the blockchain use case in the hopes that it could make markets more efficient and drive profits we reached out to the cftc for comment but didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t hear back right away okay sticking with tokenization for our main story Visa just announced its new tokenization platform for banks called the Visa tokenized asset platform or VAP now the goal of the new service is to let more than 15,000 Banks use blockchain technology for things like tokenized deposits I spoke with the payment Giants head of crypto Kai Sheffield about that new product and where Visa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s crypto strategy is headed so you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re introducing the Visa tokenized asset platform walk me through what VAP will do yeah so we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re super excited about the announcement you this week uh so VAP you know gives the ability uh for banks to issue and manage Fiat backed tokens uh and so you know one of the things that we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve seen is really the growth and excitement around you know stable coins which are now you know at an all-time high around 170 billion in circulation and we talk to Banks all over the world that are really interested in figuring out how can they issue their own Fiat backed products and so we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re powering you know a lot of these capabilities for them and excited to work closely with banks you know to bring new products to Market and so why launch this platform now is it a product of the kinds of conversations that you were describing as in the market indicates that this is a good idea and that there is a sufficient appetite for this yeah so we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been following this space closely for for many years now and the the story and Genesis behind this platform it was actually a lot of the work that we did with central banks you know across the world and so we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been involved in cbdc pilots and sandboxes uh in Hong Kong and in Brazil and we really got the opportunity to start working closely with banks helping them with technology you know to be able to Mint and manage these tokens and we then decided to commercialize it and make this platform available on the Visa developer portal and we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve got many banks that that work with us today for a range of different solutions and as they start to enter into the blockchain space we V we think Visa could help be a bridge you know for banks to be able to interact with blockchains with their own tokens talk about what this partnership with the banks looks like how are you g to bring them online what kinds of use cases do you think are going to be most relevant to them yeah so our goal is really to be that the easiest way that Banks can get started and I think what we found is you know many banks have been researching they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been exploring they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been participating in working groups uh but you can only learn so much until you actually you know get your hands on a product you know put something out there and so we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve got the sandbox that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s available uh that we announced this week where Banks can come in they can start you know minting burning you know transferring these tokens and there are a range of different use cases that we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re seeing Banks you know interested in and it really depends on the bank you know there are banks that are looking at this as really blockchain\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s becoming a modern Ledger where they can do intra Bank payments that are 247 between their clients we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve got banks that are interested in Capital Market use cases seeing the tokenization of Securities and bonds and real estate they want a cash leg to be able to trade those assets we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve got Banks looking at smart contracts uh and new lending possibilities can they automate a lot of their internal processes and so we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re excited to work closely you know hand inand with banks to help them find the use cases where Fiat tokens Can Be meaningful for their business now what I keep hearing is that the technology involved with tokenizing assets is really the easiest part of the equation you know it took PayPal something like four years to issue py USD because it was a regulatory Nightmare and this is Paypal that we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re talking about so it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not that the technology is what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s preventing people from doing this it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s really the Regulatory and audit piece of this and so my question to you is is Visa doing anything to solve this piece of the puzzle perhaps help a platform or a bank with the regulatory aspect throw visas way behind them uh when it comes to working with digital asset Regulators yeah so we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been engaging with Regulators across the world and and really you know we think it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s important to have you know regulatory you know Clarity you know around you know what are the rules for issuing a stable coin or a tokenized deposit and so you know we plan to continue doing that however you know really here the bank is the licensed you know issuer you of the product uh and so we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re working very closely you know with the banks that we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re partnering with you know to help them find a path to be able to test and get a product live and we think it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not just the technology there are also big questions around rules and standards for how these products should function I think we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve seen Banks start to test and experiment with tokenized deposits and stable coins in a very fragmented way you know banks are writing their own smart contracts you know one bank\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s product looks very different from each other and so you think there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a big role for visa to play to create Global standards and enable a platform where Banks can issue products that can then interact with each other because because they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re built upon the same rules and standards uh you know using the VAP system so is VAP just going to be within the us or are you expanding out to other Global jurisdictions yeah so the goal is for this to be a global platform and you know as the technology enabler you know it really comes down to working closely with banks as the regulated institutions and you know in markets where they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re able to to bring these these products live uh but the technology capabilities uh we plan to to make available very broadly so Fe has been especially Progressive on the crypto front how are you thinking about integrating stable coins into your card business if at all I you know I would imagine that this would present some cool Solutions with respect to Forex and international settlement yeah we think there are huge opportunities here and and we really started you know we set up a crypto team you know really in the depths of the the last bare Market you know about you know five years ago and we really looked you know at a new set of fintech platforms that were building on top of crypto and stable coins and we wanted to give them a path to be able to issue you know Visa cards and I think one of the things that we found is you know as amazing as stable crins can be there isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t Merchant acceptance and so you know they can only have so much utility if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re just holding them as a store of value you need to have a way to spend a stable coin and we think that linking a Visa credential to a stable coin wallet is the best way to do that you we partner with over 50 crypto wallets and exchanges to be able to bring these products to Market and then we start to experiment with how can Visa enable clients to settle with us you know using stable coins on blockchain Rails and you know it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s still early days but we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re seeing you know growing demand and interest from many of our clients that are starting to incorporate stable coins into their corporate treasuries and looking to be able to settle directly with visa on chain and we think there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a huge opportunity to meet clients where they are and start to utilize these Technologies you know to improve our our core Network and and services so to your last Point Visa has been talking about accepting usdc for settlement has that been brought live across the board and can you walk our viewers through what problem this is solving yeah so this is live today you know in a handful of Pilots you know with clients on both the issuing side and the acquiring side and it really started you know when we worked with crypto companies to be able to issue cards we found that a number of these crypto platforms they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re using stable coins to pay their employees you know stable coins to pay their vendors uh and they wanted to use stable coins to be able to pay visa and so we authorize transactions you know in real time and then at the end of the day we need to settle you know with those clients and our goal is to give more options and choice you know to these clients to be able to you know send us their you know preferred uh currency on the preferred network you know that they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re using already uh and so we launched this pilot you know about a year ago uh we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve got a handful of Partners in it uh and we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re seeing you know really early uh positive signs of traction and more and more demand from many of our clients that we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re talking to to start to settle with Visa in usdc as well okay that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s all for crypto world today we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be back again tomorrow and we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see you then"",

Meanwhile, good news for jobless claims still around 225,000, although that level will soon be affected by hurricane helene and the strikes at the ports at boeing, stocks are lower  today. Since october, chopiness continues. My next guest is buying  pullbacks. Joining us now is paul christopher. What do you make of the services data, paul >> the economy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been wiv bifure for some time. If you wanted to look for a  recession case, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s end anyone who depends on bank lending and suffered higher  rates, they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re really suffering. But the services sectors have  been really well we think that will be the engine that propels this economy to a soft landing and then to a recovery to strength >> the chatter i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m hearing is  it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s too strong. Not that people are doubtful that it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s true, but that if it is true, do we have to start worrying about inflation again,  and forget soft landing, do we have to worry that the fed perhaps doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t cut at all like  what we are expecting right now? >> well, there is a disconnect between the market expecting 2.5% of rate cuts and others on  the street as the economy slows, and it is  slowing, service also go with  that that should help moderate  inflation next year. What happens into the balance of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'25, yes, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re right we think inflation picks up in the second half of next year,  amid that cycle improving. That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s why our rate cut forecast is only for eight instead of ten that the market is calling for that will create a little volatility  for next year, but doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t prevent us from starting to  position for that recovery we  think will extend even beyond  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'25. >> what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s interesting to me, as  someone who thinks inflation could prove sticky, you still  prefer large caps over small ones why do you think that kind of  macro is not one that would  necessarily faifer the russell 2,000? >> sticky is sort of a sticky  word you think about 2.5% inflation,  that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s plenty of enough for the  fed to continue cutting rates. If inflation stuck around 3 or 3.5, we would be more concerned  about small caps but we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re positioning right now, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re underweight small caps relative to large, but we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re at  strategic levels we want investors to be at their long-term goals for small caps getting ready for a recovery that will develop more strongly  than inflation will. That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s typically a good  environment for small caps so you want to be at your  strategic, long-term goals >> so you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in communication  services, energy, financials that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a broad way to look at  things, but where would you say  that you see the most  opportunity for alpha relative to the consensus either in specific stocks or sectors? >> yeah, again, because our view on inflation is maybe a little more sanguine than others going  into the year, we would position for the economy to recover early in 2025, expect that to be the main story that explains the predominance of cyclical sectors, or sectors  that should do well as the economy recovers, so industrials, materials, energy,  and financials, all should do  well as the economy recovers >> and finally, on mag seven,  and technology in general here,  what do you do >> technology has looked expensive for a while. We need to see much more of a  pullback we might get that considering  all the uncertainties swirling in the middle east you mentioned the strikes, the weather, the hurricane helene, and the damage that it did this  the southeast part of the  country. Those are all going to register  some kind of hits either to  higher oil prices or to the  economy directly then you have the uncertainties  around the election. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s always uncertainty around election time so a 5% to 7% pullback would not be unusual that might provide a good  opportunity to buy those m"", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\')\\\', \\\'en\\\')\', \'en\')', 'en')"

Great to have you here, welcome. >> great to be here, especially  to talk about generative ai. >> how did you go with generative a snii? >> we partner with several companies, but we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re leaning heavily on openai, and their technology is impressive over the coming weeks, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see more and more upgrades that  create an environment where you  can speak directly to our chat bot penny, like you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re speaking  to your best friend. >> was it a close contend  between openai and some of the others out there or where they the clear candidate? >> at the moment, they are the closest producing a voice  product that can give us what we need within the responses and things  that penny\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s able to give you as a consumer, penny does rely on some of these other services to  do that. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re combining various  technologies to give the best  possible experience for our  customers. >> how much does it cost you as  a company? >> it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s relatively inexpensive to run a chat bot and a  generative ai voice model. Most of the cost comes in the  engineering time with each new model that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been  released by openai, for example, our costs continue to go down  with each new model. Offsetting that is usage we have had over a million conversations taking place within penny, and we have to balance the cost with the  benefit that provides to our business >> are any humans directly involved with the operation of penny? >> not in the actual engagement  and responses that she provides. However, there are a number of humans behind the scenes building out the technology to connect penny to many different  services and to data, including  engineers, product managers, et  cetera, so she can give the best answers as fast as possible. Is this publicly available yet are you able to give us a sense  how quick the uptake might be or the translation from usage into  booking something on the website? >> sure. Well, today, you can engage  directly with penny to do a  number of things service your product, cancel your reservation or book a hotel. Voice just launched yesterday. This is the very first iteration. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not yet using openai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s  latest realtime voice. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been alpha testing that  with them, and we will be one of the first brands to launch that  in the next few weeks. You can engage with penny now, but it will get better once this new connection goes into play. What is is the use case? so i, the consumer, might be sitting on my couch, thinking  about a vacation, previously typing with your chat brot, but  now i can talk to it directly? >> you can say penny, i would  love to go to toronto, can you recommend some hotels? she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll say, what are you looking for? and she will quickly come back with options for you then you can find out what restaurants are nearby, what activities can i do, and she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll  quickly recommend those to you and help you plan your trip. >> two areas in application of generative ai, which is  increasing sales, which you hope penny and voice penny can do and number two, increasing organizational productivity. So we talked about the former, but on the latter front, any other way you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re deploying ai  broadly throughout the organization to make it leaner >> absolutely. We have applications across the  company that we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re using internally one is to help engineers become  more productive in developing  and deploying code this is showing that especially  for engineers who are younger in their careers, rather than having a second developer review their corrode, generative ai does that for them we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve found that it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s great for  learning new coding languages  that developers haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t used before we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been able to bring people  up to speed much faster. So we can get it to market faster, and just have higher --  just better qualified candidates coming to the door >> would you go -- like the  karma ceo is using it to replace salesforce >> i wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t say it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s gone that for us yet we have been investing on the  consumer side in terms of  productivity we think one of the biggest use  cases over the next year in  travel will be for customer  service. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a lot of interactions  that take place every day. Tens of thousands where people are stranded and need support. This technology has proven already that it can reduce the amount of time that it takes for us to get you an answer and then to do a service for you, like  cancel or rebook a reservation it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just faster t"", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\')\\\', \\\'en\\\')\', \'en\')', 'en')"

THE POINT I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'M MAKING ABOUT THEM  NOT GOING PUBLIC IS SAM\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S ON A MISSION. HE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S ON A MISSION TO CREATE THE  FIRST SENSEIENT AI, WITH SUPER INTELLIGENCE AND SOFTBANK MADE A COMMENT  AFTER PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY IN  THIS ROUND THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN  BY 2027. THAT SUGGESTS TO ME THAT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S WHAT  SAM BELIEVES AND WHAT HE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S TELLING PEOPLE HE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S NOT GOING TO GO PUBLIC IF HE DOESN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'T HAVE TO, BECAUSE IT WILL DISTRACT HIM FROM THE MISSION. HE WANTS TO STAY ON THAT MISSION. >> JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOU THINK $157 BILLION VALUATION IMPLIES THE COMPANY SHOULD HAVE A  TRILLION DOLLARS OF REVENUE IN THE NEAR FUTURE? >> WELL, I WOULDN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'T SAY THE NEAR FUTURE, BUT YOU BETTER GET TO  NUMBERS LIKE THAT TO JUSTIFY THIS AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY NUMBERS LIKE THAT IF HE ACTUALLY DOES CREATE A SUPER  INTELLIGENCE SKYNET, IF YOU LIKE, DEPENDING ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW ABOUT AI >> OKAY, THAT SAID, THE  FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH OPENAI  RIGHT NOW IS THE BUSINESS MODEL. THEY MADE $4 BILLION, A LITTLE LESS SO, LOST $5 BILLION THIS  YEAR WHY SHOULD WE EXPECT THOSE ECONOMICS TO CHANGE AS THEY  SCALE? THE CHIPS THEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'RE USING ARE  EXPENSIVE, AND THEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'RE ULTIMATELY GOING TO HAVE TO PAY  LICENSING AGREEMENTS TO GET  UP-TO-DATE CONTENT >> YOU TREND OUT THE LOSS, THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY SPEND PER LITTLE SEARCH OR USE ON CHATGBT, YOU\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'RE RIGHT THEY HAVE TO RAISE SO MUCH MONEY, IT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S HARD TO IMAGINE THEY COULD. BUT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'RE  GOING TO GET EFFICIENCIES AS THEY GO FORWARD WITH THIS  MISSION. THEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'LL GET THINGS CHEAPER PER SEARCH SO TO SPEAK, OR PER INTERACTION. THEY HAVE COME UP WITH SOME  MODELS WHICH ALLOW THEM TO DO  THAT SO I BELIEVE THEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'LL FIND A WAY  TO LOWER THE BIG EXPENSE, BUT  NOT QUITE YET. FIRST, THEY HAVE TO BUILD OUT  THESE DATA CENTERS THIS IS LIKE BUILDING OUT  RAILROADS. A GIGA WATT DATA CENTER IS NOW THE CORE THING OF AI YOU HAVE TO BUILD A LOT OF THEM. AND THE LIMITING FACTOR TURNS  OUT TO BE ENERGY I THINK YOU\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON CNBC. >> SO IN OTHER WORDS, SOME PEOPLE HAVE JOKED THAT IF YOU  WANT TO BE IN OPENAI BUT YOU CAN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'T ACCESS IT JUST BY NVIDIA,  ARE YOU AMONGST THOSE WHO SEE  NVIDIA AND THESE MASSIVE DATER CENTERS AS AN ONGOING  BENEFICIARY OF THIS TREND, OR  ARE PEOPLE GOING TO FIND CHEAPER SUBSTITUTES, OPENAI INCLUDED, TO MAKE THE BUSINESS MODEL A LITTLE MORE ATTRACTIVE? >> I STILL THINK NVIDIA\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S IN THE DRIVER\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S SEAT, BUT YOU HAVE AN IPO COMING UP TODAY WITH A SMALLER COMPANY THAT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S GOT A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO THESE CHIPS. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, I  WOULD BE HAPPY TO. THERE WILL BE INNOVATION COMPETING WITH NVIDIA IN THIS  MARKETPLACE, AND WE SHOULD SEE THE COST OF BUILDING OUT THESE DATA CENTERS DECREASE AS NEWER MODELS COME THROUGH. >> ARE YOU IN THAT IPO WERE YOU A PART OF OPENAI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S  FUNDING LOUNLDZ IF  -- FUNDING  ROUND? >> NO, BUT I WISH I WERE IT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S BUILDING A COMPLETE WAFER INSTEAD OF A SMALL CHIP. NORMALLY THEY DO A WAFER AND CUT CHIPS OUT OF IT. THEY KEPT IT ALL IN ONE CHIP THAT VERSION IS TEN TIMES FASTER TO OPERATE, AND MUCH QUICKER TO SCALE UP THAN THE OTHER WAY OF DOING IT SO IT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S AN INCREDIBLE  INNOVATION I HOPE IT WORKS. >> I WONDER IF IT WOULD BE AN  ACQUISITION TARGET FOR NVIDIA, OR IF THAT TECHNOLOGY COULD BE COPIED OR TO SOME EXTENT IMITATED IF IT IS THAT SUCCESSFUL >> IT MAY BE IT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S VERY HARD TO DO, BUT OTHER  PEOPLE CAN TRY TO DO IT AND  CHASE THEM THE SPEED OF WHICH YOU CAN GET A DATA CENTER UP IS ONE OF THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES HERE. ELON MUSK TALKED ABOUT HE GOT  HIS 100,000 CHIP SYSTEM RUNNING  IN FOUR MONTHS OR SOME NUMBER  LIKE THAT. KIND OF INTERESTING. I THINK THIS -- CEREBRAS HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH SOME PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THE SAUDIS ARE TRYING TO BECOME  POWER HOUSES IN AI, AND THEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'RE  GOING TO DO IT THROUGH THIS  RELATIONSHIP, AMONG OTHERS SO YOU\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'RE GOING TO SEE COMPETITION BETWEEN NATIONS, AS  WELL AS COMPANIES, TRYING TO GET ON THIS AI BAND WAGON. >> WHICH I HAVE TO IMAGINE IS  BULLISH. JUST QUICKLY, DUNCAN, BEFORE I LET YOU GO, CEREBRAS IS AN EXCITING UPCOMING IPO. IS THIS THE BEGINNING OF WHAT  COULD BE A SERIES OF INVESTMENTS NOW THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT AND  WOULD WANT TO INVEST IN? >> PERHAPS THEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'RE COMING OUT AS A SMALL  IPO, $100 BILLION IS THE INITIAL COST, THEY MIGHT END UP HIGHER I EXPECT IT TO DO REALLY WELL. BUT I REALLY LOVE THE FACT THAT  YOU\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'RE NOT WAITING FOR A $100  TYPE OF VALUE TO GO PUBLIC, OR $157 AS CHATGBT OR OPENAI DID. BACK TO THE SMALL IPO, I THINK IN THE AI CATEGORY, WE MAY SEE A LOT OF NEW AND SMALLER IPOs  RUSHING INTO THE MARKET. THAT WOULD BE A VERY POSITIVE  TREND FOR THE PUBLIC INVESTOR, BECAUSE YOU GET IN AT A MUCH LOWER VALUE AND RIDE IT UP TO  THE $157 BILLION VALUE IF IT GETS THERE >> GREAT POINT, THAT IT COULD  BOTH CREATE MORE SUCCESSFUL, SMALLER IPOs AND BRING THEM TO MARKET EARLIER SO THAT THE PUBLIC C"", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\')\\\', \\\'en\\\')\', \'en\')', 'en')"

Wong has to figure out who to give these chips to because there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s so much demand for them and some set up some way of putting people in the queue for it Commodities uh exchange Ki has resumed taking bets on the outcome of the 2024 Congressional elections the move came after a federal appeals court in Washington DC lifted a legal freeze on those uh Futures contracts uh yesterday and the court rejected an effort by the cftc to prohibit that company from taking bets on which party would control Congress a lower court had given the green light to such bets but they were on hold while the C FC appealed the decision the appeals court said the cftc failed to demonstrate that the public would be irreparably injured if trading went ahead while the appeal is being heard Russ Benham from the cftc made this case right here on on the set with us said that it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a way to manipulate elections potentially and there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s no way to see who\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s making the money who\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s placing the bets on those things that was looking at it as part of his purview of it was the last time he was here that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s talked about what I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve said multiple times is this pulls the cftc into the role of being an election cop because if there is manipulation of these markets if someone does take a position long or short which would essentially be on a candidate and then potentially puts out news that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not necessarily true this could spiral into a situation where you have manipulation of Elections seems like a that would be the tail wagging the dog but I guess it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s possible I mean they also lot of congressional races I mean it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s also a way of looking at Market manipulation and I think that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s what they were watching maybe they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re looking at the market manipulation of the the contracts themselves I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t see how you really can game an election based on moving a Cong a four how many seats are we talking about I mean and it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a seven six or seven seat I guess difference right now I guess you maybe you could focus on one I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know it it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an interesting way of looking at things especially when you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not allowed to even talk about exit poles you know leading some of these things you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want toade voters going in right this the first uh first we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve seen I guess we heard about private equity and and the NFL now Miami Dolphins owner Steven Ross is in advanced talks with a PE firm Aries management and billionaire Joe Sai to sell a stake in the NFL team and some other assets and it would value the Dolphins at $8.1 billion this is according to a Bloomberg report that said that are would purchase a 10% stake also in Hard Rock stadium uh in the F1 Miami Grand Prix Joe Sai owner of the Brooklyn Nets and the New York Liberty WNBA team would buy 3% through his family office such a transaction now possible because the NFL uh changed its rules earlier this year to allow private Equity firms to buy stakes and franchises uh Ross had been in talks with citadel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Ken Griffin to buy a steak in the Dolphins and other assets earlier this year uh but the report says those talks fell through so you see with the Wild Card all there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s only one series left the all the other teams it was best of three series and they all won two games in a row like you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re just mad that you lost money I did lose money on the on the on the Dolphins but the Titans I I you know there been so many upsets this year you I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know who was really favored on Monday but the Titans F and by the way we should point out $10 no no I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m not a big better but the Mets are the only team that needs the now it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a not a game seven but it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a game three in a best out of three Series so that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s at 7 o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' tonight G yeah it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s like a game seven like especially for for Mets fans kind of like I kind of like the Mets so I I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want to say that though I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t like the I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll take fans don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want you to say no they don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want me to say that I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t like the Mets I do like the Mets but I I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll say I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t like the MS thank you the members of British rock band Pink Floyd have agreed to sell the rights to their recorded music and name and likeness rights to Sony music for about $400 million that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s according to mle reports that say the deal concluded despite Decades of infighting between band members the catalog had been up for sale for several years but veriety said some potential buyers were scared off by controversial political statements by songwriter Roger Waters against Israel and Ukraine and in favor of Russia and Vladimir Putin total whack job always has been but David Gilmore incredible guitar I I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m surprised it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s

didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t like today ever ever I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been a I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been walking down the streets of New York City it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hard not to get a contact ey here God te will be next coming up next politics and personal finance we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get findings of a news survey about how folks are feeling about their portfolios in the lead up to the elections that report from cnbc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s personal finance reporter Sharon eperson a new po finds nearly a quarter of adults say the outcome of the presidential election will determine whether they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re rich or not and as the Port strike enters its third day we catch up with West Virginia senator Shelley Mo Capo who serves on the Commerce Committee we know that shipping is a huge uh industry and they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re profit making and so those employees should share in that I think as as the benefits of their hard work squ put will\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be right back welcome back to squa pod from CNBC I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m producer CLA ododi and we bring you the best of squawkbox in this podcast every day here\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Joe Kernan just a month actually 33 days until the presidential election one month hopefully not two months before we know the outcome but investors say that they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll feel uncertain about the future of financial well-being until the results are in many are putting Financial decisions on hold but Sharon I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll let you do your report but we we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve known from the past that we worry a lot about it and then when it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s all said and done it usually doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t make that much of a difference I know I know but still that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not how people are feeling Jo you know they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re anxious and separating politics from personal finance can be difficult for many people particularly this election season a new poll finds nearly a quarter of adults say the outcome of the presidential election will determine whether they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re rich or not and have believe the election outcome will directly impact their personal finances that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s according to a survey of 2200 adults by the financial services firm Empower now their retirement Outlook may also hang in the balance with 26% saying they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll never going to be able to retire 29% indicating they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have more money in retirement and 31% saying they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re likely to be more financially secure retirement depending on who wins the presidency on November 5th while the election adds another degree of uncertainty to the markets financial advisors say you shouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t let it derail your long-term investment strategy instead you should be focusing on your asset allocation your goals whether you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re on track to meet them and supercharge Savings in your workplace retirement plans and individual retirement counts also of course stay invested the markets can be volatile around election but historically generate positive returns over time still many Americans are very anxious and a survey by the cfp board and organization that sets standards for certified financial planners finds 80% of adults say they expect the their personal financial situation will be worse if the candidate they vote for does not become president that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a majority of Democrats and Republicans and of course only one party will win so financial advisor say have a framework for making financial decisions that keeps you focused on your goals no matter the election outcome and if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re looking for an adviser to help develop a framework and set up a plan check out cbc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s 6 annual financial advisor 100 list recognizing top firms in the country you can see the full list by scanning the QR code right there on your screen or you can go to cnbc.com F100 Joe yeah only one party will win but there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s three different branches well so you got the house the Senate and so that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s like that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s more than than in in the hope the hope is that it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s split among a lot of people so the two sides that that that think they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to lose if the other side wins in term of the president are they it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s weird because threat to democracy was split down the middle which one was the threat when they when they did PLL so what what do they think on each side about what happens if if the other guy wi well when they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re looking at what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to happen and there greatest concerns Republicans more concerned about increased taxes Democrats more Democrats more concerned about higher health care costs but again there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s framework for that so financial advisors are saying for those people who are concerned about taxes and they have the money to do it they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re doing more and more WTH conversions right now going into this election health care costs we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re looking an open enrollment season this is a time for people to think about what they can do inversion in taxes the taxes now pay the tax now exctly you pay less when you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re taking a na down the road that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an interesting right perspective the idea of I I find it fascinating that people look at their situation and their their retirement accounts and they think that that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s their money many of them are in traditional accounts where a lot of that money is going to be taken up with taxes you do a Roth conversion and then you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t pay taxes you pay taxes now you would pay a big tax bill now a lower rate than later and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s interesting if you look at our deficits it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hard to imagine taxes are going down exactly thank you what do you doing Sharon what am I doing for my no no I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m just I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m just kidding I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m just kidding going over my plan all right being aware okay checking things out good [Music] answer the Port strike is entering its third day and President Biden uh is saying at least at this point he won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t intervene even though some manufacturers and retailers are pushing him to invoke a 1947 law that could suspend it joining us now Shelly Moore Senator Shelley Moore Capo she serves on the Commerce Committee great state of uh of West Virginia it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been done uh before when things get really serious Senator back President Bush invoked half tartly back in 2002 preventing u a Port strike is that is that in the cards um maybe not right now but soon well I think the effects are going to be really felt here probably in the next several days they say a week will take it will take the biggest effect of this strike and I do believe that President Biden\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been asleep here but I think he needs to wake up in terms of his abilities to invoke ta heartly as President Bush did in 2002 you know the the Eastern ports affect so much Commerce so much um business so much ability for food and agriculture other things that this is essential I think for us to settle the strike the strike to get settled and the president needs to take a more aggressive stance here I believe it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a interesting political Dynamic uh now Senator because it it filing something bipartisan and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s sort of support for labor and it it it wasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t always like that so both sides are are like trying to outdo the other in terms of their support uh for working uh people and I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know so that that that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a dangerous combination if you invoke ta tartle you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re kind of like cutting the Union off at the knees are you or how would it work exactly it seems like you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re removing the ability to to do what they need to do to to try to to to get what they feel they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re worth well my understanding is I I fully support the working men and women on our docs there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s uh 45,000 of them that provide incredible work and work hard and a lot of it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s physical labor and and they should be paid uh according to uh their uh their abilities and what they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re doing and get the overtime and all of these things because we know that shipping is a huge uh industry and they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re profit making and so those employees should should share in that I think as as the benefits of their hard work um where I think what uh we look at the rail strike that almost occurred several years ago we saw that the president came in and tried to uh get the two sides together eventually did and and prevented what could have been a devastating um uh strike on on our rail workers this the same can be done for our Dock Workers we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve seen this has been signaled I mean I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve read where the union really hasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t been in the table much effectively over the last several months I hope that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not the case I hope that there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s still all kinds of discussions going on uh between the union and and the um and the businesses but the the fact of the matter is is these things foment uh they have a tendency to draw out longer and I think it has devastating effects as I said on goods and services but also you know we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re looking into a huge shipping uh time of the year for us uh moving into Christmas uh it is affecting the whole East Coast we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve just had a devastating hurricane on the East Coast so we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to need you know emergency supplies more than we ever have so there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s other ramifications here that I think should drive the two sides together I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m hopeful that they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be able to settle this I think in the interest of everybody they will uh it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just we want it sooner than later and I think if the president would weigh in more forcefully I realize the politics of it it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an election year it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an election year but he doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s between Rock and Har he doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want the effects of a strike but he also doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want to you he doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want to hurt you know the Union\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s ability to get what it wants to get effective bargaining Senator Capo what do you think of reports that the union has turned down pay raise of 50% and that so much of it is is reliant on automation and not wanting any automation to come in and I I realize you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re a republican you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve also though uh drawn the support of the United mind workers of America so you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not somebody who\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a union Buster on this situation but what do you think of the offer that it sounds like they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve turned out well I I you know I have been a vibrant I think Union supporter in my own State because it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s important uh we not only with the Mine Workers we have a lot of Steel Workers and others but you know if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not at the table and have reasonable requests you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re never going to get there so in my view on the face of it an American citizen looking and saying you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to get a 50% raise that seems pretty reasonable to me and I I think over the longterm more benefits uh for for the workers I understand they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re asked to work longer hours because of the way shipping works it comes in it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s very intense it goes out the work sort of leaves for periods of time so smooth over those rough edges but a 50% raise in wages over time is is an incredible offer I think I understand they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re asking for 77% when I saw that I thought that was rather unreasonable in my in my view but a 50% raise is is an amazing I think offer back and I think that that the leaders of the Union ought to sit down and really realize what they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re doing to the families who are now relying on another income because they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re off striking there a lot of them are younger workers that have families that are really starting to be extremely concerned about their Futures and how they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to manage the next several months and these are reasonable I think uh offers that I think ought to be taken a lot more seriously than on the face of it it it appears but you know we don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know really what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going on between the two sides and hopefully they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll come to a resolution quickly Senator uh Senator Capo everything changes when you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re uh when you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re this close to to an election and I I I could see many different things happening and then you know then you got Boeing you got all kinds of it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s very strange and and you know all the hot spots around the world it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a little distress is it not I I it is very distressing but let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s look at it at the face of the the American getting up every day and take their kids to school they want to work they want to earn a wage they want to earn a living wage they want to be safe to me that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the political issue get get our workers back to work and that will go to the benefit of whoever can do that the the quickest okay Senator we we got had other things we could have talked about uh I guess control the Senate house Etc but maybe next time thank you I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d love to thank you next on sagp pod can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t we all just get along Columbia Professor Michael Morris on the division the silos the separate teams of tribalism somehow we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re wired to hate Outsiders we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re wired to hate the other I think that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just not a picture that any evolutionary scientist or behavioral scientist would recognize this is squa POD up and back you you are watching squawkbox right here on CNBC I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m Becky quick along with Joe kernin I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m here Andrew is off today our next guest has unique insights on the concept of tribalism and how it impacts us Politics the sea Suite college campuses everywhere as we saw with the unrest at colleges and universities earlier this year joining us right now is cultural psychologist Michael Morris Columbia University Professor he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s got a new book out this week it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s called tribal how the cultural instincts that divide us can help bring us together and Michael thanks for coming in thank you so much for having me I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve watched your show for years it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a real honor you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re the one we are thrilled to have you here um but you have to explain to me tribalism I look at it as a a pretty divisive situation in the United States these days how how do you actually see it as a superpower well I think tribalism means you know the the psychology that enables us to live in large communities with shared assumptions and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s what got us out out of the Stone Age right it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s what underlies everything that works an organization like this or you know the city of Manhattan it works because we have you know a shared culture but that doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t mean that it never goes Ary and we see it going Ary quite a bit in the current moment I think I would like to say that it was precious but I think I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m lucky to have a book on tribalism coming out in the fall of 2024 when we have we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re teetering on the edge of a war in the Middle East and we have a really div Ed government and we have the largest labor union threatening to shut down the supply chain so there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a lot of collective action in ways that not entirely positive right now so this is tribalism gone ay and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s where we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re looking for things that that differentiate us instead of things that commonalities well one of the main reasons I wrote this book is because I think the tribalism has come into currency as a term and as a catchall explanation over the last 10 years and what the way it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s often defined and talked about is that somehow we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re wired to hate Outsiders we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re wired to hate the other another group and I think that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just not a picture that any evolutionary scientist or behavioral scientist would recognize uh we have these social instincts that are called tribal instincts but they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re instincts for solidarity not instincts for hostility they occasionally lead to conflicts where hostilities develop but the the conflicts don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t start from hostility so what went wrong what what what went arai I think it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a different story in in every case you know so what went arai in our politics is a kind of tribalism but it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not a tribalism of hate you know it didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t start with Democrats hating Republicans it started from living in different worlds holding different beliefs and then being baffled at the other side and then starting to doubt the other side\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s sincerity and how did we come to live in different worlds well the the the splintering of the media had something to do with it you know we used to all get our news from Walter cronite and we were kind of all on the same page but when you have partisan news channels that that serve different constituencies uh we are we are living in bubble Chambers and we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re getting further and further apart in our assumptions I mean I thought it was I I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m ready to start looking at uh uh you know in in you know where you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re doing an autopsy I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m starting think we need to look at brains I think there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a left brain right brain there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s things that I see in and things I believe I look at what other people believe and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s like Venus and Mars not men but one person\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s from Venus the other\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s from I mean left brain right brain I I can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t even figure where some of of the thinking comes comes from at this point what do we need exchange student programs maybe it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s that maybe it is the that people live in in an echo chamber it gets drilled in for so long they don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t even visit the other Echo chamber that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s right and I think if we if we understand that these Echo Chambers contribute to it then there are things we can do personally we can break out of our bubble we can change the channel on our television uh and get exposed to a different stream of news um I think that one of the big mistakes is to think that these cultural worldviews are sort of permanent and we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re stuck with them but they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re really not I mean we we all have internalized multiple cultures and we switch between them you know we call it code switching uh when you know it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s about you know ethnic or racial cultures but we all do that you know when you come into work it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a different self it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a different worldview than when you uh go home or when you go to church or when you go to the gym and so you know if we understand the levers that uh cause people to switch from one cultural identity to the next then we can lead people through their culture and we can Ian I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m not kidding about an exchange program student I mean all of us spending more time with each other and trying to get understand each other but describe specifically what you think has gone wrong on college campus because you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re a professor at col and this has been something that we watched you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve actually talked to the Pres I think you tried to I haveed to help i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve um so at Colombia a lot of us you know are there because we we take pride in a tradition of political engagement you know it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been a relatively political campus and uh that has gotten ugly at certain points in the past you know the Vietnam War but it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s also had some great results like it helped it helped you know fuel the anti-ap paride movement you know Colombia was one of the first campuses and it spread and it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s one of the reasons that Mandela got released this campus protest across the world so a lot of us were kind of proud at first but then it it it clearly metastasized in a direction that was not healthy and that was not a teachable moment that nobody was learning from you know it was sort of activism that just became acrimony and the group started as you know expressions of solidarity for different groups of civilians in the Middle East and a few months later the groups thought each other were the problem you know they were attacking each other and so uh why why at Colombia did it go this way whereas there are other universities my wife went to Rutter and at Rutter things ended very constructively the president Jonathan Hy he uh he welcomed the activist he said universities learn from activism this is the energy that helps us update our policies and you know make ourselves I went to Ruckers too and it wasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t a smooth transition along that entire point I saw a video of protesters where Holloway was there and then left and the Jewish students who were there were kind of left with a group of angry protesters he was taken out with police guards okay so it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not been smooth everywhere it hasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t been Colombia there for sure right Michael I think but I think the the the campuses that have been worse are like UCLA and Colombia in the middle of really large cities where the student activists are ringed by professional activists and they they start to see their mission as as aligned with these more seasoned activists both both sides I think at Columbia became co-opted by more extreme groups the the tolerance is is a one-way Street on a lot of these liberal campuses my and and I wonder how that happened over years and years is it those are the people that are hired at the the college campuses it I mean it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s nice to be you know to to feel virtuous and I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m um you know there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a group of oppressed people that I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m going to you know go demonstrate for but there are actual times where someone might be ready to for an opposing Viewpoint and they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not welcome anywhere near that college and and that that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not tolerance that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not open-minded that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not Progressive that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just closed-minded and tribalist yeah well we did have two sides on our campus that were both represented you know very forcefully we had a sort of pro-israel group and we have probably the strongest ties to Israel of any major campus in the US and we also had a strong you know Gaza solidarity movement but you had you Hader Pro there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a promas pro October 7th kill the Jews contingent yeah but Jewish students there it really you know there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s always a difference between what most people in the protest are saying and then the extreme statements that get picked up by the media right there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a competition for attention there was no uh there were no consequences they were suspended all the some of the people screaming genocide of the Jews are back at school now uh I agree that it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a tough question of what um they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d be they should be out yeah I you know I I agree with that I agree that there it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not acceptable to you know kids are afraid they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re still afraid to go to class A lot of a lot of Jewish students and they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re still being harassed and everything else that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not you

silent and the university doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have a position that that enables full debate among faculty and students so the the university hosts the debate but is not a

_R6Wg4HYYkM,Redfin CEO: Inventory will be the gating factor for home sales in 2025,2024-10-03T11:13:20-05:00,5,UCrp_UI8XtuYfpiqluWLD7Lw,CNBC Television,"('(\'(\\\'(\\\\\\\'(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'(""With the fed cutting joining us today is redfin ceo glenn kelman good to get your intelligence  and insight. What did you see in september? >> we saw an improvement at long last we had seen interest rates fall  in august and home buyers had  almost no reaction because they  were waiting for the federal reserve to cut rates that finally happened. And now many people who had been on the fence are coming back into the market. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not a tidal wave but a real swell. >> i was going to say, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve seen some other -- for example,  we got an upgrade of home depot. They did a survey asking homeowners -- or home buyers who have been waiting to buy what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s  the magic number in terms of the rate that could get them off the sideline where do you think that number is >> well, already we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re seeing  more people come off the sideline, so home buying demand  is up about 10%. Purchase applications are up about 10%. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been a marked increase every time rates come down further we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see more this rate cut was probably too late in the season to have a major impact on 2024 i think in 2025 many home buyers are going to say, game on. >> so, in light of that, glenn,  what is it going to take to see  more meaningful levels of  inventory hit the market i mean, rates coming down is certainly one piece of the puzzle but what else needs to  kick into gear here? >> that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the right question on that front, i don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t expect to see much progress. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re talking to many people who are rate locked. They got a mortgage at 3% or 3.5% a few years ago and they still can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t afford to buy their own home 2.5% of american homes changed hands in the past 12 months, which is a 30-year low so, on the inventory side, we  are still going to be crimped. That is going to be the factor for home sales in 2025 maybe we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get up to 4.5  million from a low of 3.9  million this year, but it isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t  going to be 5 million or 6 million because there just aren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t enough people who want to sell their home. >> so, to i want ask you because you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t been on since this change went into effect. But i do wonder what you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re  seeing in terms of industry  dynamics since that brokerage  industry practice, those changes actually came in in august >> well, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a tale of two  markets. There are places where there hasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t been much change at all if you go to north carolina or new jersey, almost all home  buyers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' agents are being paid  about 3% but in other markets like san  francisco or boston, there are significant negotiations taking  place. Part of it that homes are more expensive there so people are  asking their agent for a better  deal so it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been market by market. Some of that is about high bound the market is and some is about  how high the home prices are increasingly, listings are being put on the market where the  seller says, what i pay the  buyer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s agent issing inable. Multiple offers may come in. One with a fee of 3% one with a fee of 2% all else being equal, they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll  take the offer that only has to  pay 2% to the buyer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s agent. So, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to see more  activity in the spring that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s when i expect more  bidding wars that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s when i expect more  pressure on fees right now we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re just going through this trial period. In some places there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s negotiation and some places  there isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t much >> as for rates, you know, glenn, the market\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s counting on  continued interest rate cuts all the way through the first half of next year and i wonder how good you think  spring could be if, in fact, that happens no guarantees. Whether or not activity  surprises us in the off-season >> i think it can be medium  good it can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be great because there  are still so many homes on the sidelines. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not going to be a rush to list properties usually when we go through a housing market correction, we  correct the problems we had. In 2008 there were too many  people under water on their  mortgage and then we saw a wave  of foreclosures and short sales. This time the inventory shortage hasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t been addressed and i  think it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to be a long-term problem. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a 30-year mortgage that many people have they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re only five years into it. I think the market can get better but it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not going to be gang  busters next year.

YOU\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'RE SEEING A LITTLE BIT OF  THEIR INVENTORIES HIGHER TO GIVE THEM A BUFFER, PARTICULARLY IF THE STRIKE IS ONLY ONE TO TWO  WEEKS.

That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a small sector within the s&p 500. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not cutting out of stocks. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been leaning into large  cap stocks for a long time we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been overweight there. You mention that we had brought  the small caps up to neutral we have been underweight there for a couple of years. That was a pretty widespread trade out there. But we felt like as we get closer to what is going to be  early cycle, and i think we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re still late cycle here, we have a couple of slow quarters ahead of us, you want to stick with the quality growth names, the  quality growth sectors you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want to get overly defensive. Stocks clearly aren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t cheap and  there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a lot of risks out there.

I think you have to try to focus on what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to happen in the economy, which is probably a little bit of a slowdown from  here a little higher unemployment more fed rate cuts that lead to  probably some better economic  performance. Maybe as we move into the second half of next year. Hopefully we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see better global performance as well.  >> we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve had good revisions. Adp, best since june i just wonder how aggressive you would be in a pro cyclical mode. We got upgrades of materials,  for example, on the street last  couple of days >> yeah, i mean, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve liked industrials and materials for a  while because we think the status center buildout has legs. Clearly, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to -- you  have to build data centers and have better electrical grids and you need materials and industrial companies to do that. We do like that. So, i think that cyclically we want to be a little bit -- we  don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want to be totally defensive. We want to lean xardz an economy that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not going to go into  recession, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to have  a soft landing saying that, carl, i think the risks to a soft landing is that  you get no landing while it looks like we could easily have a couple of, you know, maybe sub 2% quarters  ahead of us, first quarter of  next year, i think the risk is there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to be better economic performance so, we want to be ready for  that.  >> scotts, i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m looking at your year-end 2024 target, 5400 we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re above that, 5693 do you feel you need to take that higher? do you expect we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see a  pullback here? how are you thinking about these final three months of the year >> well, morgan, i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d love to see a pullback because, as i said, i think by the second half of next year, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to be clear that we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in a modest growth, modest -- modest growth, modest  inflation economy. That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s usually pretty good for stocks you and i have talked about this in the past, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve tried to be patient here we had a decent pullback in  october of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'23 we had a quick pullback after  the july jobs report came out. We tried to take advantage of  both of those. And with the risks we all know are out there, you know, i think -- i think we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re comfortable with our target. We may be a little low in the  end. But i think there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a good chance here that over the course of the next couple of months that we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to he so some sort of pullback 10%, which is not really a bold  call or anything like that, but  if you get a seven or ten or maybe some more on bad jobs data or some hints that, hey, the fed might not cut as many times next year, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s how you get the pullback we want to be re"", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\')\\\', \\\'en\\\')\', \'en\')', 'en')"

Appreciate it. >> i guess more near term trying to get through october,  seasonality, the election, is it going to be a month of hedging and what do you think we need to get past, other than the election, obviously? >> yeah. So i think these employment  reports continue to be very  important to the market, and i think that will be the biggest driver in the short term as we think about long term, we  think the fundamentals around  economic growth continue to be positive the fundamentals around  companies\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' earnings growth continue to be positive and, you know, as you mentioned, we have  some kidnappers around the multiple expansion that we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve  seen so far this year. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been a great year but the equity market up 20%, but  earnings only up about 10% >> what are your earnings  estimates for next year and do you think the consensus is too hot? >> yeah. So the consensus so far for next year is a about 14 or 15%  growth i would be more comfortable  around a 10% growth assumption for next year. I think within that consensus  numbers there are a number of  sectors like cyclical sectors  where there are pretty aggressive improvements in earnings growth for next year  and hopefully that will be the case with lower interest rates and stimulus in china, but that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not something that we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d want to bank on yet. I would feel more comfortable  with a little bit more modest  increase in the overall  consensus earnings estimates for next year. >> the s&p 500 just turned positive, albeit fractionally  and we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re basically moving off the lows of the day here looks like you have major  averages looking to attempt to rebound. The ism services data is pretty  strong how much now hinges on a jobs  report tomorrow and is that even enough if it were to come in softer than expected for the fed to cut 50 basis points.  >> does it matter how much the fed cuts through the end of the  year, as long as they get to where they say they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to  get next year? >> i don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t think whether it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s 50 basis points next month or 25  and 25 or if they pause, i don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t think that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to have a dramatic impact on the outlook for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'25. I think the data continues to  support them continuing to ease  and recalibrate as they say. We can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t focus too much on one month of job reports, but the  trend is moving in the right direction from an inflation  standpoint and a labor market  balance standpoint, so that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s  encouraging. And so we continue to believe  the fundamental economic backdrop continues to be positive.  >> we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been talking about  geopolitical risks all week and  the market continues to keep an  eye on that and as we get  headlines and there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the  expectation sooner rather than later perhaps once we come out of this holiday, you see a retaliation from israel against  iran, how do you navigate that here and given the fact that valuations for the s&p are already, arguably, pretty rich by some metric, is that an exogenous threat in the near term or something that could help trigger a pullback? >> yeah. It seems that we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been battling through a number of exogenous threats over the last  year, even a couple years, and so this is certainly something that we need to keep an eye on and hopefully it doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t escalate further and have an impact on global markets you know, again, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s something  we need to watch i think in the  short term i don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t think it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to have a dramatic impact "", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\')\\\', \\\'en\\\')\', \'en\')', 'en')"

President bush invoked this back in 2002 preventing a port  strike is that in the cards, maybe not  right now, but soon? >> well, i think the effects will be really felt here probably in the next several days\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s they say a week it will take the biggest affect of the strike and i do believe that president biden\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been asleep  here but i think he needs to wake up in terms of his  abilities to invoke this as  president bush did in 2002 you know, the eastern ports  affect so much commerce, so much business, so much ability for  food and agriculture, other  things, that this is essentially i think for us to settle the strike the strike to get settled, and the president needs to take a  more aggressive stance here. >> it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an interesting political dynamic now, senator, because  it -- finally something  bipartisan and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s sort of support for labor. It wasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t always like that so both sides are, like, trying  to outdo the other in termses of their support for working  people, and i don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know -- so that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a dangerous combination if you invoke taft you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re kind of cutting union off at the  knees. How would it work exactly? seems you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re removing the  ability to do what they need to  do to try to -- to get what they feel they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re worth.  >> well, my understanding is, i  fully support the working men  and women on our docks there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s 45,000 of them that  provide incredible work and work hard and a lot of it is physical labor, and she should be paid  according to their, their  abilities and what they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re doing and get the overtime and all of  these things, because we know  that shipping is a huge  industry, and they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re  profitmaking those employees should share in  that, i think, as benefits of  their hard work. Where i think what we -- look at the rail strike that almost  occurred several years ago we saw the president came in and tried to get the two sides together eventually did prevented what could have been a devastating strike on our rail workers. This, the same can be done for our dockworkers. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve seen this. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been signaled i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve read the union really hasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t been at the table much  effectively over the last  several months i hope that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not the case i hope there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s still all kinds of discussions going on between  the union and the -- and the businesses but the fact of the matter is, these things foment, have a  tendency to draw out longer and  devastating effects on goods and services as i said, bit also looking into a huge shipping time of the year for us. Moving into christmas. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s affecting the whole east  coast. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve just had a devastating hurricane on the east coast. So we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to need emergency supplies more than we ever have. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s other ramifications here i think should drive the two side together. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m hopeful they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be able to settle this. I think in the interests of  everybody they will. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just we want it sooner than later and i think the president  would weigh in more forcefully i realize the politics of it.  >> it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s ap election year an election year he doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t -- he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s between a rock and a hard place. Doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want the effects of a  strike but also doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want to  hurt, you know, the union\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s  ability to get what it wants to  get. >> bargaining. Yeah senator capita what do you think that the union turned down pay raise of 50% and so much is  reliant on automation. Not wanting automation to come in i realize you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re a republican  and also, though, draw support of the united mine workers of  america. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not somebody who\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a  union buster on this situation,  but what do you think are the  offer sounds like they turned  down >> i have been a vibrant supporter in my own state  because it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s important not only with mine orkers. We have a lot of steel workers and others if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not at the table and have reasonable requests you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re  never going to get there my view, face of it, an american city looking get a 50% raise seems pretty reasonable to me. I think over the long term more  benefit for the workers. I understand they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re asked to  work longer hours because of the way shipping works comes in intense. Goes out work sort of leaves for periods  of time. Smooth over those rough edges, but a 50% raise in wages over  time is an incredible offer, i think. I understand they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re asking for  77%. When i saw that i thought that was rather unreasonable, in my view, but a 50% raise is an  amazing, i think, offer back and i think that the leaders of the  union ought to sit down and  really realize what they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re  doing to the families who are  now relying on another income, because they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re off striking a lot of them are younger  workers with families that are really starting to be extremely  concerned about their futures  and how they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to manage  the next several months. These are reasonable, i think, offers that i think ought to be  taken a lot more seriously than  on the face of it. It appears we don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know, really, what it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going on between the two sides,  and hopefully they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll come to a  resolution quickly >> senator capito, everything  changes when you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re this close to an election i could see many different things happening and then, you know, got boeing, all kinds  of -- it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s very strange.

Politics, the c suite,  college campuses everywhere as we saw with the unrest at  colleges and universities  earlier this year. Joining us right mao is cultural psychologist michael morris, columbia university professor, new book out this week called  ""tribal: how the cultural  instincts that divide us can help bring us together."" thank you for coming in. >> thank you so much for having  me i watched your show for years. It is an honor.  >> you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re the one. >> thrilled to have you here you have to explain to me, tribalism, i look at it as a pretty divisive situation in the united states these days how do you actually see it as a  superpower >> well, i think tribalism means, you know, the psychology  that enables us to live in large communities with shared  assumptions. And that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s what got us out of  the stone age, right it is what underlies everything  that works, an organization like this, or, you know, the city of  manhattan, it works because we have, you know, a shared culture. But that doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t mean that it  never goes awry. And we see it going awry quite a bit in the current moment. I think i would like to say it was prescience, but we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re  teetering on the edge of a war in the middle east and we have a divided government and we have the largest labor union  threatening to shut down the supply chain so there is a lot of collective action in ways that not entirely positive right now. >> this is tribalism gone awry >> yes.  >> that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s why we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re looking for  things that differentiate us instead of things that --  commo commonalities. >> one of the reasons i wrote  this book, i think tribalism has come into currency as a term and as a catch-all explanation over  the last ten years and the way it is often defined  and talked about is that somehow we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re wired to hate outsiders, wired to hate the other, another group. I think that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just not a  picture that any evolutionary  scientist or behavioral  scientist would recognize. We have these social instincts that are called tribal i instincts. They occasionally lead to  conflicts where hostilities  develop, but the conflicts don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t start from hostility >> so what went wrong? what went awry >> i think it is a different story in every case. So what -- what went awry in our politics is a kind of tribalism, but it is not a tribalism of hate it didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t start with democrats hating republicans it started from living in  different worlds, holding  different beliefs, and then  being baffled at the other side. And then starting to doubt the other side\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s sincerity and how did we come to live in different worlds well, the splintering of the media had something to do with it weused to all get our news fro walter cronkite and we were all  on the same page but when you have partisan news  channels that serve different  constituencies, we are living in bubble chambers and we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re  getting further and further  apart in our assumptions.  >> i thought it was -- i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m ready to start looking at, you know, in, you know, where you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re doing an autopsy, i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m thinking we need to look at brains. A left brain, right brain. There is things i see in things  i believe, i look at what other  people believe and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s, like, veno venus and mars, one person is  from venus and one person is from mars. Left brain, right brain. I can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t figure where some of the thinking comes from at this  point. Maybe it is that people live in  an echo chamber gets drilled in  for so long, they don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t visit  the other echo chamber >> i think that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s right. If we understand the echo  chambers contribute to it, there are things we can do personally, we can break out of the bubble,  change the channel on our  television, get exposed to a different stream of news i think that one of the big  mistakes is to think that these  cultural world views are sort of permanent and we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re stuck with them but they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re really not we all have internalized multiple cultures and we switch  between them we call it code switching when,  you know, it is about, you know, ethnic or racial cultures, we  all do that. You come into work, it is a  different self, a different  world view than when you go home or when you go to church, go to  the gym. And so, you know, if we  understand the levers that cause people to switch from one  cultural identity to the next, then we can lead people through  their culture and -- >> i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m not kidding about an  exchange program student all of us spending more time with each other and trying to  understand each other, but describe specifically what you think has gone wrong on college  campuses you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re a professor at columbia and this is something we have  watched -- >> columbia. You actually talked to the president -- you tried to help >> i have. So at columbia, a lot of us, you know, are there because we take  pride in a tradition of  political engagement it has been a relatively political campus and that has gotten ugly at  certain points in the past the vietnam war, but it also had some great results like it helped, you know, fuel the antiapartheid movement, columbia was one of the first campuses  and it spread and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s one of  the reasons that mandela got released, this campus protest  across the world a lot of us are proud at first but it clearly ma etastasized ia direction that nobody was  learning from. An activism that became acrimony and the group started as expressions of solidarity for  different groups of civilians in the middle east. And a few months later, the  groups thought each other were the problem, attacking each  other. And so, why -- why at columbia did it go this way other universities -- my wife  went to rutgers. At rutgers, things ended very  constructively the president, he welcomed the activists, said universities learn from activism. This is the energy that helps us update our policies and, you know, make ourselves better. >> i went to rutgers too and it  wasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t a smooth transition along the entire point i saw video of protesters where  holloway was there, and then left and the jewish students who were there were kind of left with a group of angry  protesters he was taken out with police guards >> okay. >> so it has not been smooth everywhere it hasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t been columbia there  for sure.  >> right.  >> but i think the campuses that have been worse are like ucla  and columbia in the middle of  really large cities where the  student activists are ringed by  profes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\')\\\', \\\'en\\\')\', \'en\')', 'en')"

I THINK THERE IS A COUPLE OF THINGS TO REALLY FOCUS ON. NUMBER ONE, VALUATION, WHICH IS  NEVER REALLY A CATALYST IS NOT OUR FRIEND TO YOUR POINT NEXT YEAR, EXPECTATIONS AT 15% EARNINGS GROWTH IS A LITTLE BIT  LOFTY. WE HAVE TO SEE IF THE CONSUMER WILL HANG IN THERE WE THINK THEY WILL BUT PROBABLY A BIT OF A PULLBACK IN ESTIMATES FOR NEXT YEAR THE OTHER NUMBER TO PAY  ATTENTION TO, IMPORTANT TO TALK  ABOUT IT NOW, IS WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH GUIDANCE FROM COMPANIES. WE STILL THINK THE BIAS FROM CFOs WILL BE IN TECH SPENDING, CLOUD, AWAY FROM ENTERPRISE  SOFTWARE, AWAY FROM ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS, BUT ALSO THINK THAT THE CONSUMER ACROSS THE BIFURCATION ACROSS THE UPPER INCOME CONSUMER AND LOWER INCOME CONSUMER, THAT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S THE BIGGEST VARIABLE TO SEE IF THE ECONOMY STILL WORKS AND IF CORPORATE EARNINGS WILL COME IN AT THOSE LOFTY LEVELS EXPECTED FOR NEXT YEAR.  >> SO, THERE WILL BE NO  EXPANSION -- MULTIPLE EXPANSION, WE DON\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'T NEED IT, THE EARNINGS WILL TAKE CARE OF WHATEVER ADVANCE WE GET >> THE SWING FACTOR ON MULTIPLE  EXPANSIONS WILL BE THAT BELT BETWEEN WHERE THE FED IS FOR NEXT YEAR, AT YEAR END, FED  FUNDS VERSUS WHERE THE MARKET  IS THE MARKET THINKS THE FED IS GOING TO CUT BY 50 BASIS POINTS  MORE THAN THE FED SAID TWO WEEKS AGO. IF THE MARKET IS RIGHT, THE FED  IS WRONG, WHICH WE THINK IS  PROBABLY THE MORE LIKELY CASE. WE THINK THE CONSUMER ON THE LOWER INCOME SIDE WILL SLOW DOWN MORE YOU CAN SEE A POINT IN CHANGE OF MULTIPLE EXPANSION THAT REQUIRES FED FUNDS COMING DOWN TO SOMETHING LOOKING MORE LIKE 3.5 OR A 4. THAT IS THE SWING FACTOR SO, AGAIN, I THINK THERE WILL  NOT BE AS WE LIKE TO SAY A NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED SET OF  EARNINGS COMING OUT FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF QUARTERS TECH WAS THE DARLING THE LAST  COUPLE OF YEARS. HAS BEEN MORE UNDER PRESSURE ON  THE CHIP SIDE, BUT WE STILL  THINK THAT, AGAIN, NO BETTER CURE FOR HIGH PRICES THAN HIGH PRICES AND CERTAINLY IF YOU LOOK AT LABOR TRENDS, WHICH WE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'LL GET AN UPDATE ON TOMORROW, CFOs ARE SPENDING MUCH MORE ON CAPITAL  THAN ON PEOPLE SO THAT, WE THINK, IS STILL A  DECENT TAILWIND FOR TECH INVESTOR AS WE PUSH FORWARD INTO THE NEW YEAR >> THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT SAY THE SECULAR BULL THAT WE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'RE IN RIGHT NOW ISN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'T EVEN THAT OLD.

WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN INVESTOR PSYCHOLOGY IS THE FOCUS ON INCOME AND INVESTORS GOT AWAY WITH  REALLY HIGH MONEY MARKET RATES SO THEY SAW 5, 5.25% RETURN ON THEIR CASH I THINK THAT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S CHANGED IN TERMS  OF MARKET PSYCHOLOGY PEOPLE TEND TO LOOK MORE NOW AT  THEIR INCOME IN THEIR PORTFOLIOS THAN THEIR TOTAL RETURN.

Joining us right now is cameron  mitchell, the ceo and founder of cameron mitchell restaurants,  and we have been checking in with him routinely since the pandemic cameron, thank you for being with us today. >> thank you, becky. A pleasure to be with you. >> let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s talk about what you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re  seeing and let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s put this in the  context of the federal reserve,  what they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re doing right now we got a jobs report coming up tomorrow the federal reserve has  basically said they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not so  worried about flation anymore, that seems to be the part of the mandate that looks good from their perspective. They\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re more worried about the labor market and softness there. Does that match up with what you see in your restaurants across the country? >> yes, i think so, becky. We are -- all of our costs are much lower than they were than before we have raised our prices this year we raise our prices 4% a year. There is some consumer stress  there, so, we have only taken 2, 2.5% price increase this year. We think inflation has slowed  down interest rates coming down certainly will help us,  certainly will help us on our  interest expense as we move  forward. So, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re fairly optimistic  about going forward here and especially into 2025.  >> what do you see from  consumers at this point. Are they willing to spend on things like wine, on desserts, on appetizers? >> yeah, so we have been in  business 31 years and we only  have had negative same store sales a couple of those years. You know, the recession of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'09 was one of them. Covid is another one this year we experienced a drop  in our fine dining sales of  about 5% meanwhile, our more casual segment restaurants are up 1% or 2% for the year. So, company wide, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re down sales this year about 3.5%,  little under 4%. The good news is, i think  september we just finished up, and for the first month this year, september was up 2% over last year in sales, same store sales, so, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see how that  holds for q4 going forward here. >> cameron, if this only happened a few times where you have seen sales down, the other  two times, the great recession and covid, do you think what you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re seeing now is a harbinger of worse things to come or is  this something where, look,  we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re coming off such high numbers, maybe it is not shocking to see the decline? what does it feel like to you? >> i think it is the latter, becky. I think it is just a reset out there. In 2021-\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'22, there was such  euphoria out there, covid was  over, so much money out there in the system, and people were  spending and jubilation and so forth. And so now in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'23 inflation  hits, interest rates rise, people start to pull back, which is natural and it is just a  resetting of the economic  environment for us we look at 2025 now five years out from covid, the past four  years are all a result of covid. I think \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'21-\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'22 sales were inflated weren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t really normal. Our guest counts are still to  this day above 2019, so i think  we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re okay this is just a natural resetting that is going on right now and people for the time being  gravitating down toward the  lower end check.

The market rose and it has been  topping out. It broke below 5,780 level that is one area we have been  looking for and we have not been able to get back above it. You see traders today this morning. That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a little bit of an  indication we really can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get above there. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m a little bit cautious until  we get above the 5,780 level.  >> to be clear, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a bearish signal >> it is this pattern is a mini head and  shoulders option when you look at a five-minute chart and short-term and the increase in volatility to start  october, to me, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a bearish move here. That 5,780 is a critical level we broke below i think now the pressure is to the down side in the near term.  >> what about the pricing with the that increased we have had a lot of events in the recent days. >> we have we have started to see put traders start to uptick the  premiums they are relative to  pay relative to calls. A put is a protection on the down side of the market. We have seen a heightened level  in the last month or so where  basically traders are trying to  buy more protection to the down  side than they want to the upside that trend completely reversed for the last two years it has  been the other way around. Call buyers in the market and  traders trying to buy the upside call the reverse happened the laust two months they want the protection to the  down side. A lot of geopolitical tensions in the atmosphere and election next month couple that with another fed meeting at the beginning of  november and two unemployment  reports if you consider this friday and the week of the election week. Couple that with earnings. A lot of volatility. >> brian, you are spelling out the next question. What is the options market telling us about the upcoming  events the elections coming up and the  jobs report and the fed meeting. What is the options market tells us about all that? >> when we look at the level of  the voluatility with the vix, th fed moves 1% we saw that a little bit to  start october, but not the last  couple trading days. I think it is waiting to digest  the unemployment report coming out this friday here and maybe make a move here certainly expectations are heightened we will get a fairly  sizable volatility event or move coming up in october >> what about the nasdaq i thought it was interesting moves there. Spell it out for us as well. >> the nasdaq is sort of interesting. When sort of the yen carry trade unwound in august, we saw a lot  of selling pressure in the nasdaq it seemed people were moving out of risky assets and heading into the ten-year note and u.s.

9A9pqpohyOg,"Iran’s existing deterrent against Israel striking has collapsed, says David Albright",2024-10-03T06:55:30-05:00,8,UCrp_UI8XtuYfpiqluWLD7Lw,CNBC Television,"('(\'(\\\'(\\\\\\\'(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'>>> president biden urging israel to take a proportional  response to the iran missile attack this week that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a nice way of saying it the president said he would not  support targeting iranian sites. David albright is the founder  for institute for science and  international securities so many different facets and nuances to this, david in fact, there is an editorial in the ""wall street journal"" that seems like the biden  administration is more intent on deterring israel than it is on deterring iran before talking to netanyahu, says don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t go after the nuclear  sites. You make some interesting points that because israel might do it, iran might rush it it may force them to rush it,  which the feedback loop comes  back to israel which might force them to act in a matter of days  or weeks because everybody is  being rushed into doing things after what happened earlier. >> that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a very dangerous situation and iran is more vulnerable to being struck by  israelis at the same time, iran is close  to building nuclear weapons and  feels pretty strong here and deterrent of israel striking collapsed. Two missile attacks and not a  single hit of significance the ring of fire created by  proxies is damaging. Iran, i believe, does have a stronger motivation to build nuclear weapons and israel has conceded that iran is vulnerable now to a strike. How this all works out i don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know as the days go by, iran has more time to prepare against an israeli strike and try to  protect its nuclear weapons  capability assets like 60% enriched uranium and they could  move it and centrifuges that are being stored it is a situation that may not result in israel attracting  iran\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s capabilities now. That may change. This vulnerability of iran will  persist and iran\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s motivation to build nuclear weapons will go  on i think president biden\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s  statement is incredibly  unhelpful. Behind all this, there is a  strategy and a policy to make  iran so scared about building  nuclear weapons because of military strikes, it doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t do  that and here he has undermined  that here, i think his comments are out of place and unhelpful >> a lot of facets to this when i step back and look at the entire picture -- david, just  stepping back and looking at why iran needs a nuclear weapon. I think they do because they like to destroy the state of israel there are a lot of nuclear capable countries and they all,  i guess, thought for different reasons to have that ambition, but this is -- is this a defensive ambition for iran? if it is purely an offensive move to be able to destroy israel, all theyhave to do is  just stop developing a nuclear weapon why can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t they say we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not developing one we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll put it aside and coexist with israel. >> many iranians with elevated intellectual classes realize a downside there is an inch closer, but don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t do it. What\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s happened, unfortunately,  which changed things is i think  the iranian regime is running  scared and they thought this ring of fire that manifested by  hezbollah principally and hamas  and houthis would retain the attack and israel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s ability to do things the region that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s collapsed and their missiles don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work well i think they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re running scared right now and there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a risk they will rush to a bomb out of  that fear. >> all they have to do is stop developing the bomb. Yeah --  >> that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s true stop >> they wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be attacked and -- let me read one thing lisa, you know lisa, i assume, david. She says as the biden  administration has made major  concessions in tone and policy,  tehran understood minimal to actions and to that end, continue to spin the centrifuges and final component. The latest comments from biden because we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve already gone down  that rabbit hole as far as how we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re -- at this point --  >> the biden administration came in saying they will get a longer and stronger nuclear deal and  conceded to get something. It has been downhill since then. Yes, they have had a policy that has has been principally based on  crisis you encourage our adversaries. Iran is an adversary, if not an  enemy, at least the regime yes, they encouraged them. Iran feels they can make the progress and shorten the time to be able to produce weapon-grade  uranium for a bomb no real punishment when evidence emerges of the advancements of the nuclear weapons program. The biden policy has not worked  and we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re suffering consequences of it and it could be war. >> in conclusion, both hands are being forced iran\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hand is being forced and  israel is being forced at what timeframe, david in a matter of weeks >> i don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want to put a timeframe on it. America should deliver a message to iran that their nuclear program will be reduced to a burnt out cinder if they build nuclear weapons. >> we don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know.  >> we should focus on -- >> isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t it deep underground we don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have the ability -- they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re close enough now to  where we wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know if they took that step do we have people? >> don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t underestimate israel  and they may surprise us they said two years ago, they  needed two years to prepare to attack iran\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s nuclea\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\')\\\', \\\'en\\\')\', \'en\')', 'en')"

I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m Frank Holland the anchor of worldwide exchange right now I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m joined by the CEO of Ericson Boya eom Boya thank you for joining us thanks Frank thanks for having me um right now I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m holding a letter an open letter that you and a number of other European CEOs along with some other us CEOs sent to European Regulators to talk about AI regulation can you give us the high level uh when it comes to this letter and what exactly are you concerned about yeah the the letter is of course an open letter that we signed and it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been led by meta and and what it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s all about is the uh the fragmentation of European AI regulation where you have the AI act you have gdpr and it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to be interpreted by many different agencies so it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s actually slowing down AI adoption in Europe and and the the reali is I think this is a bigger question than AI only of course AI is such a cent piece but the the reality is Europe is falling behind the US dramatically today GDP is per capita is about 30% lower in Europe half of that is productivity differences and that really is explained by the lack of a tech sector so the concern here is bigger it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just that the AI I guess is the topic of the day let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s get to the bigger concern in a minute I want to ask you you signed this letter clearly because you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re concerned about your company first and foremost most in your shareholders and maybe some of the productivity gains or margin gains in your business you could see so if there were less regulation on artificial intelligence how would it directly impact Ericson\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s business you know the the AI is such a maybe actually the most horizontal technology the world has known it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to be a productivity booster as well as helping to Define new offerings to the market that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a space we need to be in for us AI is really fundamental it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the way we operate networks and also how do we actually run Energy Management how do we do fault detection how do we do optimization of the network that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s where we need to be competing with with all the other vendors and of course we are European based we have a large part of our R&D in Europe and for us it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s critical that we can offer the market those products and solutions so so as you say there there is a big element of self-interest here and and the reality is you know we have 60% of our R&D give or take some in Europe and and of course we need to look at where are we going to put R&D in the future so so I do as other CEOs of other companies you allocate R&D where it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the most beneficial to put it and and you know we launched an R&D Center in Canada just recently you know it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s kind of hurting Europe and longer term this I think is a problem for Europe okay so you say it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a problem for Europe that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s very interesting you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not saying it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a problem for Sweden or one particular country so I want to ask you is the issue overregulation or is it fragmentation of Regulation from country to Country it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s both actually uh you know I I actually don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t think it has a value to be a front runner in regulation so if you take the AI regulation specifically what Europe has done is to become a front runner on regulation and and now you know as I travel in other countries notably the US they say it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s interesting that Europe has done this now we can learn what actually works and what doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work and What Hurts the companies what doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t hurt so so we are kind of a bit of a guinea pig in Europe and I think that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not good for European long-term prosperity and to be clear you say you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re more of a guinea pig when it comes to regulation actually not Innovation which is what you want to get to like a lot of other Western countries and also aot of other Emerging Markets to be fair like China and India you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re absolutely right I mean I I do believe Innovation is the key driver of what I would call Prosperity in the economy so if we in Europe are going to long-term defend our way of living the kind of the cultural values our system uh societal cohesion it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s driven by Innovation so we need to put Innovation at the top of the agenda and and that doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t necessarily equal regulation I think we need to think differently we need to say we are going to lead on Innovation we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to make it attractive to invest in R&D we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to make it attractive to invest in capex we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to create a paneuropean market One Market one Europe uh etc those are much more important than focus on regulating AI so you hit on some of the upside gain if there were less regulation on AI you mentioned GDP you mentioned productivity um is there any particular sector of tech that you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re thinking of that would specifically benefit from less regulation in Europe well I I think actually the the interesting thing with tech tech used to be a sector in the economy so if you go back 20 year we would talk about the tech sector the interesting thing now is that Tech is no longer a sector it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s actually impacting everything in the economy so if you think think about if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to produce cars today technology is a fundamental component if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in machine or or kind of production Machinery technology is a fundamental part so so technology we shouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t think of it as a sector we have to think of it as horizontal that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the same thing with the industry I mean connectivity it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s very horizontal it touches upon every part of the economy of course you and I as consumers we use it but the interestes thing what can you do leveraging for example Advanced connectivity in Factory Automation in automating ports in automating logistics chains so we are talking about these horizontal Technologies in reality and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s where the the regulation hurts us the most uh so you said Europe seems to be in your mind a guinea pig when it comes to regulation but I do have to say Europe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s also a leader when it comes to data privacy um obviously data is very important artif IAL intelligence and training models if you could talk to Regulators about your need for data and how to meet that with the regulation that they have in mind that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s you know genuinely designed to protect consumer and consumer data what would you tell them we have 27 countries implementing uh slightly different versions and we get for example in the AI Act and the gdpr creates an unclarity how can you run open models in that for example so if you think about the implication is just making it uncertain for us why would we invest billions in actually Building Products in the EU when it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an uncertain regulatory environment so fragmentation this the size of the regulation is a problem here also uh just a short time ago you mentioned Logistics very briefly I do have to ask you uh the East Coast Gulf Coast Port strike here in the United States does that have an impact on your business either your ability to import products here or get products from United States of course it does impact the supply chains but but we are relatively um not affected by that and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s because we are one of the few with a factor in the US so we actually produce 5G equipment in in in Texas in our own Factory so so we are to a large extent less impacted but over time we will of course also be impacted"",

I think inflation expectations are too low. Supply and demanded will probably push oil prices higher. If i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m rideght and oil surges, e could see a push higher 1% year  over year. >> that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s before you factor in the stoppage at the docks? >> correct absolutely in, i if, in fact, we get a surge, you have a risk recession which is not nothing and risk acceleration with the  overheating of the economy potential growth in the united states is 1.8% the third quarter growth is  forecast at 3% we are growing at 2.8. There is inherent risk from that perspective. Add to that monetary and fiscal  easing as well as upside potential and commodity prices china is engaging in the bazooka stimulus if they pull it off >> those opec guys lie, i think. $50.

I won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t discount we get to 5,800 or 6,000 by the end of the year. That doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t mean we don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t see risks in the offing. Becky, when you see complacency  at this level, with the vix and  with the vix drop, that makes  hedges cheap you want to be deploying those when the markets are pretty  exub exuberant. I would say protect your gains our top pick is utilities. It performed year to date tech at this point, what we recommend is take the profits. Gold has done remarkably well. It is looking overbought at this point. I do like protecting your gains  going into next year, especially with this level of complacency in the markets >> healthcare, is that contingent upon either party winning or is it not necessarily where you are looking at big drug companies >> it is a play on the valuation. Going into the election, we have never seen the markets reaction  positively a moonth before the  election my team has look ed at the  numbers. The s&p 500, if it is up three months before election day, the  incumbent party wins it does play into the wealth effect if people are feeling good, they vote for the incumbent party there are a few exceptions mixed in with eisenhower and reagan. I feel this case could be  different with the immigration issue, but the wealth effect is  still there. >> you have money on the sidelines? >> right if the s&p continues to power  higher, it gives power to the  harris administration. >> what else do you like beyond  health care? >> the other things in the sector are if we continue to move higher in the a.i. Trade  and industrial real estate if we see a continued move higher there, you want to play the second derivative trade. If the markets drop, i would be  a buyer of the s&p.  >> what about the number we are  waiting for tomorrow how foreimportant is that? >> labor has taken place in  regards to the market. The volatility is because the  fed is data dependent. I think that is actually a detracting factor to the markets being data dependent and markets hanging on every labor market  piece of data. We have have initial jobless cl  today. My bet is about 200,000 the big question is what happens in october i think there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to be an ugly labor market report because of the furloughs and strikes and hurricanes for the month of  october. >> to some extent, we can look at every data point and be worried about it overall, the fed has decided it  is going to ease and maybe that  is more than important >> look at the broader overall move and the fact there is a dual mandate not hitting that 2% target on average and the  potential of a reacceleration. I think they are focused on the  second part of the mandate which is the employment sector maybe they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'r"", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\'en\\\\\\\')\\\', \\\'en\\\')\', \'en\')', 'en')"
