      "   - There is an expectation of potential rate cuts which could benefit small and mid-caps more due to their lower interest coverage ratio compared to larger companies.\n",

      "1. **Discussion with Aoifinn Devitt:** \n",
      "   - The focus is on the performance of small and mid-cap stocks, which are noted to be currently down by 2% for the quarter. However, they are expected to outperform the broader market in profit growth terms.\n",
      "   - Small and mid-cap stocks are predicted to experience significantly faster profit growth than the S&P 500, with anticipated growth in the high teens to over 20%, contrasting with the S&P 500's expected growth in the low teens.\n",
      "   - There is an expectation of potential rate cuts which could benefit small and mid-caps more due to their lower interest coverage ratio compared to larger companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dan Flax's Insights:** \n",
      "   - Discussion mentions a focus on small and mid-cap stocks, emphasizing their strong performance particularly as the market navigates through the challenges posed by potential recessions.\n",
      "   - The market conditions favored small and mid-cap stocks over tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet, which are currently seen as less attractive due to ongoing valuation corrections.\n",
      "\n",
      "These discussions suggest a significant interest and potential in small and mid-cap stocks amidst current market conditions and economic outlooks. Unfortunately, specific details as to which video or speaker provided these insights were not included in your provided excerpts.\n"
