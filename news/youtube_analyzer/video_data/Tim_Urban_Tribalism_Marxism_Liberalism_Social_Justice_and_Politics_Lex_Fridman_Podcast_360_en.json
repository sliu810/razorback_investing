    "- A radical political movement of which there will always\nbe a lot in the country has managed to do something that a radical movement is not supposed to be able to do in the US, which is they've managed\nto hijack institutions all across the country and\nhijack medical journals and universities and the ACLU, all the activist\norganizations and nonprofits. And many tech companies. And the way I view a liberal democracy is, it is a bunch of these institutions that were trial and error\ncrafted over hundreds of years. And they all rely on trust, public trust. And there's certain\nkind of feeling of unity that actually is critical to a liberal democracy's functioning. And what I see this thing is,\nis there's a parasite on that, that whose goal is, and I'm\nnot saying each, by the way, each individual in this is I\ndon't think they're bad people. I think that it's the ideology\nitself has the property of its goal is to tear apart\nthe pretty delicate workings of the liberal democracy and shred the critical lines of trust. - The following is a\nconversation with Tim Urban, his second time in the podcast. He's the author and illustrator of the amazing blog called \"Wait But Why,\" and is the author of a new book coming out tomorrow called\n\"What's Our Problem, A Self-Help Book For Societies.\" We talk a lot about this\nbook in this podcast, but you really do need to get it and experience it for yourself. It is a fearless, insightful, hilarious, and I think important\nbook in this divisive time that we live in. The Kindle version, the audiobook, and the web version\nshould be all available on date of publication. I should also mention that my face might be a bit\nmore beat up than usual. I got hit in the chin pretty good since I've been getting back\ninto training jiu-jitsu, a sport I love very much, after\nrecovering from an injury. So if you see marks on my face during these intros or conversations, you know that my life is\nin a pretty good place. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Tim Urban. You wrote an incredible book\ncalled \"What's Our Problem, A Self-Help Book For Societies.\" In the beginning, you present\nthis view of human history as a thousand page book\nwhere each page is 250 years. And it's a brilliant visualization because almost nothing\nhappens for most of it. So what blows your mind most\nabout that visualization when you just sit back and think about it? - It's a boring book. So 950 pages, 95% of the book. Hunter Gather is kind\nof doing their thing. I'm sure there's obviously\nsome major cognitive and advancements along\nthe way in language. And I'm sure the bone arrow\ncomes around at some point. So tiny things, but it's like, oh, now we have 400 pages\ntill the next thing. But then you get to page\n950 and things start moving. - Recorded history starts at 976. - [Tim] Right, right. - [Lex] So basically the bottom row is when anything interesting happens. There's a bunch of agriculture for a while before we know anything about it. And then recorded history starts. - Yeah, 25 pages of\nactual recorded history. So when we think of prehistoric, we're talking about pages\none through 975 of the book. And then history is page 976 to 1000. If you were reading the book,\nit would be like epilogue, A.D., the last little\n10 pages of the book. And we think of A.D. as\nsuper long, 2,000 years. The Roman Empire 2,000\nyears ago, that's so long. Human history has been going\non for over 2,000 centuries. It's hard to wrap your head around. And this is, I mean,\neven that's just the end of a very long road. The 100,000 years before that, it's not like that was that different. So there's been people like\nus that have emotions like us, that have physical sensations\nlike us for so, so long. And who are they all? And what was their life like? I think we have no idea\nwhat it was like to be them. The thing that's craziest about\nthe people of the far past is not just that they had different lives, they had different fears,\nthey had different dangers and different responsibilities and they lived in tribes and everything, but they didn't know anything. We just take it for\ngranted that we're born on top of this tower of knowledge and from the very beginning, we know that the Earth is\na ball floating in space and we know that we're\ngoing to die one day, and we evolved from animals. Those were all incredible\nepiphanies quite recently. And the people a long time ago, they just had no idea what was going on. I'm kind of jealous 'cause I feel like it might've been scary to\nnot know what's going on, but it also I feel like would be, you'd have a sense of awe\nand wonder all the time and you don't know\nwhat's gonna happen next. And once you learn, you're kind of like, oh, it's a little grim. - But they probably had the\nsame capacity for consciousness to experience the world,\nto wander about the world, maybe to construct\nnarratives about the world and myths and so on. They just had less grounded\nsystematic facts to play with. They still probably felt\nthe narratives, the myths that constructed as intensely as we do. - Oh, yeah, they also fell in love. They also had friends and they had falling outs with friends. - They didn't shower much though. - [Tim] They did not smell nice. - Maybe they did. Maybe beauty's in the eye of the beholder.\n- Yeah. - [Lex] Maybe it's all like relative. - How many people in history\nhave experienced a hot shower? Almost none. That's like, when were hot\nshowers invented 100 years ago? Less. So George Washington\nnever had a hot shower. It's just kind of weird. He took cold showers all the time or like. - [Lex] Yeah. - And again, we just\ntake this for granted, but that's like an\nunbelievable life experience, a controlled little booth where it rains hot water on your head. And then you get out\nand it's not everywhere. It's contained. A lot of people probably lived and died with never experiencing hot water. Maybe they had a way to\nheat water over a fire, but then it's, I don't know. There's so many things about our lives now that are completely, just total anomaly. - It makes me wonder like, what is the thing they\nwould notice the most? I mean, the sewage system, like\nit doesn't smell in cities. - Incredible. - What does the sewer system do? I mean, it gets rid of waste efficiently, such that we don't have to confront it both with any of our senses. And that's probably wasn't there. I mean, what else? Plus all the medical stuff\nassociated with sewage. - Yeah, I mean, how about the disease? - [Lex] Yeah. - How about the cockroaches\nand the rats and the disease and the plagues. And then when they got, so\nthey caught more diseases, but then when they caught the disease, they also didn't have treatment for it. So they often would die or they would just be\na huge amount of pain. They also didn't know\nwhat the disease was. They didn't know about microbes. That was this new thing, the idea that these tiny little animals that are causing these diseases. So what do they think? In the bubonic plague, in\nthe black death, the 1300s, people thought that it was an act of God because God's angry at us. 'Cause why would you not think that if you didn't know what it was? And so the crazy thing is that\nthese were the same primates. So I do know something about them. I know in some sense what\nit's like to be them, because I am a human as well, and to know that this particular primate, that I know what it's like to be, experienced such different things. Our life is not the life that this primate has\nexperienced almost ever. So it's just a bit strange. - I don't know. I have a sense that we would\nget acclimated very quickly. If we threw ourselves back\na few thousand years ago, it would be very uncomfortable at first, but the whole hot shower\nthing, you'll get used to it. - Oh, yeah.\n- After a year, you would not even like miss it. There's a few, trying\nto remember which book, that talks about hiking\nthat Appalachian Trail. But you kind of miss those hot showers. But I have a sense like\nafter a few months, after a few years. - [Tim] Oh, yeah, well\nyour scale recalibrates. - Yeah. - Yeah, I was saying the\nother day to a friend that whatever you used to,\nyou start to think that, oh, the people that have more\nthan me or are more fortunate, it just sounds incredible. I would be so happy, but\nyou know that's not true. Because the experience, what would happen is you\nwould get these new things or you would get these new opportunities and then you would get used to it, and then with the Hedonic treadmill, you'd come back to where you are. And likewise, though, because\nyou think, oh, my God, what if I had to have this kind of job that I never would want, or\nI had this kind of marriage that I never would want. You know what, if you did, you would adjust and get used to it. And you might not be that much\nless happy than you are now. So on the other side of the,\nyou being okay going back, we would survive if we had to go back. We'd have to learn some skills, but we would buck up, and\npeople have gone to war before that were in the\nshopkeepers a year before that. They were in the trenches the next year. But on the other hand,\nif you brought them here, I always think it'd be\nso fun to just bring, forget the hunter gatherers,\nbring a 1700s person here, and tour them around,\ntake them on an airplane, show them your phone and\nall the things it can do. Show them the internet,\nshow them the grocery store. Imagine taking them to a Whole Foods. Likewise, I think they would\nbe completely awestruck and on their knees, crying tears of joy. And then they'd get used to it and they'd be like complaining about, like you don't have\nthese oranges in stock. - The grocery store is a\ntough one to get used to. When I first came to this country, the abundance of bananas was the thing that struck me the most. Or fruits in general, but food in general, but bananas somehow struck me the most that you could just eat\nthem as much as you want. That took a long time for me. Probably took several years to really get acclimated to that. Is that? - [Tim] Why didn't you have bananas? - The number of banana, fresh bananas, that wasn't available. Bread, yes, bananas, no. - Yeah, it's like we don't\neven know what to have, like we don't even know the\nproper levels of gratitude. Walking around the grocery store, I don't know to be like, the bread's nice, but the bananas are like, we're so lucky. I don't know. I'm like, oh, I could\nhave been the other way. I have no idea. - Well, it's interesting then\nwhere we point our gratitude in the West, in the United States. Probably, (sighs) do we point it away from\nmaterialist possessions towards, or do we just aspire to do\nthat towards other human beings that we love? Because in the East and the Soviet Union, growing up poor it's having\nfood is the gratitude. Having transportation is gratitude. Having warmth and shelter is gratitude. And now, but see within that, the deep gratitude for other human beings. It's the penguins huddling\ntogether for warmth in the cold. - I think it's a person by person basis, I mean, I'm sure, yes. Of course, in the West people\non average feel gratitude towards different things or maybe a different level of gratitude. The person that's most\nlikely to feel gratitude is going to be someone\nwhose life happens to be one where they just move up, up,\nup throughout their life, a lot of people in the\ngreatest generation, people who were born\nin the '20s or whatever and a lot of the boomers too. The story is the greatest\ngeneration grew up dirt poor and they often ended up middle class and the boomers, some of\nthem started off middle class and many of them ended up quite wealthy. And I feel like that life\ntrajectory life trajectory is naturally going to\nfoster gratitude, right? Because you're not gonna\ntake for granted these things 'cause you didn't have them. I didn't go out of the country really in my childhood very much. We traveled but it was to\nVirginia to see my grandparents or Wisconsin to see other relatives or maybe Florida after\ngoing on to the beach. And then I started going out\nof the country like crazy in my 20s, 'cause I really\nbecame my favorite thing. And I feel like, if I had\ngrown up always doing that, it would have been another thing. I'm like, yeah, that's\njust something I do. But I still, every time\nI go to a new country, I'm like, oh, my God, this is so cool. I'm in another country. This thing I've only seen on the map. I'm like, I'm there now. And so I feel like it's a\nlot of times it's a product of what you didn't have\nand then you suddenly had. But I still think it's\ncase by case in that, there's like a meter in everyone's head that I think at a 10, you're experiencing just\nimmense gratitude, right? Which is a euphoric feeling. It's a great feeling\nand it makes you happy. It's to savor what you have, to look down at the\nmountain of stuff you have that you're standing on, right? To look down at and say,\noh, my God, I'm so lucky. And I'm so grateful for\nthis and this and this. And obviously that's a happy exercise. Now, when you move the\nmeter down to six or seven maybe you think that sometimes but you're not always thinking that 'cause you're sometimes looking\nup at this cloud of things that you don't have and\nthe things that they have, but you don't or the\nthings you wished you had or you thought you were\ngonna have or whatever. And that's the opposite\ndirection to look, right? Either that's envy, that's yearning or often it's if you\nthink about your past, it's grievance, right? And so then you go into a one and you have someone who\nfeels like a complete victim. They are just a victim of the\nsociety, of their siblings and their parents and their loved one and they're wallowing in everything that's happened wrong to me. Everything I should have that I don't, everything that has gone wrong for me so that's a very unhealthy,\nmentally unhealthy place to be. Anyone can go there. There's an endless list of\nstuff it can be aggrieved about and an endless list of stuff\nyou can have gratitude for. And so in some ways, it's\na choice and it's a habit. And maybe it's part of how we were raised or our natural demeanor, but\nit's such a good exercise. You are really good at this, by the way. Your Twitter is like.\n- Go on. - Well, you are constantly\njust saying, man, I'm lucky. Or like, I'm so grateful for this. And it's a good thing to do because you're reminding yourself, but you're also reminding\nother people to think that way. And it's like, we are lucky. And so anyway, I think that\nscale can go from one to 10. I think it's hard to be a 10. I think you'd be very\nhappy if you could be. But I think trying to be above a five and looking down at the\nthings you have more often than you are looking up\nat the things you don't or being resentful about the things that people have wronged you. - Well, the interesting thing, I think, was an open question, but I suspect that you\ncan control that knob for the individual. Like you yourself can choose. It's like the stoic philosophy. You can choose where you\nare as a matter of habit, like you said. But you can also probably\ncontrol that on a scale of a family, of a tribe,\nof a nation, of a society. I mean, you can describe\na lot of the things that happened in Nazi Germany and different other parts of history through a sort of societal\nenvy and resentment that builds up. Maybe certain narratives pick up, and then they infiltrate your mind. And then your knob goes to, from the gratitude for everything, it goes to resentment\nand envy and all that. - Germany between the two world wars, like you said, the\nSoviet kind of mentality. And then when you're soaking in a culture, so there's kind of two factors, right? It's what's going on in your own head and then what's surrounding you. And what's surrounding you\nkind of has concentric circles. There's your immediate group of people. Because that group of people,\nif they're a certain way, they feel a lot of gratitude\nand they talk about it a lot, that kind of insulates you\nfrom the broader culture. Because people are gonna\nhave the most impact on you or the one's closest, but often, all the concentric circles\nare saying the same thing. The people that are around\nyou are feeling the same way that the broader community,\nwhich is feeling the same way as the broader country. And I think this is why I\nthink American patriotism, nationalism can be tribal,\ncan be not a good thing. Patriotism, I think is a great thing because really what is patriotism? I mean, if you love your country, you should love your fellow countrymen. Patriot, that's a Reagan quote. Patriotism is like, I\nthink a feeling of unity but it also comes along\nwith an implicit concept of gratitude because it's like,\nwe are so lucky to live in, people think it's chauvinist to say, we live in the best country\nin the world, right? And yes, when Americans say\nthat no one likes it, right? But actually it's not\na bad thing to think. It's a nice thing to think. It's a way of saying, I'm so grateful for all the\ngreat things this country gives to me and this country has done. And I think if you heard\na Filipino person say, you know what, the Philippines\nis the best country in the world, no one in America\nwould say that's chauvinist. They'd say awesome, right? Because when it's coming from\nsomeone who's not American, it sounds totally fine. But I think national\npride is actually good. Now again, that can quickly\ntranslate into xenophobia and nationalism, and so\nyou have to make sure it doesn't go off that cliff. - Yeah, there's good\nways to formulate that. We'll talk about high-rung progressivism, high-rung conservatism. Those are two different ways\nof embodying patriotism. So you could talk about\nmaybe loving the tradition that this country stands for, or you could talk about loving the people that ultimately push progress. And those are from an\nintellectual perspective, a good way to represent patriotism. We gotta zoom out, 'cause\nthis graphic is epic. A lot of images in your book\nare just epic on their own. It's brilliantly done. But this one has famous\npeople for each of the cards, like the best of. - Yeah, and by the way, good\nfor them, to be the person, it's not that I could\nhave chosen lots of people for each card, but I think\nmost people would agree. You know, that's a pretty\nfair choice for each page. And good for them to be, you know, you crushed it if you can be the person for your whole 250-year page, so. - Well, I noticed you put\nGandhi, didn't put Hitler. I mean, there's a lot of\npeople gonna argue with you about that particular last page. - [Tim] True. Yes, you're right. I could have put him, I actually, I was thinking about Darwin there, too. - [Lex] Darwin, yeah. Einstein. - [Tim] Yeah, exactly. You really could have put anyone. - [Lex] You think about\nputting yourself for a second? - Yeah, I should have, I should have. That would have been awesome. I'm sure that would have\nendeared the readers to me from the beginning of the\nfirst page of the book. - A little bit of a messianic\ncomplex going on, but yeah. So the list of people, just so you know. So these are 250-year chunks. Last one being from 1770 to 2020. And so it goes Gandhi,\nShakespeare, John of Arc, Genghis Khan, Charlemagne,\nMuhammad, Constantine, Jesus, Cleopatra, Aristotle, Pluto. That's so interesting to think about this very recent human history. - That's 11 pages, so it would\nbe 2750, almost 3,000 years. - Just that there's these\nfigures that stand out and that define the\ncourse of human history. - The craziest thing to me\nis that Buddha was a dude. He was a guy with arms\nand legs and fingernails that he might be bit and\nhe liked certain foods and he had digestive issues sometimes and he got cuts and they stung and he was a guy and\nhe had hopes and dreams and he probably had a big\nego for a while before he, I guess, Buddha totally overcame that one. And it's like who knows what\nthe mythical figure of Buddha, who knows how similar he\nwas, but the fact, Jesus, this was a guy, to me, he's\na primate, what an impact. - He was a cell first and then a baby. - [Tim] Yeah, he was\na fetus at some point. - He was a dumb baby trying\nto learn how to walk. - Yeah, like having tantrum\nbecause he's frustrated because he's in the terrible twos. Jesus was in the terrible twos. - Buddha never had a\ntantrum, let's be honest. The myth. - The mother was like, this\nbaby's great, like, wow. - [Lex] Let's figure something out. - I mean, listen, hearing\nabout Genghis Khan, it's incredible to me\nbecause it's just like, this was some Mongolian herder\nguy who was taken as a slave and he was like dirt poor,\ncatching rats as a young teen to feed him and his mom\nand I think his brother. And it's just like the odds, when he was born, he was just one of\nprobably tens of thousands of random teen boys living\nin Mongolia in the 1200s. The odds of that person, any one of them being\na household name today that we're talking about, it's just crazy, like what had to happen. And for that guy, for\nthat poor dirt poor herder to take over the world, I don't know. So history just like\ncontinually blows my mind. - And he's the reason you\nand I are related probably. - Yeah, no, I mean, it's\nalso that's the other thing is that some of these\ndudes, by becoming king, by having a better army at the right time, William the Conqueror or\nwhatever is in the right place at the right time, at the right army, and there's a weakness at the right moment and he comes over and he exploits it and ends up probably having,\nI don't know, 1,000 children, and those children are high up people who maybe have a ton of. The species is different\nnow because of him. Forget England's different, or European borders look different. We look different because of\na small handful of people. Sometimes I think I'm like, oh, you know, this part of the world, I can\nrecognize, someone's Greek, someone's Persian, someone's wherever, because they kind of have\ncertain facial features. And I'm like, it may have happened. I mean, obviously it's not\nthat it's a population, but it may be that someone 600 years ago that looked like that\nreally spread their seed, and that's why the ethnicity\nlooks kind of like that now. Sorry, anyway. - Yeah, yeah, do you think\nindividuals like that can turn the direction of history, or is that an illusion that\nnarrative would tell ourselves? - Well, it's both. I mean, so I said, William\nthe Conqueror, right, or Hitler, right? It's not that Hitler was born and destined to be great at all, right? I think in a lot of cases,\nhe's some frustrated artist with a temper who's turning\nover the table in his studio and hitting his wife\nand being kind of a dick and a total nobody, right? I think almost all the times you could have put Hitler baby on Earth. He's a rando, right? Maybe sometimes he becomes some kind of, he uses this speaking ability 'cause that ability was\ngonna be there either way, but maybe he uses it for something else. But that said, I also think,\nbut it's not that World War II was gonna happen either way, right? So it's both, these\ncircumstances were one way and this person came\nalong at the right time and those two made a match\nmade in this case, hell. - But it makes you wonder,\nyes, it's a match in hell, but are there other people that\ncould have taken this place or do these people that stand out, they're the rare spark of that genius whether it take us towards\nevil, towards good, whether those figures\nsingularly define the trajectory of humanity. What defines the trajectory of\nhumanity in the 21st century, for example, might be the influence of AI, might be the influence of nuclear\nwar, negative or positive, not in the case of nuclear\nwar, but the bioengineering, nanotech, virology, what else is there? Maybe the structure of\ngovernments and so on, maybe the structure of universities. I don't know, there could be\nsingular figures that stand up and lead the way for human.\n- There will be. There will be. - But I wonder if the society\nis the thing that manifests that person or that person\nreally does have a huge impact. - I think it's probably a spectrum where there are some cases\nwhen a circumstance was such that something like what\nhappened was gonna happen. And if you pluck that\nperson from the Earth, I don't know whether the Mongols\nis a good example or not, but maybe it could be that if you plucked Genghis Khan as a baby, there was because of the\nspecific way Chinese civilization was at that time, and the specific climate that was causing a certain kind\nof pressure on the Mongols, and the way they still\nhad their great archers, and they had their horses, and they had a lot of the same advantages, so maybe it was waiting to happen, right? It was gonna happen either way, and it might not have happened\nto the extent or whatever. So maybe, or you could go the\nfull other direction and say, actually, this was\nprobably not gonna happen. And I think World War II is an example. I kind of think World War II\nreally was kind of the work of, of course, it relied on all\nthese other circumstances. You had to have the resentment in Germany. You have to have the Great Depression. But like, I think if you take Hitler out, I'm pretty sure World\nWar II doesn't happen. - Well then, it seems like\neasier to answer these questions when you look at history,\neven recent history, but let's look at now, I'm sure we'll talk about social media. So who are the key\nplayers in social media? Mark Zuckerberg, what's the\nname of the MySpace guy, Tom? - [Tim] Tom, it's just Tom, yeah. - There's a meme going around where like MySpace is like\nthe perfect social media 'cause no algorithmic involvement. Everybody's happy and positive. - Also, Tom did it right. At the time, we were like, oh, man, Tom only made like a few million dollars. Oof, he sucks to not be Zuck. Tom might be living a nice life right now where he doesn't have this nightmare that these other people have. - Yeah, and he's always\nsmiling, his profile pic. - [Tim] He looks up. - And then so there's like\nLarry Page, so with Google, that's kind of intermingled\ninto that whole thing, into the development of the internet. Jack Dorsey, now Elon, who else? I mean, there's people playing with the evolution of social media, and to me, that seems to be connected to the development of AI, and it seems like those singular figures will define the direction\nof AI development and social media development, with social media seeming\nto have such a huge impact on our collective intelligence. - It does feel in one way like individuals have an especially big impact right now in that a small number of people are pulling some big levers. And there can be a little meeting of three people at Facebook, and they come out of that\nmeeting and make a decision that totally changes the world. On the other hand, you\nsee a lot of conformity. They all pulled the plug\non Trump the same day. So that suggests that\nthere's some bigger force that is also kind of driving them, in which case it's less\nabout the individuals. I think this is, what is leadership? To me, leadership is the ability to move things in a direction that the cultural forces are\nnot already taking things. A lot of times people seem like a leader because they're just kind of\nhopping on the cultural wave and they happen to be the\nperson who gets to the top of it and now it seems like they're, but actually the wave was already going. Real leadership is when someone\nactually changes the wave, changes the shape of the wave. I think Elon with SpaceX and with Tesla, genuinely shaped a wave. Maybe you could say\nthat EVs were actually, they were gonna happen anyway, but there's not much evidence about at least happening when it did. If we end up on Mars, you can say that Elon was\na genuine leader there. And so there are examples now. Zuckerberg definitely has\ndone a lot of leadership along the way. He's also potentially\nkind of caught in a storm that is happening and he's\none of the figures in it. So I don't know. - And it's possible\nthat he is a big shaper if the metaverse becomes a reality. If in 30 years we're all\nliving in a virtual world, to many people it seems ridiculous now that was a poor investment. Well, he talked about getting 10, I think it was something\nlike a billion people with a VR headset in their pocket in by, I think it was 10 years\nfrom now back in 2015. So we're behind that. But when he was talking\nabout that, and honestly, this is something I've been wrong about 'cause I went to one of\nthe Facebook conferences and tried out all the new Oculus stuff. And I was pretty early talking to some of the major players there 'cause I was gonna write\na big post about it that then got swallowed by this book. But I would have been wrong in the post because what I would have\nsaid was that this thing is, when I tried it, some of them make you nauseous\nand they're just not that, the headsets were big. But I was like, the times\nwhen this is good, it is, It reminds me of the feeling I had when I first was five and\nI went to a friend's house and he had Nintendo. And he gave me the controller and I was looking at the screen and I pressed a button and Mario jumped. And I said, I can make the\nsomething on the screen move. And the same feeling I had the\nfirst time someone showed me how to send an email really early and he's like, you can send\nthis, and I was like, it goes, I can press enter on my computer and something happens on your computer. Those were obviously,\nwhen you have that feeling it often means you're\nwitnessing a paradigm shift. and I thought this is one of those things, and I still think it is but\nit's weird that it hasn't. Where's the VR revolution? - Yeah, I'm surprised,\n'cause I'm with you. My first and still\ninstinct is this feels like it changes everything. VR, it feels like it changes everything, but it's not changing anything, - A dumb part of my brain\nis genuinely convinced that it's real, and then the\nsmart part knows it's not, but that's why the dumb part was like, we're not walking off that cliff. The smart part's like, you're\non your rug, it's fine. The dumb part of my brain's like, I'm not walking off the cliff. So I was like, it's crazy. - I feel like it's waiting\nfor that revolutionary person that who comes in and says,\nI'm gonna create a headset. Honestly, I got- - [Tim] Yeah, it's Steve Jobs' iPhone. - Honestly, a little bit\nof a Karmak type guy, which is why it was really interesting for him to be involved with Facebook. It's basically, how do we\ncreate a simple dumb thing that's 100 bucks, but actually\ncreates that experience, and then there's going to be\nsome viral killer app on it, and that's going to be\nthe gateway into a thing that's gonna change everything. I mean, I don't know what\nexactly was the thing that changed everything\nwith a personal computer. Does that understood why\nthat, maybe graphics? What was the use case? - I mean.\n- Exactly. - Wasn't the 84 Macintosh like\na moment when it was like, this is actually something\nthat normal people can and want to use? - 'Cause it was less than $5,000, I think, because it's almost- - And I just think it had some like Steve Jobs user\nfriendliness already to it that other ones hadn't had. I think Windows 95 was a really big deal. 'Cause I'm old enough\nto remember the MS-DOS when I was like, kind\nof remember the command, and then suddenly this concept of like a window you drag something into, or you double click an icon, which now seems so obvious to us, was revolutionary, 'cause\nit made it intuitive. I don't know, yeah. - Windows 95 was good. - [Tim] It was crazy, yeah. - I forget what the big leaps was, 'cause Windows 2000 sucked,\nand then Windows XP was good. - I moved to Mac around\n2004, so I stopped. - I sold your soul to the devil. I see. Well, us, the people still\nuse Windows and Android, the device and the operating\nsystem of the people, not you elitist folk, with your books, and your, what else, and success. Okay. (chuckles) You write, \"more technology\nmeans better good times, but it also means badder bad times. And the scary thing is, if the good and bad keep\nexponentially growing, it doesn't matter how great\nthe good times become. If the bad gets to a certain level of bad, it's all over for us.\" Can you elaborate on this? Why does the bad have that property? That if it's all exponentially\ngetting more powerful, then the bad is gonna win in the end? Is my misinterpreting that into- - No. So the first thing is, I noticed a trend, which was like, the centuries, the good is getting better every century. The 20th century was the best century yet, in terms of prosperity, in\nterms of GDP per capita, in terms of life expectancy,\nin terms of poverty and disease, and every\nmetric that matters. The 20th century was incredible. It also had the biggest wars in history, the biggest genocide in history, the biggest existential threat\nyet with nuclear weapons. The depression was probably\nas big an economic, so it's this interesting thing, where the stakes are getting\nhigher in both directions. And so the question is,\nif you get enough good, does that protect you against the bad? The dream, and I do think\nthis is possible too, is the good gets so good. Have you ever read the Culture\nSeries, the Iain Banks books? - Not yet, but I get\ncriticized on a daily basis by some of the mutual folks we\nknow for not having done so. And I feel like a lesser man for it, yes. And I feel strange. - So that's how I got onto it, and I read six of the 10\nbooks, and they're great. But the thing I love about them is like, it just paints one of\nthese futuristic societies where the good has gotten so good that the bad is no longer even an issue. Basically, and the way\nthat this works is the AI, the AIs are benevolent, and\nthey control everything. And so there's one random\nanecdote where they're like, what happens if you murder someone? 'Cause there's still people\nwith rage and jealousy or whatever, so someone murders someone, first of all, that person's backed up, so it's like they have to get\na new body, and it's annoying, but it's not death. And secondly, that person,\nwhat are they gonna do? Put them in jail? No, no, no, they're just gonna\nsend a Slap drone around, which is this little tiny random drone that just will float around\nnext to them forever, and by the way, kind of be their servant. It's kind of fun to have a Slap drone, but they're just making sure\nthat they never do anything. And it's like, I was like, oh, man! It could just be,\neveryone could be so safe. And everything could be so\nat like, you want a house, the A-heads would build your house. There's endless space,\nthere's endless resources. So I do think that that\ncould be part of our future. That's part of what excites me is, today would seem like a\nutopia to Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson's world\nwould seem like a utopia to a caveman. There is a future, and by the way, these are happening faster. These jumps, right? So the thing that would\nseem like a utopia to us, we could experience in\nour own lifetimes, right? Especially if life extension combines with exponential progress. I wanna get there. And I think in that part\nof what makes it utopia is you don't have to be as\nscared of the worst bad guy in the world trying to do the worst damage because we have protection. But that said, I'm not\nsure how that happens. It's easier said than done. Nick Bostrom uses the\nexample of if nuclear weapons could be manufactured by\nmicrowaving sand, for example, we probably would be in\nthe Stone Age right now because 0.001% of people would love to destroy\nall of humanity, right? Some 16-year-old with huge\nmental health problems who right now goes and\nshoots up a school would say, oh, even better, I'm\ngoing to blow up a city. And now suddenly there's copycats, right? As our technology grows, it's going to be easier\nfor the worst bad guys to do in tremendous damage. And it's easier to destroy than to build. So it takes a tiny, tiny\nnumber of these people with enough power to do bad. So that to me, I'm like,\nthe stakes are going up 'cause what we have to lose\nis this incredible utopia, but also dystopia is real, it happens. The Romans ended up in a dystopia. They probably earlier thought\nthat was never possible. We should not get cocky. And so to me, that trend\nis the exponential tech is a double-edged sword. It's so exciting. I'm happy to be alive now overall because I'm an optimist\nand I find it exciting, but it's really scary. And the dumbest thing we\ncan do is not be scared. Dumbest thing we can do\nis get cocky and think, well, my life is always the\nlast couple of generations, everything's been fine. Stop that. - What's your gut? What percentage of trajectories take us, as you put, unimaginably good future versus unimaginably bad future? As an optimist. - It's really hard to know. I mean, one of the things we\ncan do is look at history. And on one hand, there's a lot of stories. I'm actually listening to a\ngreat podcast right now called \"The Fall of Civilizations.\" And it's literally every episode is like a little like two-hour deep dive into some civilizations. Some are really famous,\nlike the Roman Empire. Some are more obscure, like\nthe Norse and Greenland. But each one is so interesting. But there's a lot of\ncivilizations that had their peak. There's always the peak, right, when they're thriving and they're max size and they have their waterways. It's civilized and it's representative and it's fair and whatever, not always, but the peak is great. If I could go back in time, it's not that the farther you\ngo back, the worse it gets. No, no, no, you wanna go back\nto a civilization during, I would go to the Roman\nEmpire in the year 100. Sounds great, right? You don't wanna go to the\nRoman Empire in the year 400. - We might be in the peak right now, here, whatever this empire is. - Honestly, I think about\nthe '80s, the '70s, the '80s. - [Lex] Oh, here we go, the\nmusic is so much better. - The '80s culture is so annoying. It's just like when I\nlisten to these things, I'm thinking the '80s and the '90s. America, the '90s was popular. People forget that now. Clinton was a superstar around the world. Michael Jordan was\nexported internationally, then basketball was everywhere suddenly. You had music, the sports whatever. It was a little probably like the '50s coming out of the World\nWar and the depression. Before it, it was this kind\nof everyone's in a good mood kind of time. It's like a finish a big\nproject, and it's Saturday. I feel like the '50s was like\neveryone was having the '20s, I feel like everybody was\nin a good mood randomly, then the '30s everyone was in a bad mood. But the '90s, I think we'll\nlook back on it as a time when everyone was in a good mood. And it was like, again, at the time, doesn't feel that way\nnecessarily, but I look at that and I'm like maybe that\nwas kind of America's peak and maybe not but it hasn't been popular since really worldwide. It's gone in and out\ndepending on the country but it hasn't reached that level of America's awesome around the world and the political you know\nsituation has gotten really ugly and maybe it's social\nmedia maybe who knows but I wonder if it'll ever be as simple and positive as it was then. It feels a little maybe\nwe're in the beginning of the downfall or not, it's not a perfect smooth hill, it goes up and down up and down, so maybe there's another big upcoming. - It's unclear whether public opinion which is what you're talking\nto is correlated strongly with influence. You could say that even though\nAmerica has been on a decline in terms of public opinion\nthe exporting of technology that America has still\nwith all the talk of China has still been leading\nthe way in terms of AI, in terms of social media, in terms of just basically\nany software related product. - [Tim] Like chips. - Yeah, chips, so hardware and software, I mean America leads the way. You could argue that Google and Microsoft and Facebook are no\nlonger American companies, they're international companies but they really are still\nat the headquartered in Silicon Valley broadly\nspeaking, and Tesla of course. And just all the technological innovation still seems to be happening\nin the United States although culturally and politically, it's not good. Well, maybe that could shift at any moment when all the technological development can actually be create\nsome positive impact in the world that could shift it. With the right leadership and so on, with the right messaging. - Yeah, I think, I don't\nfeel confident at all. No, no, I don't mean that, I don't mean I don't feel\nconfident in my opinion that we may be on the downswing\nor that we may be outside, I truly don't know it's\nlike I think the people, these are really big macro stories that are really hard to see\nwhen you're inside of them. It's like being on a beach and running around a few miles this way and trying to suss out the\nshape of the coastline. It's just really hard\nto see the big picture. You get caught up in the micro stories, the little tiny ups and downs that are part of some bigger trend. And also, giant paradigm\nshifts happen quickly nowadays. The internet came out of\nnowhere and suddenly was like, changed everything. So there could be a\nchange everything thing on the way it seems like\nthere's a few candidates for it. But it feels like the\nstakes are just high. Higher than it even was for the Romans. Higher than it was because we were more\npowerful as a species. We have God-like powers with technology that other civilizations\nat their peak didn't have. - I wonder if those high stakes and powers will feel laughable\nto people that live humans, aliens, cyborgs, whatever\nlives 100 years from now. That maybe this feeling of political and technological turmoil\nis nothing compared to like. - Well, that's the big question. So right now, the 1890s was like a super politically\ncontentious decade in the US. It was like immense tribalism and the newspapers were\nall lying and telling. There was a lot of what we would associate with today's media, the worst of it. And it was over gold or silver being this. I don't know. It's something that I don't understand. But the point is it was a\nlittle bit of a blip, right? It happened. It felt it must have felt like\nthe end of days at the time. And then now we most people\ndon't even know about that versus, again, the Roman\nEmpire actually collapsed. And so the question is just like is, yeah, in 50 years will\nthis be like McCarthyism? Oh, that was like a crazy\nfew years in America and then it was fine. Or is this the beginning\nof something really big? - Well, why I wonder if we can predict what the big thing is at the beginning. It feels like we're just\nhere along for the ride. And at the local level,\nand at every level, I try to do our best. - Well, how do we do our best? The one thing I know for sure, is that we need to have our wits about us and do our best and the\nway that we can do that. We have to be as wise as possible, right, to proceed forward. And wisdom is an emergent\nproperty of discourse. - So you're a proponent\nof wisdom versus stupidity 'cause I can steal man\nthe case for stupidity. - [Tim] Do it. - (chuckles) I probably can't. But there's some, I think,\nwisdom and you talk about this, can come with a false confidence? Arrogance, I mean, you talk\nabout this in the book. That's too easy to lose.\n- That's not wisdom. If you're being arrogant,\nyou're being unwise. - [Lex] Unwise? - Yeah, I think wisdom is\ndoing what people 100 years from now with at the\nhindsight that we don't have, would do if they could come back in time and they knew everything. It's like, how do we figure out how to have hindsight\nwhen we actually are not- - What if stupidity is the thing that people from a hundred\nyears from now will see as wise? The idiot by Dostoyevsky being naive and trusting everybody, maybe that's what- - Well, then you get lucky. Then maybe you get to a good\nfuture by stumbling upon it. But ideally, you can get there. I think a lot of the America, the great things about it are a product of the wisdom of previous Americans. The constitution was a\npretty wise system to set up. - There's not much\nstupid stumbling around. Well, there is, I mean, with\nDostoyevsky's \"The Idiot,\" Prince Michigan, and Brothers Karmasov, there's Alyosha Karmasov,\nyou err on the side of love and almost like a naive\ntrust in other human beings. And that turns out to be,\nat least in my perspective, in the long term, for the\nsuccess of the species, is actually wisdom. - It's a compass.\n- But we don't know. I'm sorry.\n- It's a compass when you're in the fog. - In the fog.\n- It's a compass, yeah. - (chuckles) Love is a compass. - Okay, but here's the thing. I think compass is nice. But you know what else is nice? It's a flashlight in the fog. You can't see that far, but you can see, oh, you can see four feet\nahead instead of one foot. And that to me is discourse. That is open, vigorous\ndiscussion in a culture that fosters that, is how the species, is how the American citizens as a unit can be as wise as possible. Can maybe see four feet ahead\ninstead of one foot ahead. - That said, Charles Bukowski said that, love is a fog that fades with\nthe first light of reality. So I don't know how that works out, but I feel like there's intermixing\nof metaphors that works. Okay, you also write that quote, as the authors of the story of us, which is this thousand page book, \"we have no mentors, no editors, no one to make sure it all turns out okay. It's all in our hands. This scares me, but\nit's also gives me hope. If we can all get just\na little wiser together, it may be enough to nudge\nthe story onto a trajectory that points towards an\nunimaginably good future.\" Do you think we can possibly define what a good future looks like? I mean, this is the\nproblem that we ran into with communism of thinking of utopia, of having a deep confidence about what a utopian world looks like. - Well, it's a deep confidence. That was a deep confidence\nabout the instrumental way to get there. I think a lot of us can agree that if everyone had everything they needed and we didn't have disease or poverty and people could live as\nlong as they wanted to and choose when to die, and there was no major existential\nthreat 'cause we control, I think almost everyone can\nagree that would be great. They said, this is the way to get there and that's a different question. So the unimaginably good\nfuture I'm picturing, I think a lot of people would picture and I think most people would\nagree, no, not everyone. There's a lot of people out there who would say humans are\nthe scourge on the earth and we should degrowth or something. But I think a lot of\npeople would agree that, just, again, take Thomas\nJefferson, bring him here. He would see it as a\nutopia for obvious reasons, for the medicine, the\nfood, the transportation, just how the quality of life\nand the safety and all of that. So extrapolate that forward for us. Now we were Thomas Jefferson,\nwhat's the equivalent? That's what I'm talking about. And the big question is, I don't try to say, here's\nthe way to get there. Here's the actual\nspecific way to get there. I try to say, how do we have a flashlight so that we can together figure it out? How do we give ourselves the\nbest chance of figuring out the way to get there? And I think part of the problem with communists and people is, ideologues is that they're\nway too overconfident that they know the way to get there. And it becomes a religion\nto them, this solution. And then you can't update\nonce you have a solution as a religion and so. - I felt a little violated when you said communists\nstare deeply into myself. In this book, you've developed a framework for how to fix everything. It's called the ladder. Can you explain it? - [Tim] Okay, it's not a framework for how to fix everything,\nI would never say that. - I'll explain it to\nTim Urban at some point. - Okay. - How this humor thing works.\n- Yeah, no. - The framework of how to\nthink about collaboration between humans such that\nwe could fix things. - I think, it's a compass. It's a ruler that we can, once we look at it together\nand see what it is, we can all say, oh, we want to\ngo to that side of the ruler. Not this side. And so it gives us a direction to go. - And so what are the parts of the ladder? - So I have these two characters. This orange guy, this primitive mind is, this is our software. That is the software that was\nin a 50,000 BC person's head that was specifically optimized to help that person survive in that world. And not really survive, but help them pass their\ngenes on in that world. And civilization happened quickly\nand brains changed slowly. And so that unchanged dude\nis still running the show in our head. And I use the example of like Skittles. Why do we eat Skittles? It's trash, it's obviously bad for you. And it's because the\nprimitive mind in the world that it was programmed\nfor, there was no Skittles. And it was just fruit. And if there was a dense,\nchewy, sweet fruit like that, it meant you just found\nlike a calorie gold mine. Energy, energy, take it, take it. Eat as much as you can. Gorge on it. Hopefully you get a little fat. That would be the dream. And now we're so good\nwith energy for a while. We don't have to stress about it anymore. So today, Mars Inc. is clever and says, let's not sell things to\npeople's higher minds, who's the other character. Let's sell the people's primitive minds. Primitive minds are dumb. And let's trick them into thinking this thing you should eat,\nand then they'll eat it. Now Mars Inc. is a huge company. - Actually, just to linger real quick. See, you said primitive\nmind and higher mind. So those are the two things\nthat make up this bigger mind that is the modern human being. - Yeah, it's not perfect. Obviously, there's a lot of crossover. Maybe there's people who will yell at me for saying there's two minds. But to me, it is still\nin a useful framework where you have this software\nthat has making decisions based on a world that you're not in anymore. And then you've got this other character. I call it the higher mind. And it's the part of you that knows that Skittles are not good\nand can override the instinct. And the reason you don't\nalways eat Skittles is 'cause the higher mind says, no, no, no, we're not doing that because that's bad,\nand I know that, right? Now you can apply that to a lot of things. The higher mind is the one that knows I shouldn't procrastinate. The primitive mind is the one\nthat wants to conserve energy and not do anything icky\nand can't see the future. So he procrastinates\nthat, you can apply this. No, in this book apply it\nto how we form our beliefs is one of the ways and\nthen eventually to politics and political movements. If you think about, well,\nwhat's the equivalent of the Skittles tug of war in your head for how do you form your beliefs? And it's that the\nprimitive mind in the world that it was optimized for, it wanted to feel conviction\nabout its beliefs. It wanted to feel conviction and it wanted to agree with\nthe people around there, didn't want to stand out and wanted to perfectly\nagree with the tribe about the tribe's sacred beliefs. And so there's a big part\nof us that wants to do that. That doesn't like changing your mind. The primitive mind\nidentifies with beliefs. It feels like it's a threat,\na physical threat to you, to your primitive mind\nwhen you change your mind or when someone disagrees\nwith you in a smart way. So there's that huge force in\nus which is confirmation bias, that's where that comes from. It's this desire to keep\nbelieving what we believe and this desire to also\nfit in with our beliefs to believe what the\npeople around us believe. And that can be fun in some ways, we all like the same sports\nteam and we're all super into it and we're all gonna be biased\nabout that call together. I mean, it's not always bad, but, it's not a very smart way to be. And actually, you're working\nkind of for those ideas, those ideas are like your boss. And you're working so hard\nto keep believing those. Those ideas are really good\npaper comes in that you read that conflicts with those ideas and you will do all this work\nto say that paper is bullshit because you're a faithful\nemployee of those ideas. Now, the higher mind,\nto me, the same party that can override the\nSkittles, can override this and can search for something\nthat makes a lot more sense, which is truth, 'cause what rational being wouldn't want to know the truth. Who wants to be delusional? And so there's this tug of war because the higher mind\ndoesn't identify with ideas. Why would you? It's an experiment you're\ndoing, and it's a mental model. And if someone can come\nover and say, you're wrong, you'd say, where, where? Show me, show me. And if they point out\nsomething that is wrong, you say, oh, thanks. Oh, good, I just get a\nlittle smarter, right? You're not gonna identify with the thing. Oh, yeah, kick it, see\nif you can break it. If you can break it, it's\nnot that good, right? So there's both of these in our heads. And there's this tug of war between them. And sometimes, if you're telling\nme about something with AI, I'm probably gonna think\nwith my higher mind 'cause I'm not identified with it. But if you go and you criticize\nthe ideas in this book or you criticize my religious\nbeliefs or you criticize, I might have a harder time\nbecause the primitive mind says, no, no, no, those are our special ideas. And so yeah, so that's one\nway to use this ladder, it's a spectrum. At the top, the higher mind\nis doing all the thinking. And then as you go down, it\nbecomes more of a tug of war. And at the bottom, the primitive\nmind is in total control. - And this is distinct as you show from the spectrum of ideas. So this is how you think\nversus what you think. And those are distinct, those\nare different dimensions. - We needed a vertical axis. We have all these horizontal\naxes left, right center, or this opinion, all\nthe way to this opinion. What's much more important than where you stand is how you\ngot there and how you think. So if I can say, this\nperson's kind of on the left or on the right, but they're\nup high, in other words, I think they got there\nusing evidence and reason and they were willing\nto change their mind. Now, that means a lot to\nme what they have to say. If I think they're just a tribal person, and I can predict all their\nbeliefs from hearing one because it's so obvious\nwhat political beliefs, that person's views are irrelevant to me because they're not real. They didn't come from information, they came from a tribe's\nsacred Ten Commandments. - I really like the comic you\nhave in here with the boxer. \"This is the best boxer in the world.\" \"Wow, cool, who has he beaten?\" \"No one, he's never fought anyone.\" \"Then how do you know he's\nthe best boxer in the world?\" \"I can just tell.\" I mean, this connects with me and I think with a lot of people just 'cause in martial arts\nit's especially kind of true. There's this whole legend\nabout different martial artists and that we construct action figures, thinking that Steven Seagal is\nthe best fighter in the world or Chuck Norris. But Chuck Norris is actually backed up. He has done really well in competition, but still the ultimate test\nfor particular for martial arts is what we now know is mixed\nmartial arts, UFC and so on. And that's the actual\nscientific testing ground. - It's a meritocracy.\n- Yeah, exactly. I mean, there's within certain rules and you can criticize those rules. This doesn't actually\nrepresent the broader combat that you would think of when you're thinking about martial arts. But reality is you're\nactually testing things. And that's when you realize that Aikido and some of these kind\nof woo woo martial arts in their certain\nimplementations don't work in the way you think they would\nin the context of fighting. I think this is one of the places where everyone can agree which is why it's a really nice comic. Map this onto ideas that\npeople take personally. It starts becoming a lot more difficult to basically highlight\nthat we're thinking with, not with our higher mind,\nbut with our primitive mind. - Yeah, I mean, if I'm\nthinking with my higher mind and now here, you can use\ndifferent things for an idea as a metaphor. So here, the metaphor is a boxer for one of your conclusions,\none of your beliefs. And if all I care about\nis truth, in other words, that means all I care about\nis having a good boxer. I would say, go, yeah, try,\nsee if this person's good. In other words, I would\nget into arguments, which is throwing my boxer out there to fight against other ones. And if I think my argument\nis good, by the way, I love boxing. If I think my guy is amazing,\nMike Tyson, I'm thinking, oh, yeah, bring it on,\nwho wants to come see? I bet no one can beat my boxer. I love a good debate, right, in that case. Now, what would you think about my boxer if not only was I\ntelling you he was great, but he's never boxed\nanyone, but then you said, okay, well, your idea came\nover to try to punch him and I screamed and I\nsaid, what are you doing? That's violence and you're an awful person and I don't wanna be\nfriends with you anymore 'cause you would think\nthis boxer obviously sucks, or at least I think it sucks deep down because why would I be so anti? Anyone, no boxing allowed. So this, I call this a ladder, right? If you're in low rung land, whether it's a culture or\nwhatever, a debate, an argument when someone says, no,\nthat's totally wrong, what you're saying about\nthat and here's why. You're actually being totally biased. It sounds like a fight. People are gonna say, oh,\nwow, we got in a fight. It was really awkward. Are we still friends with that person? Because it's not a culture of boxing. It's a culture where you don't\ntouch each other's ideas. That's insensitive. Versus in a high rung\nculture, it's sports. Every one of your podcasts, whether you're agreeing or disagreeing, the tone is the same. It's not like, oh, this got awkward. The tone is identical 'cause you're just playing\nintellectually either way 'cause it's a good, high-rung spin. - That is best, but people\ndo take stuff personally. And then that's actually one\nof the skills of conversation just as a fan of podcasts is, when you sense that people\ntake a thing personally, if there's sort of methodologies and the little paths you can\ntake to like calm things down. Go around, don't take it as\na violation of like that. - You're trying to suss out which of their ideas are sacred to them. And which ones are, bring it on. - And sometimes it's actually, I mean, that's the skill of it I suppose, that sometimes it's a certain wardings in the way you challenge\nthose ideas are important. You can challenge them indirectly and then walk together in that way. Because what I've learned\nis people are used to their ideas being\nattacked in a certain way, in a certain tribal way. And if you just avoid those, like for example, if you\nhave political discussions and just never mentioned left or right or Republican and Democrat, none of that. Just talk about different ideas and avoid certain kind\nof triggering words. You can actually talk about ideas versus falling into this path that's well established through battles that people have previously thought. - When you say triggering, I\nmean who's getting triggered? The primitive mind. So what you're trying to do, what you're saying in this language is, how do you have conversations with other people's higher minds, almost like whispering without\nwaking up the primitive mind? - [Tim] Yeah, exactly. - Primitive mind is there sleeping, right? And as soon as you say something the left primitive\nmind gets up and says what, what are you saying about the left? And now that everything\ngoes off the rails? - What do you make of conspiracy theories under this framework of the letter? - So here's the thing\nabout conspiracy theories is that once in a while\nthey're true, right? 'Cause sometimes there's\nan actual conspiracy. Actually, humans are pretty\ngood at real conspiracies, secret things, and then I just\nwatched the \"Made Off\" doc, great new Netflix doc, by the way. And so the question is, how do you create a\nsystem that is good at, you put the conspiracy theory\nin, and it either goes, eh, or it says, is interesting,\nlet's keep exploring it. How do you do something that\nit can, how do you assess it? And so, again, I think the Hiran culture is really good at it,\nbecause a real conspiracy, what's gonna happen, it's\nlike a little machine you put in the middle of the table, and everyone starts firing darts at it, or bow and arrow, or whatever, and everyone starts\nkicking it, and trying to, and almost all conspiracy theories, they quickly crumble, right? Because they actually,\nTrump Selection won, and I actually dug in, and\nI looked at every claim that he or his team made, and it was like, none of\nthese hold up to scrutiny. None of that, it was open-minded,\nbut none of them did. So that that was one that as\nsoon as it's open to scrutiny, it crumbles. The only way that\nconspiracy can stick around in a community is if it is a culture where that's being\ntreated as a sacred idea that no one should kick or throw a dart at because if you throw a\ndart, it's gonna break. And so what you want is a\nculture where no idea is sacred. Anything can get thrown at\nit, so I think that then, what you'll find is that 94\nout of 100 conspiracy theories come in and they fall down. The other, maybe four\nof the others come in and there's something there, but it's not as extreme as people say. And then maybe one is a huge deal and it's actually a real conspiracy. - Well, isn't there a lot of gray area and there's a lot of mystery? Isn't that where the\nconspiracy theories seep in? So it's great to hear\nthat you've really looked into the Trump election fraud claims, but aren't they resting on\na lot of kind of gray area, like fog, basically saying\nthat there is dark forces in the shadows that are\nactually controlling everything. I mean, the same thing, there's like safer conspiracy theories, less controversial ones, like\nhave we landed on the moon? All right, did the United\nStates ever land on the moon? The reason those conspiracy theories work is you could construct, there's\nincentives and motivation for faking the moon landing. There's very little data\nsupporting the moon landing. That's very public and looks fake, space counts, fake, kind of. - [Tim] Yeah, that would be a big story if it turned out to be fake. - That would be the argument against it. Are people really as a\ncollective going to hold on to a story that big? Yeah, but the reason they\nwork is there's mystery. - Yeah, it's a great documentary called \"Behind the Curve\" about flat-Earthers. And one of the things that\nyou learn about flat-Earthers is they believe all the conspiracies, not just the flat Earth. They are convinced the\nmoon landing is fake. They're convinced 9-11\nwas an American con job. Name a conspiracy and they believe it. And so it's so interesting, is that I think of it as\na skepticism spectrum. So on one side, it's like\na filter in your head, filter in the belief\nsection of your brain. On one end of the\nspectrum, you are gullible, perfectly gullible, you\nbelieve anything someone says. On the other side, you're paranoid, you think everyone's lying to you. Everything is false, nothing\nthat anyone says is true. So obviously, those\naren't good places to be. Now, the healthy place, so I think the healthy\nplace has to be somewhere in the middle, but also you can learn\nto trust certain sources and then you don't have to apply\nas much skepticism to them. But when you start having a bias, just so you have a political bias. When your side says something,\nyou will find yourself moving towards the gullible side of the spectrum. You read an article written\nthat supports your views, you move to the gullible\nside of the spectrum and you just believe it\nand you don't have any, where's that skepticism that\nyou normally have, right? And then you move, and then as soon as it's\nthe other person talking, the other team talking,\nyou move to the skeptical, the closer to the in denial paranoid side. Now flat-Earthers are the extreme. They are either at 10 or one. It's so interesting\nbecause they're the people who are saying, ah, no,\nI won't believe you. I'm not gullible. No, everyone else is gullible\nabout the moon landing. I won't. And then yet when there's\nthis evidence like, oh, because you can't see Seattle, you can't see the\nbuildings over that horizon and you should, which isn't true. You should be, if there were earth around you wouldn't be able to see them. Therefore. So suddenly the become\nthe most gullible person hear any theory about the\nearth flat they believe it. He was right into their beliefs. So they're actually jumping back and forth between physics to believe\nanything and believe anything. And so they're the extreme example. But I think when it comes\nto conspiracy theories, the people that get\nthemselves into trouble, they become really gullible when they hear a conspiracy theory that kind of fits with their worldview. And they likewise, when there's something\nthat's kind of obviously true and it's not a big lie,\nthey'll think it is. They just tighten up\ntheir skepticism filter. And so, yeah, so I think\nthe healthy places to be is where you are not, 'cause you also don't wanna\nbe the person who says, every conspiracy, you hear\nthe word conspiracy theory and it sounds like a synonym for like, quack job crazy theory, right? So yeah, so I think, yeah, I think it'd be somewhere in\nthe middle of that spectrum and to learn to fine tune it. - Which is a tricky place to operate, 'cause every time you hear\na new conspiracy theory, you should approach it with an open mind. And also if you don't have\nenough time to investigate, which most people don't,\nkind of still have a humility not to make a conclusive\nstatement that that's nonsense. - There's a lot of social\npressure, actually, to immediately laugh off\nany conspiracy theory, if it's done by the bad guys, right? You will quickly get mocked and laughed at and not taken seriously. If you give any credence, back\nto lab leak was a good one, where it's like, turned out that that was at least very\ncredible, if not true. And that was a perfect example of one when it first came out, and not only so, so Brett Weinstein talked about it. And then I, in a totally\ndifferent conversation, said something complimentary about him on a totally different subject. And people were saying, \"Tim, you might've gone a\nlittle off the deep end. You're like quoting someone\nwho is like a lab leak person.\" So, I was getting my reputation dinged for complimenting on a different topic someone whose reputation\nwas totally sullied because they questioned\nan orthodoxy, right? So you see. So what does that make me wanna do? Distance myself from Brett Weinstein. That's the, at least they see incentive. And what does that make\nother people wanna do? Don't become the next Brett Weinstein. Don't say it out loud, because you don't wanna become someone that no one wants to\ncompliment anymore, right? You can see the social pressure. And of course, when there is a conspiracy, that social pressure is its best friend. - Because then they see the\npeople from outside are seeing that social pressure\nenact like a Tim Urban becoming more and more and\nmore extreme to the other side. And so they're going to\ntake the more and more and more extreme. I mean, what do you see\nthat the pandemic did, that COVID did to our\ncivilization in that regard, in the forces? Why was it so divisive? Do you understand that? - Yeah, so COVID, we always know the\nultimate example of a topic that will unite us all\nas the alien attack. Although honestly, I don't\neven have that much faith. Then I think there'd be like,\nsome people are super like, pro alien and some people are anti alien. But anyway. - I was actually, sorry to interrupt, 'cause I was talking to a few astronomers and they're the first folks\nthat made me kind of sad in that if we did discover life\non Mars, for example, that there's going to be\npotentially a division over that too where half\nthe people will not believe that's real. - Well, because we live\nin a current society where the political divide\nhas subsumed everything. And that's not always like that. It goes into stages like that. We're in a really bad one where\nit's actually, in the book, I call it like a vortex,\nlike almost like a whirlpool that pulls everything into it. It pulls, and so normally\nyou'd have to say, okay, immigration naturally\ngonna be contentious. That's always political, right? But like COVID seemed like, oh, that's one of those\nthat will unite us all. Let's fight this not human virus thing. Obvious is no one's sensitive. No one's like getting hurt\nwhen we insult the virus. Let's all be, we have this\nthreat, this common threat that's a threat to every\none of every nationality in every country, every ethnicity. And it didn't do that at all. The whirlpool was too powerful. So it pulled COVID in and suddenly masks. If you're on the left, you like them. If you're on the right, you hate them. And suddenly lockdowns. If you're on the left, you like them. And on the right, you hate them. And vaccines, people will forget this. When Trump first started\ntalking about the vaccine, Biden, Harris, Cuomo, they're all saying, I'm not taking that\nvaccine, not from this CDC. - Because those two rushed\nor something like that. - I'm not trusting\nanything that Trump says. Trump wants me to take\nit, I'm not taking it. I'm not taking it from this CDC. Trump was almost out of\noffice, but at the time, if Trump had been, I'm pretty\nsure it would have stayed. Right likes vaccines, the\nleft doesn't like vaccines. Instead, the president switched. And all those people are suddenly saying, they were actually specifically saying that if you're saying the\nCDC is not trustworthy, that's misinformation, which is exactly what they were\nsaying about the other CDC. And they were saying it because they genuinely didn't\ntrust Trump, which is fair. But now, when other people\ndon't trust the Biden CDC, suddenly it's this kind of misinformation that needs to be censored. So, it was a sad moment\nbecause it was a couple months, even a week or so, I mean, a month or so at the very beginning when it felt like a lot\nof our other squabbles were like, oh, I feel like\nthey're irrelevant right now. And then very quickly, the\nwhirlpool sucked it in. And in a way where I think\nit damaged the reputation of these, a lot of the trust\nin a lot of these institutions for the long run. - But there's also an\nindividual psychological impact. It's like a vicious\nnegative feedback cycle where they were deeply\naffected on an emotional level and people just were\nnot their best selves. - That's definitely true. Yeah, I mean, talk about\nthe primitive mind. I mean, one thing that\nwe've been dealing with for our whole human history is pathogens. And it's emotional, right? It brings out, there's\nreally interesting studies where they studied the\nphenomena of disgust, which is one of these\nsmiling is universal. You don't have to ever\ntranslate a smile, right? Certain, throwing your hands\nup when your sports team wins is universal because\nit's part of our coding. And so is disgust to\nkind of make this face where you wrinkle up your nose and put out your tongue\nand maybe even gag. That's to expel, expel whatever's\n'cause it's the reaction when something is potentially a pathogen that might harm us, right? Feasties, vomit, whatever, but they did this interesting study where people who, in two\ngroups, the control group, was shown images of, and I might be getting\ntwo studies mixed up, but they were showing\nimages of car crashes and disturbing but not disgusting. And the other one was\nshowing rotting things and just sort of things\nthat were disgusting. And then they were\nasked about immigration, these were Canadians. And the group that had\nthe disgust feeling, pulsing through their body\nwas way more likely to prefer immigrants from white countries. And the group that had just\nbeen shown car accidents, they still prefer the\ngroups from white countries, but much less so. And so, what does that mean? It's because the disgust\nimpulse makes us scared of sexual practices that are foreign, of ethnicities that don't look like us, it stokes xenophobia, so it's ugly. It's really ugly stuff. The Nazi propaganda with cockroaches, or it was, Rwandan was\ncockroaches, the Nazis was rats, and, specifically, it's\na dehumanizing emotion. So anyway, we were talking about\nCOVID, but I think it does, it taps deep into the human psyche. And I don't think it brings\nout, I think, like you said, I think it brings out an ugly side in us. - You describe an ideal lab as being opposite of echo chambers. So we know what echo chambers are and you said there's\nbasically no good term for the opposite of an echo chamber. So what's an ideal lab. - Well, first of all, both of these, we think of an echo\nchamber as a group maybe or even a place, but it's a culture, it's an intellectual culture. And this goes along with the high-rung, so high-rung and low-rung\nthinking is individual. That's what I was talking about, what's going on in your head. But this is very connected to\nthe social scene around us. And so groups will do high rung and low rung thinking together. So an echo chamber to me is a collaborative low rung thinking. It's a culture where the cool, it's based around a sacred set of ideas. And it's the coolest thing you can do in an echo chamber culture is talk about how great the sacred ideas are and how bad and evil and\nstupid and wrong the people are who have the other views. And it's quite boring, it's quite boring because it's very hard to learn and changing your mind is not cool in an echo chamber culture,\nit makes you seem wishy washy, it makes you seem like you're waffling and you're flip-flopping or whatever, showing conviction about the sacred ideas in echo chamber culture is\nawesome if you're just like, obviously this makes you seem smart while being humble makes you seem dumb. So now flip all of those\nthings on their heads and you have the opposite\nwhich is idea lab culture which is collaborative high rung thinking. It's collaborative truth finding but it's just a totally different vibe. It's a place where arguing is a fun thing, no one's getting offended and criticizing like the\nthing everyone believes is actually it makes you\nseem like interesting like, oh, really, why do you\nthink we're all wrong and expressing too much conviction makes people lose trust in you. It doesn't make you seem smart, it makes you seem stupid\nif you don't really know what you're talking about but\nyou're acting like you do. - I really like this diagram of where on the x-axis agreement\non the y-axis is decency, that's in an idea lab in an echo chamber there's only one axis, it's\nasshole to non-asshole. - [Tim] Right. - This is a really important\nthing to understand about the difference between,\nyou call it decency here, about assholishness and disagreement. - So my college friends,\nwe love to argue, right? And no one thought anyone\nwas an asshole for, it was just for sports. Sometimes we'd realize\nwe're not even disagreeing on something and that would\nbe disappointing and be like, oh, I think we agree. And it was kind of like sad, it was like, oh, well, there goes the fun. And one of the members\nof this group has this, she brought her new boyfriend\nto one of our hangouts and there was like a\nheated, heated debate, just one of our typical things. And afterwards, the next day,\nhe said, is everything okay? And she was like, what do you mean? And he said, after the fight\nand she was like, what fight? And he was like, the fight last night. And she was like, you\nmean like the arguing? And he was like, yeah. And so that's someone who was not used to idea lab culture coming into it. And seeing it, this is like,\nare they still friends, right? And idea lab is nice\nfor the people in them 'cause individuals thrive. You don't wanna just conform. It makes you seem boring in an idea. But you wanna be yourself. You wanna challenge things. You wanna have a unique brain. So that's great. And you also have people\ncriticizing your ideas, which makes you smarter. It doesn't always feel good, but you become more correct and smarter. And echo chamber is the opposite, where it's not good for the people. And you're learning skills atrophy. And I think it's boring. But the thing is, they also\nhave emergent properties. So the emergent property of an ideal lab is like super intelligence. Just you and me alone. Just the two of us. If we're working together on something, but we're being really grown up about it. We're disagreeing. No one's sensitive about anything. We're gonna each find flaws\nin the other one's arguments that you wouldn't have found on your own. And we're going to have\ndouble the epiphanies, right? So it's almost like the\ntwo of us together is like as smart as 1.5. It's like 50% smarter than\neither of us alone, right? So you have this 1.5\nintelligent kind of joint being that we've made. Now bringing a third person\nin, fourth person in, right? You see, it starts to scale up. This is why science institutions\ncan discover relativity and quantum mechanics and these things that no individual human was gonna come up without a ton of collaboration because it's this giant ideal lab. So it has an emergent property\nof super intelligence. And echo chamber is the opposite, where it has the emergent\nproperty of stupidity. I mean, it has the emergent property of a bunch of people all paying fealty to this set of sacred ideas. So you lose this magical thing\nabout language and humans, which is collaborative intelligence, you lose it, it disappears. - But there is that access of decency, which is really interesting\n'cause you painted this picture of you and your friends\narguing really harshly. But underlying that is a\nbasic camaraderie, respect, there's all kinds of mechanisms\nwe humans have constructed to communicate, like mutual\nrespect, or maybe communicate that you're here for the\nideal lab version of this. - Totally, you don't get personal, right? You're not getting personal, you're not taking things personally. People are respected in an ideal lab and ideas are disrespected. - And there's ways to signal that. So with friends, you've\nalready done the signaling, you've already established a relationship. The interesting thing is online, I think you have to do some of that work. I mean, to me, sort of\nsteelmanning the other side, or no, having empathy and hearing out, being able to basically\nrepeat the argument the other person is making before you and showing like respect to that argument. I could see how you could think that before you make a counter argument. There's just a bunch\nof ways to communicate that you're here not to do\nkind of, what is it, low rung, shit talking, mockery, derision, but are actually here\nultimately to discover the truth and the space of ideas and\nthe tension of those ideas. And I think that's a skill that we're all learning as a civilization of how to do that kind of\ncommunication effectively. 'Cause I think disagreement, as I'm learning on the internet, it's actually a really tricky skill. Like high effort, high\ndecency disagreement. There's a really good debate podcast, \"Intelligence Squared.\" And they can go pretty hard in the paint. - [Tim] It's a classic idea lab. - Exactly, but how do we\nmap that to social media? When people will say,\nwell, Lex or anybody, you hate disagreement. You wanna censor disagreement. No, I love Intelligence\nSquared type of disagreement. That's fun. - You wanna reduce assholes. - And for me personally, I\ndon't want to reduce assholes. I like assholes, it's fun in many ways. But the problem is when the\nasshole shows up to the party, they make it less fun for the party that's there for the idea lab. And the other people,\nespecially the quiet voices at the back of the room, they leave. And so all you're left is with assholes. - Well, political Twitter to\nme is one of those parties. It's a big party where a few\nassholes have really sent a lot of the quiet thinkers away. And so if you think\nabout this graph again, a place like Twitter, a\ngreat way to get followers is to be an asshole with a certain, pumping a certain ideology. You'll get a huge amount of followers. And for those followers, and\nthe followers you're gonna get, the people who like you are\nprobably going to be people who are really thinking\nwith their primitive mind because they're seeing\nyou're being an asshole, but because you agree\nwith them, they love you. And they think they don't see any problem with how you're being. - [Tim] Yeah, they don't see the asshole. This is a fascinating thing because of- - Because look at the thing on the right. Agreement and decency are the same. So if you're in that mindset, the bigger the asshole, the better. If you're agreeing with me, you're my man, I love what you're saying. Yes, show them, right? And the algorithm helps those people. Those people do great on the algorithm. - There's a fascinating\ndynamic that happens 'cause I have currently hired somebody that looks at my social\nmedia and they block people because the assholes will roll in. They're not actually there to have an interesting\ndisagreement, which I love. They're there to do kind of mockery. And then when they get blocked, they then celebrate that\nto their echo chamber, like, look at this, I got\nthem, or whatever they do. - Or they'll say some annoying thing like, oh, so he talks about, if\nI'd done this, they'll say, oh, he says he likes idea labs, but he actually wants to\ncreate an echo chamber. I'm like, nope, you're an asshole. Look at the other 50 people on this thread that disagreed with me respectfully. They're not blocked.\n- Yep, exactly. - And so they see it as\nsome kind of hypocrisy because, again, they only\nsee the thing on the right. And they're not understanding\nthat there's two axes, or that I see it as two axes. And so you seem petty in\nthat moment, but it's like, no, no, no, this is very\nspecific what I'm doing. You're actually killing the conversation. - And generally, I give\nall those folks a pass and just send them love telepathically, but yes, getting rid of\nassholes in the conversation is the way you allow for the disagreement. - You do a lot of, I think, when primitive-mindedness comes\nat you, at least on Twitter, I don't know what you're feeling\ninternally in that moment, but you do a lot of, I'm gonna meet that with my higher mind. And you come out and you'll be like, thanks for all the criticism, I love you. And that's actually an amazing response because what it does is that it unriles up that person's primitive mind and actually wakes up\ntheir higher mind who says, oh, okay, this guy's not so bad. And suddenly, civility comes back. So it's a very powerful and very powerful. - Hopefully long-term, but the thing is, they do seem to drive away\nhigh-quality disagreement 'cause it takes so much effort to disagree in a high-quality way. - I've noticed this on my blog. One of the things I pride myself on is my comment section is awesome. Everyone's being respectful. No one's afraid to disagree with me and say, tear my post apart,\nbut in a totally respectful way where the underlying thing is like, I'm here 'cause I like\nthis guy in his writing and people disagree with each other and they get in these long\ninterviews and it's interesting and I read it and I'm learning. And then a couple posts, especially the ones I've\nwritten about politics, it seems like any other comment section, people are being nasty to me, they're being nasty to each other. And then I looked down one of them and I realized like almost all of this is the work of like three people. That's who you need to block. Those people need to be blocked. You're not being thin skinned. You're not being petty doing it. You're actually protecting an idea lab, because what really\naggressive people like that do is they'll turn it into\ntheir own echo chamber, because now everyone is scared\nto kinda disagree with them, just so it's unpleasant, and\nso people who'll chime in or the people who will agree with them, and suddenly they've taken over the space. - And I kinda believe that those\npeople, on a different day, could actually do\nhigh-effort disagreement. It's just that they're in\na certain kind of mood, and a lot of us, just like you\nsaid, with a primitive mind, could get into that mood. I believe it's actually\nthe job of the technology, the platform, to incentivize\nthose folks to be like, are you sure this is the best you can do? Like if you really wanna\ntalk shit about this idea, do better. And then we need to create incentives where you get likes for\nhigh effort disagreement. 'Cause currently you\nget likes for something that's slightly funny and\nis a little bit mockery. Yeah, basically signals to\nsome kind of echo chamber that this person is a horrible\nperson, is a hypocrite, is evil, whatever. That feels like it's\nsolvable with technology. 'Cause I think in our private\nlives, none of us want that. - I wonder if it's making\nme think that I wanna like, because a much easier way for me to do it just for my world would\nbe to say something like, here's this axis, this\nis part of what I like about the latter, it's a\nlanguage that we can use, specifically what we're talking about is high rung disagreement, good,\nlow rung disagreement, bad. Right, and so it gives\nus a language for that. And so what I would say is I would have my readers\nunderstand this axis, and then I would specifically\nsay something like, please do it but why a favor. And upvote regardless of what\nthey're saying horizontally, right, regardless of what\ntheir actual view is. Upvote high rungness. They can be tearing me apart. They can be saying great. They can be praising me, whatever. Upvote high-rungness\nand down-low-rungness. And if enough people are doing that, suddenly there's all this\nincentive to try to say, no, I need to calm my emotion down here and not get personal\nbecause I'm gonna get voted into oblivion by these people. - I think a lot of people\nwould be very good at that. And not only would they be good at that, they would want that, that task of saying, I know I completely\ndisagree with this person, but this was a high-effort,\nhigh-rung disagreement. - And gets everyone thinking\nabout that other axis too. You're not just looking at\nwhere do you stand horizontally? You're saying well how did you get there and are you treating ideas like machines? Are you treating them like little babies? - And there should be\nsome kind of labeling on personal attacks\nversus idea disagreement. Sometimes people throw\nin both a little bit. And it's like no, there\nshould be a disincentive at personal attacks versus idea attacks. - Well, one metric is a\nrespectful disagreement. Just say someone else's Twitter. And I see, you put out a thought. And I see someone say, I don't see it that way. Here's where I think you went wrong, and they're just explaining. I'm thinking that if Lex reads that, he's gonna be interested. He's gonna wanna post more stuff, right? He's gonna like that. If I see someone being like, wow, this really shows the\nkind of person that you become. It shows something. I'm thinking that person\nis making Lex want to be on Twitter less. It's making him, and\nso what is that doing. What that person is actually doing is they're chilling discussion. They're making it scary\nto say what you think. And the first person isn't at all. The first person is making\nyou wanna say more stuff. And those are both disagreed. Those are people who\nboth disagree with you. - Exactly, exactly. Great disagreeing with\nfriends in MeetSpace, they disagree with you. They could be even yelling at you. Honestly, they could\neven have some shit talk or it's like personal attacks,\nit is still feels good. - Because you know them well and you know that that shit talk 'cause I guess your friends\nshould talk all the time playing us playing a sport or a game and again because they know\neach other well enough to know that this is fun, we're having fun. And obviously, I love you.\n- Yeah, exactly. - And that's important\nonline, it's a lot harder. - Yeah, that obviously, I\nlove you that underlies a lot of human interaction.\n- Right. - Seems to be easily lost online. I've seen some people\non Twitter and elsewhere just behave their worst. I know that's not who you are. Who is this human? - I know someone personally\nwho is one of the best people. - [Tim] Yeah. - I love this guy. One of the best, fun, funny, nicest dudes. If you looked at this Twitter only, you'd think he's a culture worrier, or an awful culture worrier. And biased, and stoking anger. And it comes out of a good place. And I'm not gonna give any\nother info about specific, but it comes out- - [Lex] I think you're\ndescribing a lot of people this. - It comes out of a good place because he really cares about what he, but it's just, I can't square the two. Once you know someone like\nthat, you can realize, okay, apply that to everyone. 'Cause a lot of these\npeople are lovely people. Even just back in the before social media. They had this dickishness on text or email that they didn't have in person. And you're like, wow, email\nyou is like kind of a dick. And certain people have\na different persona behind the screen. - It has, for me personally,\nhas become a bit of a meme that \"Lex blocks with love.\" But there is a degree\nto that where this is, I don't see people on\nsocial media as representing who they really are. I really do have love for them. I really do think\npositive thoughts of them throughout the entirety of the experience. I see this as some weird side effect of online communication. And so to me, blocking is not\nsome kind of a derisive act towards that individual. It's just like saying- - Well, a lot of times what's\nhappened is they have slipped into a very common delusion\nthat dehumanizes others. So that doesn't mean they're a bad person. We all can do it, but\nthey're dehumanizing you or whoever they're being nasty to, because in a way they\nwould never do in person, because in a person they're\nreminded that's a person. Remember I said the dumb part of my brain when I'm doing VR won't\nstep off the cliff, but the smart part of my brain\nknows I'm just on the rug? That dumb part of our brain is\nreally dumb in a lot of ways. It's the part of your brain where you can set the\nclock five minutes fast to help you not be late. The smart part of your brain\nknows that you did that, but the dumb part will fall for it, right? That same dumb part of\nyour brain can forget that the person behind that screen, that behind that handle is\na human that has feelings, and that doesn't mean they're a bad person for forgetting that, 'cause it's possible. - But this really interesting idea, and I wonder if it's\ntrue that you're right, is that both primitive mindedness and high mindedness tend to be contagious. I hope you're right, that it's possible to\nmake both contagious, 'cause our popular intuition is only one of the primitive mindedness is contagious, as exhibited by social media. - To compliment you again, don't you think that your\nTwitter to me is like, I was just looking down. And I mean, it's just high-mindedness, it's just high-mindedness\ndown, down, down, down, down. It's gratitude. It's optimism. It's love. It's forgiveness. It's all these things that\nare the opposite of grievance and victimhood and resentment\nand pessimism, right? And there's I think a reason\nthat a lotta people follow you because it is contagious. It makes other people feel those feelings. - I don't know. I've been recently, over\nthe past few months, attacked quite a lot, and\nit's fascinating to watch because it's over things that, I think I probably have\ndone stupid things, but I'm being attacked for things that are totally not worthy of attack. I got attacked for a book list. - [Tim] I saw that, by the\nway, I thought it was great. - But you can always kind of find ways, I guess the assumption is, this person surely is a fraud\nor some other explanation. He sure has dead bodies in the basement and he's hiding or something like this. And then I'm going to construct\na narrative around that and mock and attack that. I don't know how that\nworks, but there does, and I think you write this in the book, there seems to be a gravity pulling people towards the primitive mind. - But when it comes to\nanything political, right? Religious, certain things are\nbottom heavy, for our psyche, they have a magnet that\npulls our psyches downwards on the ladder. And why? Why does politics pull our\npsyches down on the ladder? Because for the tens of thousand years that we were evolving\nduring human history, it was life or death. Politics was life or death. And so there's actually an\namazing study where it's like, they challenged 20 different\nbeliefs of a person and different parts of the person's brain, and then you had an MRI going, different parts of the\nperson's brain lit up when nonpolitical beliefs were challenged versus political beliefs were challenged. When political beliefs were challenged, when nonpolitical beliefs were challenged, like the rational, like the\nprefrontal cortex type areas were lit up. When the political\nbeliefs were challenged, and then I'm getting over my head here, but it's like the parts of your brain the default mode network. The parts of your brain\nassociated with introspection and your own identity were lit up. And they were much more\nlikely to change their mind on all the beliefs, the\nnonpolitical beliefs. When that default mode network\npart of your brain lit up, if anything, get more\nfirm in those beliefs when you had them challenged. So politics is one of those topics that just literally lights up\ndifferent part of our brain. Again, I think we come\nback to primitive mind, higher mind here. This is one of the things our primitive mind comes\nprogrammed to care a ton about. And so it's gonna be very\nhard for us to stay rational and calm and looking for truth because we have all this gravity. - Well, it's weird because\npolitics, like what is politics? To talk about, it's a\nbunch of different issues. And each individual issue,\nif we really talk about, we don't-\n- It attacks policy, like why are we being\nemotional about this? - I don't think we're\nactually that, I mean, yeah, we're emotional about something else. - Yeah, I think what we're\nemotional about is this, my side, the side I've\nidentified with is in power and making the decisions and\nyour side is out of power. And if your side's in power,\nthat's really scary for me 'cause that goes back to the idea of who's pulling the strings\nin this tribe, right? Who's the chief? Is it your family's\npatriarch or is it mine? You might not have food\nif we don't win this, kind of whatever, chief election. So I think that it's\nnot about the tax policy or anything like that. And then it gets tied to this broader, I think a lot of our tribalism has really coalesced around this. We don't have that much\nreligious tribalism in the US, right, now they know the Protestants and the Catholics hate each other, we don't have that really, right? And honestly say we have racial\ntribalism and everything, but a white, even a racist,\nwhite conservative guy, I think takes the Black conservative over the woke white person\nany day of the week right now. - [Lex] So that's the strongest source of the division.\n- It tells me that I think it's the strongest, way stronger tribalism right now. I think that white racist guys, loves the Black conservative guy compared to the white woke guy, right? So it's, again, not that\nracial tribalism isn't a thing, of course it's always a thing, but like political tribalism\nis the number one right now. - So race is almost a topic\nfor the political division versus the actual sort\nof element of the tribe. - [Tim] It's a political football, yeah. - I mean, this is dark. So this is a book about\nhuman civilization, this is a book about human nature, but it's also a book of\npolitics, about politics. It is just the way you\nlist it out in the book, it's dark how we just fall into these left and right checklists. So if you're on the left, it's maintain, where we weighed\nuniversal healthcare good, mainstream media fine, guns kill people, US as a racist country, protect\nimmigrants, tax cuts bad, climate change awful, raise minimum wage. And on the right is the flip of that, reverse where we weighed\nuniversal healthcare bad, mainstream media bad, people kill people, not guns kill people. US was a racist country,\nprotect borders, tax cuts good, climate change, overblown,\ndon't raise minimum wage. I mean, you almost don't have\nto think about any of this, it's literally- - So when you say it's\na book about politics, it's interesting 'cause it's a\nbook about the vertical axis. It's specifically not a book about the horizontal axis in that, I don't actually talk\nabout any of these issues. I don't put out an opinion on them, those are all horizontal, right? So rather than having another\nbook about those issues, about right versus left, I wanted to do a book\nabout this other axis. And so on this axis, the\nreason I had this checklist is that this is a part of\nthe low rung politics world. Low rung politics is a checklist. And that checklist evolves, right? Like Russia suddenly is like popular with the right as opposed to,\nit used to be in the '60s, the left was the one defending Stalin. So they'll switch, it doesn't even matter, the substance doesn't matter, it's that this is the approved checklist of the capital P party and\nthis is what everyone believes. That's a low rung thing. The high rungs, this\nis not what it's like. High rung politics, you tell\nme your one view on this? I have no idea what you think\nabout anything else, right? And you're gonna say I don't\nknow about a lot of stuff because inherently, you're not gonna have that strong an opinion because\nyou don't have that much, these are complex things. So there's a lot of I don't know and people are all over the place. You know you're talking to someone who has been subsumed\nwith low-rung politics when if they tell you their opinion on any one of these issues, you know you could just\nrattle off their opinion on every single other one. And if in three years\nit becomes fashionable to have this new view,\nthey're gonna have it. You're not thinking, that's\necho chamber culture. - And I've been using kind\nof a shorthand of centrist to describe this kind\nof high-rung thinking, I mean, it seems to be\ndifficult to be a centrist or whatever, a high-rung thinker. People want to label you as a person who's too cowardly to take stands somehow. As opposed to saying, I don't\nknow is a first statement. - Well, the problem with\ncentrist is that would mean that in each of these, tax\ncuts bag, tax cuts good. It means that you are saying, I am in, I think we should have some\ntax cuts, but not that many. You might not think that. You might actually do some\nresearch and say, actually, I think tax cuts are really important. That doesn't mean, oh, I'm\nnot a centrist anymore. I guess I'm a far, no, no, no. That's why we need the second axis. So what you're trying to be, when you say centrist is high-rung, which means you might be all\nover the place horizontally. You might agree with the\nfar-left on this thing, the far-right on this thing, you might agree with the\ncentrists on this thing, but calling yourself a centrist\nactually is putting yourself in a prison on the horizontal axis. And it's saying that whatever,\non the different topics, I'm right and between the two policy-wise. That's not where you are. So yeah, that's why we're\nbadly missing this other axis. - Yeah, I mean, I still do\nthink it's just like for me, I am a centrist when you project\nit down to the horizontal. But the point is you're\nmissing so much data by not considering the vertical. On average, maybe it falls\nsomewhere in the middle. But in reality, there's just\na lot of nuance issue to issue that involves just thinking\nand uncertainty and changing and given the context of\nthe current geopolitics and economics, and just\nalways considering, always questioning, always\nevolving your views, all of that. - Not just about, oh, I think we should be in the center on this, but\nanother way to be in the center is if there's some phenomenon happening, there's a terrorist attack. And one side wants to say, this has nothing to do with Islam. And the other side wants to say, this is radical Islam, right? What's in between those? It's saying this is complicated and nuanced and we have to learn more and it probably has\nsomething to do with Islam and something to do with\nthe economic circumstances and something to do with geopolitics. So in the case like that, you actually do get really a nuance when you go to the extremes. And all of that nuance, which is where all the truth usually is, is going to be in the middle, so, yeah. - But there's a truth to the fact that if you take that\nnuance on those issues, like were in Ukraine, COVID, you're going to be attacked by both sides. - Yes. People who are really\nstrongly on one side strongly on one side or the other,\nhate centrist people. I've gotten this myself, and the slur that I've had thrown at me is I'm an enlightened centrist\nin a very mocking way. So what are they actually saying? What does enlightened centrist mean? It means someone who is, Stephen Pinker, Jonathan Haidt gets accused of this. That they're highfalutin,\nintellectual world, and they don't actually take a side, they don't actually get their hands dirty, and they can be superior to both sides without actually taking a stand, right? So I see the argument,\nand I disagree with it, because I firmly believe\nthat the hardcore tribes, they think they're taking a stand and they're out in the streets and they're pushing for something. I think what they're doing is they're just driving the\nwhole country downwards, and I think they're hurting\nall the causes they care about. And so it's not that we need\neveryone to be sitting there and refusing to take a side, it's that you can be\nfar left and far right, the upper left and upper right. - If we talk about the, you\nuse the word liberal a lot in the book to mean something that we don't in modern\npolitical discourse mean. So it's this higher philosophical view. And then you use the words\nprogressive to mean the left and conservative to mean the right. Can you describe the\nconcept of liberal games and power games? - So the power games is what I call, basically just the laws of nature, when laws of nature are\nthe laws of the land, that's the power game. So animals, watch any\nDavid Attenborough special. And when the little lizard is running away from the bigger animal or whatever, I use an example of a bunny in a bear. I don't even know if bears eat bunnies. They probably don't, but\npretend bears eat bunnies. So in the power games, the\nbear is chasing the bunny. There's no fairness. There's no, okay, well, what's right? What's legal? No, no, if the bear is fast\nenough, it can eat the bunny. And if the bunny can get\naway, it can say living. So that's it, that's the only rule. Now humans have spent a\nlot of time in essentially that environment. So when you have a\ntotalitarian dictatorship and so what's the rule of the power games? It's everyone can do whatever they want if they have the power to do so. It's just a game of power. So if the bunny gets away, the\nbunny actually has more power than the bear in that situation. And likewise the\ntotalitarian dictatorship, there's no rules that dictator\ncan do whatever they want. They can torture, they\ncan flatten a rebellion with a lot of murder because\nthey have the power to do so. What are you gonna do, right? And that's kind of the state of nature. That's our natural way. When you watch a mafia movie, we do a lot of it, we have it in us. We all can snap into power games mode when it becomes all about\njust actual raw power. Now, the liberal games is\nsomething that civilizations for thousands of years\nhave been working on. It's not invented by\nAmerica or modern times, but America's was the\nlatest crack at it yet, which is this idea instead of\neveryone can do what they want if they have the power to do so, it's everyone can do what they want as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. Now that's really complicated,\nhow do you define harm? And the idea is that\neveryone has a list of rights which are protected by the government. And then they're inalienable rights and those are protected again from an invasion by other people. And so you have this fragile balance. And so the idea with the liberal games is that there are laws,\nbut it's not totalitarian. They will build very clear, strict laws around the edges of what\nyou can and can't do. And then everything else, freedom. So unlike a totalitarian dictatorship, actually it's very loose. There's a lot of things can happen and it's up to the people,\nbut there are still laws that protect the very\nbasic inalienable rights and stuff like that. So it's this much looser thing. Now the vulnerability there, so the benefits of it are obvious, right? Freedom is great. It seems like it's the most fair. That equality of opportunity\nseem like the most fair thing. And equality before the law, due process and all of this stuff. So it seems fair to the founders of the US and other enlightenment thinkers. And it also is a great way to\nmanifest productivity, right? You have Adam Smith saying, it's not from the\nbenevolence of the butcher or the baker that we get our dinner, but from their own self-interest. So you can harness kind of\nselfishness for progress. But it has a vulnerability,\nwhich is that because the laws, it's like totalitarian laws, they don't have an excess\nof laws for no reason. They wanna control everything. And in the US we say,\nthey're not gonna do that. And so the second, it's\nalmost two puzzle pieces. You have the laws, and then\nyou've got a liberal culture. Liberal laws have to be\nmarried to liberal culture, a defense of liberal spirit in order to truly have the\nliberal games going on. And so that's vulnerable\nbecause free speech, you can have the First\nAmendment, that's the laws part. But if you're in a culture where anyone who speaks out against orthodoxy is going to be shunned from the community, well, you're lacking the second\npiece of the puzzle there. You're lacking liberal culture. And so therefore, you might as well not even\nhave the First Amendment. And there's a lot of examples like that where the culture has to do its part for the true liberal games to be enjoyed. So it's just much more complicated, much more nuanced than the power games. It's a set of basic laws that then are coupled with a basic spirit to create this very\nawesome human environment that's also very vulnerable. - So what do you mean the\nculture has to play along? So for something like a\nfreedom of speech to work, there has to be a basic, what, decency? That if all people are perfectly good, then perfect freedom without\nany restrictions is great. It's where the human nature\nstarts getting a little iffy. We start being cruel to each other. We start being greedy and desiring of harm and also the narcissists and sociopaths and psychopaths in society. All of that, that's when you start to have to inject some limitations\non that freedom. - Yeah, I mean, so what the government basically says is we're going to let\neveryone be mostly free, but no one is gonna be free to\nphysically harm other people or to steal their property, right? And so we're all agreeing to sacrifice that 20% of our freedom\nand then in return, all of us in theory can be 80% free and that's kind of the bargain. But now that's a lot of\nfreedom to leave people with and a lot of people choose, it's like you're so free in the US, you're actually free to\nbe unfree if you choose. That's kind of what an\necho chamber is to me. You can choose to be friends with people who essentially make it so\nuncomfortable to speak your mind that it's no actual\neffective difference for you than if you lived in a country. If you can't criticize Christianity\nin a certain community, that you have a First Amendment, so you're not gonna get\narrested by the government for criticizing Christianity. But if the social penalties are so extreme that it's just never worth it, you might as well be in a country that imprisons people for\ncriticizing Christianity. And so that same thing\ngoes for wokeness, right? This is what people get,\ncancel culture and stuff. So when the reason these things are bad is because they're depriving Americans of the beauty of the\nfreedom of the liberal games by imposing a social culture\nthat is very power games-esque. It's basically a power\ngames culture comes in and you might as well be\nin the power games now. If you live in a liberal democracy, there will always be challenges\nto a liberal culture, lowercase L, liberal. There'll always be challenges\nto a liberal culture from people who are much more interested in playing the power games. And there has to be an immune system that stands up to that culture and says, that's not how we do things\nhere in America, actually. We don't excommunicate people for not having the right\nreligious beliefs or not rent. We don't disinvite a speaker from campus for having the wrong political beliefs. And if it doesn't stand up for itself, it's like the immune system\nof the country failing and power games rushes in. - So before chapter four in your book and the chapters that will surely result in you being burned at\nthe stake, you write, \"we'll start our pitchfork\ntour in this chapter by taking a brief trip to the history of the Republican party. Then in the following chapters, we'll take a Tim's\ncareer tanking deep dive into America's social justice movement,\" as you started to talk about. Okay, so let's go. What's the history of\nthe Republican party? - I'm looking at this\nthrough my vertical ladder. I'm saying, what is this familiar story of the Republicans from the '60s to today, what does it look like through\nthe vertical lens, right? Does it look different? And is there an interesting\nstory here that's been hidden 'cause we're always\nlooking at the horizontal. Now the horizontal story,\nyou'll hear people talk about it and they'll say something\nlike the Republicans have moved farther and\nfarther to the right. And to me, that's not really true. Was Trump more right wing than Reagan? I don't think so. I think he's left. Yeah. So we're using this, again, it's just like you're\ncalling yourself centrist when it's not exactly what you\nmean, even though it also is. So again, I was like, okay,\nthis vertical lens helps with other things. Let's apply it to the Republicans. And here's what I saw\nis, I looked at the '60s and I saw an interesting story,\nwhich I don't think that, not everyone's familiar with what happened in the early '60s, but in 1960, the Republican\nparty, it was a plurality. You had progressives, genuine Rockefeller, pretty progressive people, then you had the moderates\nlike Eisenhower and Dewey. And then you go all the\nway to the farther right, you had Goldwater and what you might call, I call them the fundamentalists. And so it's this interesting\nplurality, right? Something we don't have today. And what happened was\nthe Goldwater contingent, which was the underdog,\nthey were small, right? The Eisenhower was the president, or had just been the president and it seemed like the moderates were, instead you have to be close to the center of the chessboard. That's how you maintain power. These people were very far from the center of the chessboard, but they ended up basically\nhave like a hostile takeover. They conquered their own party and they did it by breaking all of the unwritten rules and norms. So they did things like they first started with the college Republicans, which was like this feeder\ngroup that turned in, a lot of the politicians started there. And they went to the election and they wouldn't let\nthe current president, the incumbent speak and\nthey were throwing chairs and they were fist fights. And eventually people gave\nup and they just sat there and they sat in the chair talking, their candidate until\neveryone eventually left and then they declared victory. So basically they came in, there was a certain set\nof rules agreed upon rules and they came in playing\nthe power games saying, well actually, if we do this,\nyou won't have the power. We have the power to take it if we just break all the rules, right? And so they did, and they won. And that became this\nhugely influential thing, which then they conquered\nCalifornia through, again, these people were taken aback. These proper Republican\ncandidates were appalled by the insults that were\nbeing hurled at them and the intimidation in the building. And eventually they ended up\nin the national convention, which was called the right-wing Woodstock. The Republican National\nConvention in '64 was just, again, there was jeering, and they\nwouldn't let their moderates or their progressives even speak. And there was racism, Jackie Robinson was there and\nhe was a proud Republican. And he said that, he\nfeels like he was a Jew in Hitler's Germany with the way that Blacks were being treated there. And it was nasty, but what did they do? They had fiery plurality\nenough to win, and they won. They ended up getting crushed\nin the general election and they faded away. But to me, I was like, that\nwas an interesting story. I see it as, I have this character in the book called the golem, which is a big, dumb, powerful monster. That's the emergent property of a political echo chambers,\nlike this big giant. It's stupid, but it's powerful and scary. And to me, a golem rose up, conquered the party for a\nsecond, knocked it on its ass, and then faded away. And to me, when I looked at\nthe Trump revolution and a lot, and not just Trump, the last 20 years, I see that same lower right, that lower right monster\nmaking another charge for it, but this time succeeding and\nreally taking over the party for a long period of time. I see the same story, which is the power games are\nbeing played in a situation when it had always been\nthe government relies on all these unwritten\nrules and norms to function. But for example, you have in 2016, Merrick Garland gets nominated by Obama. And the unwritten norm says that when the president\nnominates a justice, then you pass them through unless there's some egregious thing. That's what has happened. But they said, actually,\nthis is the last year of his presidency and\nthe people should choose. I don't think we should\nset a new precedent where the president can't nominate people, nominate a Supreme Court\njustice in the last year. So they pass it through and\nit ends up being Gorsuch. And so they lose that seat. Now, three years later,\nit's Trump's last year and it's another election\nyear and Ginsburg dies. And what did they say? They say, oh, let's keep our precedent. They said, no, oh, actually\nwe changed our mind. We're gonna nominate Amy Barrett. So to me, that is classic power games. There's no actual rule. And what you're doing is they\ndid technically have the power to block the nomination. And then they technically\nhad the power to put someone and they're pretending\nthere's some principle to it. But they're going for a short-term edge at the expense of what is\nthe workings of the system in the long run. And then one of the Democrats\nhave to do in that situation, 'cause both parties have been doing this, is they either can lose now all the time, or they start playing the power games too. And now you have a prisoner's\ndilemma where it's like, both end up doing this thing\nand everyone ends up worse off. The debt ceiling, all these\npower plays that are being made with these holding the country\nhostage, this is power games. And to me, that's what\nGoldwater was doing in the '60s, but it was a healthier time in a way because there was this plurality within the parties reduced\nsome of the national tribalism. And there wasn't as much\nof an appeal to that. But today, it's just like,\ndo whatever you have to do to beat the enemies. And so I'm seeing a rise in power games. And I talk about the Republicans because they did a lot\nof these things first. They have been a little\nbit more egregious, but both parties have been doing it over the last 20, 30 years. - Can you place blame, or maybe there's a different term for it, at the subsystems of this? So is it the media? Is it the politicians like\nin the Senate, in Congress? Is it Trump? So the leadership? Or maybe it's us, human beings, maybe social media\nversus mainstream media. Is there a sense of what is the cause and what is the symptom? - It's very complex. So Ezra Klein has a great\nbook, \"Why We're Polarized,\" where he talks about a lot of this. And there's some of these are,\nit's really no one's fault. First of all, it's the\nenvironment has changed in a bunch of ways you just mentioned. And what happens when\nyou take human nature, which is a constant and you\nput it into an environment, behavior comes out. The environment's the\nindependent variable. When that changes, the dependent variable, behavior changes with it, right? And so the environment has\nchanged in a lot of ways. So one major one is it used\nto for a long time actually, the first it was the Republicans and then the Democrats just\nhad a stranglehold on Congress. it was not even competitive. The Democrats for 40\nyears had the majority. And so therefore it actually\nis a decent environment to compromise it because now we can both, what you want is Congress people thinking about their home district. And voting yes on a national policy because we're gonna get a\ngood deal on it back at home. That's actually healthy, as opposed to voting in lockstep together because this is what\nthe red party is doing, regardless of what's good\nfor my home district. An example is Obamacare. There were certain Republican districts that would have actually\nofficially been benefited by Obamacare, but every\nRepublican voted against it. And part of the reason is because it's no longer\nthis obvious majority. Every few years it switches,\nit's a 50-50 thing. And that's partially because\nwe've been so subsumed with this one national\ndivide of left versus right, they're voting for the\nsame party for president all the way down the ticket now. And so you have this just\nkind of 50-50 color war and that's awful for compromise. So there's like 10 of these\nthings that have redistricting, but also it is social media. I call it hypercharged tribalism. In the '60s you had distributed tribalism. You had some people that are\nworked up about the USSR. They're national, that's\nwhat they care about. US versus foreign. Some people that were\nsaying left versus right, like they today, and then other people that were saying they were\nfighting within the party. But today you don't have that. You have ideological realignment, so you got rid of a lot\nof the in-party fighting, and then there hasn't been\nthat big of a foreign threat. Not nothing like the USSR for a long time. So you lost that and what's left is just this left versus right thing. And so that's this hypercharged whirlpool that subsumes everything. And so, yeah, I mean, people\npoint to Newt Gingrich, people like there's certain\ncharacters that enacted policies that stoked this thing. But I think this is a much\nbigger environmental shift. - Well, that's going back to our questions about the role of\nindividuals in human history. One of the many interesting\nquestions here is about Trump. Is he a symptom or a cause? Because he seems to be\nfrom the public narrative such a significant catalyst for some of the things we're seeing. - This goes back to what we were talking about earlier, right? Is it the person or is it the times? I think he's a perfect example\nof it's a both situation. I don't think if you plucked\nTrump out of the situation, I don't think that Trump was inevitable. But I think we were very\nvulnerable to a demagogue. And if you hadn't been, Trump\nwould have had no chance. And why were we vulnerable to a demagogue is because you have these, I mean, I think it's specifically on the right. If you actually look at\nthe stats, it's pretty bad. Because it's not just who voted for Trump, a lot of people just\nvote for the red, right? What's interesting is who\nvoted for Obama against Romney and then voted for Trump? These are not racists, right? These are not hardcore Republicans. They voted for Obama. And where did the switch come from? Places that had economic despair. Where bridges were not working\nwell, that's a signifier. Where paints chipping in the schools. These little things like this. So I think that you had this, a lot of these rural towns,\nyou have true despair. And then you also have,\nthe number one indicator of voting for Trump was distrust in media. And the media has become\nmuch less trustworthy. And so you have all these ingredients that actually make us very\nvulnerable to a demagogue. And a demagogue is someone\nwho takes advantage, right? There's someone who comes in and says, I can pull all the right\nstrings and pull it and push all the right\nemotional buttons right now and get my self power by taking advantage of the circumstances. And that is what Trump totally did. - It makes me wonder how\neasy it is for somebody who's a charismatic leader to capitalize on cultural resentment when\nthere's economic hardship to channel that. - So John Haidt wrote\na great article about, truth is in an all time low right now. The media is not penalized\nfor lying, right? MSNBC, Fox News, these are not penalized for being inaccurate or penalized if they stray from the\northodoxy on social media. It's not the truest tweets\nthat go viral, right? And so Trump understood that\nbetter than anyone, right? He took advantage of it. He was living in the current world when everyone else was stuck in the past. And he saw that and he just lied. Everything he said, truth was not relevant at all, right? It's just truly, it's not relevant to him when what he's talking about. He doesn't care and he knew that neither do as a\nsubset of the country. - I was thinking about this, just reading articles by journalists, especially when you're not a\nfamous journalist in yourself, but you're more like in\nyour Times journalist. So the big famous thing is the\ninstitution you're a part of. You can just lie 'cause you're not going\nto get punished for it. You're going to be\nrewarded for the popularity of an article. So if you write 10 articles, there's a huge incentive\nto just make stuff up. - [Tim] You gotta get clicks. - To get clicks. That's the first and foremost. And culturally, people will\nattack that article to say, it's not like one half the\ncountry will attack that article for saying it's dishonest,\nbut they'll kind of forget, you will not have a reputational hit. There won't be a memory like this person made up a\nlot of stuff in the past. No, they'll take one article at a time and they'll attach the reputation hits will be to New York\nTimes, the institution. And so for the individual journalist, there's a huge incentive to make stuff up. - Totally. And it's scary because it's\nalmost like you can't survive if you're just an old\nschool, honest journalist who really works hard\nand tries to get it right and does it with nuance. What you can be is you can\nbe a big time sub-stacker or big time podcaster. A lot of people do have\na reputation for accuracy and rigor and they have huge audiences. But if you're working in\na big company right now, I mean, especially, I think that many of the big media brands are very much controlled by the left but I will say that the\nones that are controlled by the right are even more egregious. Not just in terms of accuracy,\nbut also in terms of, the New York Times, for\nall of its criticisms, they here and there,\nthey put out a pretty, saw an article that strays, Barry Weiss wrote there for a long time, and then they wrote an article\ncriticizing free speech on campus stuff recently, and they have a couple, very left progressive\nfriendly conservatives, but they have conservatives\nthat are operating the op-eds. Fox News, you're not seeing\nthoughtful, Breitbart, you're not seeing thoughtful progressives writing there, right? - There's some degree to which\nthe New York Times, I think, still incentivizes and values\nthe vertical, the high effort. So you're allowed to have\na conservative opinion if you do a really damn good job. Like if it's a very thorough,\nin-depth art kind of. - And if you kind of pander\nto the progressive senses in all the right ways. I always joke that Ted, they always have a couple\ntoken conservatives, but they get on stage and\nthey're basically like, so totally, the progressivism's\nright about all of this, but maybe libertarianism isn't all about, so there is an element, but you know what? It's something, it's better\nthan being a total tribal. I think you can see the\nNew York Times tug of war, the internal tug of war. You can see it, 'cause then they also have\nthese awful instances, or the firing of James Bennett, which is this whole other story. Yeah, you can see it going both ways, but in the '60s, what did you have? You had ABC, NBC, CBS, the '70s, you had these\nthree news channels and they weren't always right, and they definitely sometimes\nspun a narrative together, maybe, about the Vietnam or whatever, but if one of them was just lying, they'd be embarrassed for it. They would be penalized, they'd be dinged, and they'd be known as,\nthis is the trash one. And that would be terrible\nfor their ratings, because they weren't just\ncatering to half the country, they're all catering to the whole country. So, both on the axis of accuracy and on the axis of neutrality, they had to try to stay somewhere\nin the reasonable range, and that's just gone. - One of the things I'm\nreally curious about is I think your book is incredible. I'm very curious to see how\nit's written about by the press. 'Cause I could see, I could myself write, with the help of Chad JPT, of course, clickbait articles in either direction. - [Tim] Yeah, it's easy to imagine. - Your whole book is beautifully written for clickbait articles. If any journalist out there need help, I can help.\n- Yeah. - I can write the most\natrocious criticisms. - Yeah. I'm ready, I'm braced. - Yeah, so, speaking of which, you write about social justice. You write about two\nkinds of social justice, liberal social justice and S.J.F., social justice fundamentalism. What are those? - Yeah, so, the term wokeness\nis so loaded with baggage, it's like mocking and derogatory. And I was trying not to\ndo that in this book. If it's the term loaded with baggage, you're from the first minute,\nyou're already behind. So, to me, also, when\npeople say wokeness is bad, social justice is bad, they're throwing the baby\nout with the bathwater. Because the proudest tradition in the US. is liberal social justice. And what I mean by that, again,\nliberal meaning lowercase L. It is intertwined with liberalism. So, Martin Luther King, classic example, I have a dream speech, he says stuff like, this country has made a\npromise to all of its citizens and it has broken that promise\nto its Black citizens, right? In other words, liberalism,\nthe Constitution, the core ideals, those are great. We're not living up to them,\nwe're failing on some of them. So, civil disobedience, the goal of it wasn't to hurt liberalism, it was to specifically break the laws that were already violating, the laws that were a violation\nof liberalism to expose that this is illiberal. That the Constitution\nshould not have people of different skin color sitting in different parts of the bus. And so, it was really patriotic,\nthe civil rights movement. It was saying, this is a beautiful, we have a liberalism\nis this beautiful thing and we need to do better at it. So, I call it liberal social justice and it used the tools of liberalism to try to improve the\nflaws that were going on. So, free speech, Mario Savio in the '60s, he's a leftist and what the leftist doing in the '60s on Berkeley campus, they were saying we need more free speech because that's what liberal\nsocial justice was fighting for. But you can also go back to\nthe '20s, women's suffrage. I mean, the emancipation, the thing that America\nobviously has all of it, these are all ugly things\nthat it had to get out of, but it got out of them, one by one and it's still getting out of them. That's what's cool about America. And liberal social justice\nbasically is the practice of saying, where are we\nnot being perfect liberals and now let's fix that. - So, that's the idea of liberalism that permeates the history\nin the United States. But then there's interplay, you have so many good images in this book, but one of them is\nhighlighting the interplay of different ideas over the\npast, let's say 100 years. So, liberalism is on one\nside, there's that thread. There's Marxism on the other, and then there's postmodernism. How do those interplay together? - So, it's interesting because Marxism is, and all of its various descendants, obviously there's a lot of\nthings that are rooted in Marxism that aren't the same thing\nas what Karl Marx preached. But what do they all have in common? They think liberalism is bad, right? They actually think that the opposite of what Martin Luther\nKing and other people in the civil rights and other movements, they think the opposite. He thinks liberalism is\ngood we need to preserve it, they said liberalism is the problem. These other problems with racism and inequality that we're seeing, those are inevitable\nresults of liberalism. Liberalism is a rigged game and it's just the power games in disguise. There is no liberal games, it's just the power games in disguise and the upper people that\noppress the lower people and they convince the lower people, it's all about false consciousness. They convince the lower people\nthat everything is fair, and that the lower people vote\nagainst their own interests and they work to preserve the\nsystem that's oppressing them. And what do we need to do? Actually there's much more revolutionary. We need to overthrow liberalism. So people think, what we call a woke-ness is a normal social justice activism but it's like more extreme, right? It's this, no, no, it's the\npolar opposite, polar opposite. Now that's the Marxist threat. Now postmodernism is this term\nthat is super controversial and I don't think anyone calls\nthemselves a postmodernist or take all of this with a grain of salt in terms of the term but what's\nthe definition of radical? The definition of radical to me is how deep you want change to happen at. So a liberal progressive and a conservative progressive\nwill disagree about policies, the liberal progressive wants\nto change a lot of policies. And change, change, change, right? And the conservative is more wants to keep things the way they are. But they're both conservative when it comes to liberalism beneath it, the liberal foundation of the country. They both become conservatives about that. The Marxist is more radical because they want to go one notch deeper and actually overthrow that foundation. Now, what's below liberalism is the core tenets of modernity, this idea of reason and the notion that there is an objective truth and science as the scientific method. These things are actually\nbeneath, and even the Marxist, if you look at the Frankfurt School, these post-Marxist\nthinkers and Marx himself, they were not anti-science. They believed in that\nbottom, bottom foundation. They actually wanted\nto preserve modernity, but they wanted to get rid\nof liberalism on top of it. The postmodernist is even more radical 'cause they wanna actually\ngo down to the bottom level and overthrow it. They think science itself\nis a tool of oppression. They think it's a tool where\noppression flows through. They think that the white western world has invented these concepts, they claim that there's an objective truth and that there's reason and science. They think all of that\nis just one metanarrative and it goes a long way\nto serve the interests of the powerful. - So in the sense that,\nit's almost caricatured, but that is to the core their belief that math could be racist, for example. - Oh, yeah, absolutely.\n- Not the educational math, but literally math, the mathematics. - The notion in math that there's a right\nanswer and a wrong answer, that they believe is a metanarrative that serves white supremacy, or in the post-modernist\nmight've said it serves just the powerful or the wealthy. But so what social\njustice fundamentalism is, is you take the Marxist\nthread that has been going on in lots of countries and\nwhoever the upper and lower is, that's what they all have in common. But the upper and lower, for\nMarx was the ruling class and the oppressed class. It was economic. But you come here and the\neconomic class doesn't resonate as much here as it did maybe\nin some of those other places, but what does resonate here\nin the '60s and '70s is race and gender and these kind of\nsocial justice disagreements. And so what social\njustice fundamentalism is, is basically this tried and true framework of this Marxist framework\nwith a new skin on it, which is American social justice. And then made even more radical with the infusion of post-modernism, where not just is liberalism bad, but actually the sign that like you said, math can be racist. So it's this philosophical Frankenstein, this stitched together of these and so again, it's called,\nthey wear the same uniform as the liberal social justice. They say social justice, right? Racial equality, but it has nothing to do\nwith liberal social justice. It is directly opposed to\nliberal social justice. - It's fascinating. The evolution of ideas, if we\nignore the harm done by it, it's fascinating how humans get together and evolve these ideas. So as you show Marxism\nis the idea that society is a zero sum. I mean, I guess the zero sum\nis really important thing here. Zero sum struggle between the ruling class and the working class\nwith power being exerted through politics and economics. Then you add critical theory\nMarxism 2.0 on top of that, and you add to politics and economics, you add culture and institutions. And then on top of that,\nfor post-modernism, you add science, you add morality, basically anything else you can think of. - To stitch together Frankenstein. And if you notice, which\nis not necessarily bad, but in this case, I think\nit's actually violating the Marxist tradition\nby being anti-science. And it's violating the post-modernism because what post-modernists were, they were radical skeptics. They were radical skeptics, not\njust of the way things were, but of their own beliefs. And social justice fundamentalism is not at all self-critical. It says that we have the answers, which is the opposite\nof what post-modernists would ever say, no, you just\nhave another meta-narrative. And it's also violating, of course, the tradition of liberal social\njustice in a million ways 'cause it's anti-liberal. And so this Frankenstein comes together. Meanwhile, liberal social justice doesn't have a Frankenstein. It's very clear. It's a crisp ideology that says we're trying to\nget to a more perfect union. They're trying to keep the promises made in the Constitution. And that's what it's trying to do. And so it's much simpler in a lot of ways. - So you write that my big problem with social justice fundamentalism isn't the ideology itself. It's what scholars and\nactivists started to do sometimes around 2013 when\nthey began to wield a cudgel that's not supposed to have\nany place in the country like the US. So it's the actions, not the ideas. - Well, it's clear, I\ndon't like the ideology. I think it's a low-rung ideology. I think it's morally inconsistent\nbased on it's flip-flops on its morals depending on the group. I think it's echo chambery. I think it's full of inaccuracies and can't stand up to debate. So I think it's a low, but there's a ton of low-rung\nideologies I don't like. I don't like a lot of religious doctrines. I don't like a lot of\npolitical doctrines, right? The US is a place inherently\nthat is a mishmash of a ton of ideologies. And I'm not gonna like two\nthirds of them at any given time. So my problem, the reason\nI'm writing about this is not 'cause I'm like, by the way, this ideology is not something I like. That's not interesting. The reason that it must be\nwritten about right now, this particular ideology, is\nbecause it's not playing nicely with others. If you wanna be a hardcore,\nevangelical Christian in the US says live and let live. Not only are you allowed to have an echo chamber of some kind, it's actively protected here. Live and let live. They can do what they want. You do what you want. Now, if the evangelical\nChristian started saying, by the way, anyone who says anything that conflicts with\nevangelical Christianity is going to be severely socially punished. And they have the cultural power to do so, which they don't in this case. They might like to, but\nthey don't have the power. I'll be able to get\nanyone fired who they want and they're able to actually\nchange the curriculum in all of these schools in\nclass to suddenly not conflict with no more evolution in the textbooks because they don't want it. Now I would write a book about why, about evangelical Christianity, because that's what every liberal, regardless of what you think of the actual horizontal beliefs, doesn't matter what they believe when they start violating\nlive and let live and shutting down other\nsegments of society. It's not the best analogy, but an echo chamber is\nlike a benign tumor. And what you have to\nwatch out for is a tumor that starts to metastasize, starts to forcefully spread and\ndamage the tissue around it. And that's what this particular\nideology has been doing. - Do you worry about it\nas an existential threat to liberalism in the West,\nin the United States? Is it a problem or is\nit the biggest problem that's threatening all\nof human civilization? - I would not say it's\nthe biggest problem. It might be, if it turns out in 50 years, someone says actually it\nwas, I wouldn't be shocked. But I also, I wouldn't bet on that 'cause there's a lot of problems. - I'm a little sorry to interrupt. It is popular to say that thing though. And it's less popular to\nsay the same thing about AI or nuclear weapons, which\nworries me that I'm more worried about nuclear weapons even\nstill than I am about wokeism. - I've had probably 1,000\narguments about this. That's one nice thing\nabout spending six years procrastinating on getting\na book done is you end up battle testing your ideas a million times. So I've heard this one a lot, right? Which is there's three groups\nof former Obama voters. One is super woke now. Another one is super anti-woke now. And the third is what you just said, which is sure, wokeness\nis over the top, right? You're not woke, but I think that the anti-woke people\nare totally lost their mind. And it's just not that big a deal, right? Now here's why I disagree with that. Because it's not wokeness itself. It's that a radical political movement of which there will always\nbe a lot in the country has managed to do something\nthat a radical movement is not supposed to be\nable to do in the US, which is they've managed to hijack institutions\nall across the country and hijack medical\njournals and universities and the ACLU, all the\nactivist organizations and nonprofits and NGOs.\n- And certain tech companies. - Yeah, and many tech companies. So it's not that I think\nthis thing is so bad. It's a little like we said with Trump. The reason Trump scares me\nis not 'cause Trump's so bad. It's that because it shows that it reveals that we were vulnerable\nto a demagogue candidate. And what wokeness reveals to\nme is that we are currently, and until something changes, we'll continue to be vulnerable to a bully movement and a\nforcefully expansionist movement that wants to actually\ndestroy the workings, their liberal gears and tear them apart. And so here's the way I\nview a liberal democracy is, it is a bunch of these institutions that were trial and error\ncrafted over hundreds of years. And they all rely on trust, public trust. And there's certain\nkind of feeling of unity that actually is critical to a liberal democracy's functioning. And what I see this thing is,\nis there's a parasite on that, that whose goal is, and I'm\nnot saying each, by the way, each individual in this is I\ndon't think they're bad people. I think that it's the ideology\nitself has the property of its goal is to tear apart\nthe pretty delicate workings of the liberal democracy and shred the critical lines of trust. And so you talk about AI and you talk about all\nthese other big problems, nuclear, right? The reason I like writing\nabout that stuff a lot more than I like writing about politics, this wasn't a fun topic for me, is because I realized\nthat, all of those things, if they're gonna have a good\nfuture with those things and they're actually threats, like I said, we need to have our wits about us and we need the liberal\ngears and levers working, we need the liberal machine working. And so if something's\nthreatening to undermine that, it affects everything else. - We need to have our\nscientific mind about us, about these foundational ideas. But I guess my sense of hope comes from observing the immune\nsystem respond to wokeism. There seems to be a\npro-liberalism immune system. And not only that, so\nthere's intellectuals, there's people that are\nwilling to do the fight. You talk about courage, being courageous. And there is a hunger for that, such that those ideas can\nbecome viral and they take over. So I just don't see a mechanism by which wokeism accelerates\nexponentially and takes over, like it's expand. It feels like as it expands,\nthe immune system responds. The immune system of liberalism,\nof basically a country, at least in the United States, that's still ultimately at the\ncore of the individual values the freedom of speech,\njust freedoms in general, the freedom of an individual. But that's the battle, which is stronger. - So to me it is like a\nvirus in an immune system. And I totally agree, I see\nthe same story happening. And I'm sitting here rooting\nfor the immune system. - Are you still worried? - Well, here's the thing. So a liberal democracy is\nalways gonna be vulnerable to a movement like this, right? And there will be more. Because it's not a\ntotalitarian dictatorship. Because if you can\nsocially pressure people to not say what they're thinking, you can suddenly start\nto just take over, right? You can break the liberalism of the liberal democracy quite easily and suddenly a lot of\nthings are illiberal. On the other hand, the same vulnerability, the same system that's vulnerable to that, also is hard to truly conquer. Because now the Maoists,\nright, similar kind of vibe. They were saying that science is evil and that the intellectuals are, it's all this big conspiracy. But they could murder you. And they had the hard\ncudgel in their hand, right? And the hard cudgel is scary. And you can conquer a\ncountry with the hard cudgel. But you can't use that in the US. So what they have is a soft cudgel, which can have the same effect initially. You can scare people into shutting up. You can't maybe imprison\nthem and murder them. But if you can socially ostracize\nthem and get them fired, that basically is gonna\nhave the same effect. So the soft cudgel can have\nthe same effect for a while, but the thing is, it's a\nlittle bit of a house of cards because it relies on fear. And as soon as that fear goes away, the whole thing falls apart, right? The soft cudgel requires people to be so scared of getting\ncanceled or getting whatever. And as soon as some people\nstart, Toby Lutka of Shopify, I always think about he just said, you know what, I'm not\nscared of this soft cudgel, and spoke up and said, we're\nnot political at this company and we're not a family, we're a team and we're gonna do this. And, you know what, they're thriving. - He will be on this podcast, he seems like a fascinating human. - [Tim] He's amazing. - He spoke up, he's saying we're not- - He's one of the smartest\nand kindest dudes, but also, he has courage\nat a time when it's hard. But here's the thing is\nthat it's different than that you need so much less courage against a soft cudgel than you'd do. The Iranians, throwing\ntheir hijabs into the fire. Those people's courage just blows away any courage we have here,\n'cause they might get executed. That's the thing, is that you can actually\nhave courage right now. - [Operator] I'm not sure I understand. - Sorry. (Lex giggles) - Don't worry about it. - Oh, man, the irony of that. And you talk about, so\ntwo things to fight this, there's two things, awareness and courage. What's the awareness piece? - (sighs) The awareness piece, first just know understanding the stakes, getting your heads out of\nthe sand and being like, technology's blowing up exponentially. Our society's trust is devolving, we're kind of falling apart\nin some important ways. We're losing our grip on some\nstability at the worst time. That's the first point,\njust the big picture. And then also awareness of,\nI think this vertical axis, or whatever your version of it is, this concept of how do I\nreally form my beliefs? Where do they actually come from? Are they someone else's beliefs? Am I following a checklist? How about my values? I used to identify with the\nblue party or the red party, but now they've changed and\nI suddenly am okay with that. Is that because my values changed with it or am I actually anchored to the party, not to any principle? Asking yourself these questions. Looking for where do I feel disgusted by fellow human beings? Maybe I'm being a crazy tribal\nperson without realizing it. How about the people around me? Am I being bullied by some echo chamber without realizing it? Am I the bully somewhere? So that's the first, I think\njust to do a self audit. And I think that just\nsome awareness like that and just self audit about\nthese things can go a long way. But if you keep it to\nyourself, it's almost useless, awareness without\ncourage does very little. So courage is when you take that awareness and you actually export\nit out into the world and it starts affecting other people. And so courage can happen\non multiple levels. It can happen by first of all, just stop saying stuff you don't believe. If you're being pressured\nby a ideology or a movement to say stuff that you don't\nactually believe, just stop, just stay in your ground\nand don't say anything. That's courage, that's one first step. Start speaking out in small groups, start actually speaking\nyour mind, see what happens. The sky doesn't usually fall. Actually, people usually\nrespect you for it, not every group, but you'd be surprised. And then eventually, maybe start speaking out in bigger groups, start going public, go public with it, and you don't need everyone doing this. Some people will lose their jobs for it. I'm not talking to those people. Most people won't lose their jobs, but they have the same fear\nas if they would, right? And it's like, what, are\nyou gonna get criticized or are you gonna get a bunch of angry Twitter people\nwill criticize you? Yeah, it's not pleasant, but actually that's a little\nbit like our primitive minds fear that really, back\nwhen it was programmed, that kind of ostracism or criticism will leave you out of the\ntribe and you'll die today. It's a delusional fear. It's not actually that scary. And the people who have realized that can exercise incredible\nleadership right now. - So you have a really\ninteresting description of self-censorship also, as you've been talking\nabout, who's King Mustache? And this gap, I think, I\nhope you write even more, even more than you've written\nin the book about these ideas, 'cause it's so strong. This censorship gaps that are created between the dormant thought pile and the kind of thing\nunder the speech curve. - Yeah. So first of all, I think it's a useful tool, is this thing called a thought pile, on any given issue, you\nhave a horizontal spectrum. And just say I could take\nyour brain out of your head and I put it on the thought\npile right where you happen to believe about that issue. Now, I did that for\neveryone in the community or in a society, and you're gonna end up\nwith a big mushy pile that I think will often\njust form a bell curve. If it's really politicized,\nit might form like a camel with two humps, 'cause\nit's concentrated here, but for a typical issue,\nit'll just form a fear of AI, you're gonna have a bell curve, right? Things like this. That's the thought pile. Now, the second thing is a line that I call the speech curve, which is what people are saying. So the speech curve is high when not just a lot of\npeople are saying it, but it's being said from\nthe biggest platforms, being said in the New York Times and it's being said by the president on the State of the Union, those things are the\ntop of the speech curve. And then when the speech across lower, it means it's being said either\nwhispered in small groups or it's just not very many\npeople are talking about it. When a free speech democracy\nis healthy on a certain topic, you've got the speech curve sitting right on top of the thought pile. They mirror each other which\nis naturally what would happen. More people think something is\ngonna be said more often than from higher platforms. What censorship does, and that censorship can\nbe from the government, so I use the tale of King Mustache. And King Mustache, he's\na little tiny tyrant, and he's very sensitive, and people are making fun of his mustache, and they're saying he's not a good king, and he does not like that. So what does he do? He enacts a policy, and he says, anyone who has heard criticizing me or my mustache or my rule\nwill be put to death. And immediately at the town, because his father was a very liberal, there was always free\nspeech in his kingdom. But now King Mustache has taken over, and he's saying this is a new rules now. And so a few people\nyell out, and they say, that's not how we do things here. And that moment is what\nI call a moment of truth. Did the king's guards\nstand with the principles of the kingdom and say,\nyeah, King Mustache, that's not what we do, in which case he would kind of have to, he's nothing he can do. Or are they going to execute? So in this case, it's as if\nhe laid down an electric fence over a part of the stockpile and said, no one's allowed\nto speak over here. The speech curve, maybe people\nwill think these things, but the speech curve cannot go over here. But the electric fence\nwasn't actually electrified until the king's guards,\nin a moment of truth, get scared and say, okay, and they hang the five\npeople who spoke out. So in that moment, that\nfence just became electric. And now no one criticizes\nKing Mustache anymore. So I use this as an allegory. Now, of course he has a hard cudgel, 'cause he can execute people. But now when we look at the US, what you're seeing right\nnow is a lot of pressure, which is very similar. An electric fence is being laid down, saying no one can criticize these ideas. And if you do, you won't be\nexecuted, you'll be canceled. You'll be fired. Now, is that fence electrified from there? No, they can't actually,\nthey're not working the company, they can't fire you. But they can start a Twitter mob when someone violates that speech curve, when someone violates that speech rule. And then the leadership at the company has the moment of truth. And what the leaders should do is stand up for their company's values, which is almost always\nin favor of the employee and say, look, even if\nthey make a mistake, people make mistakes,\nwe're not gonna fire them. Or maybe that person\nactually said something that's reasonable, and\nwe should discuss it. But either way, we're not gonna fire them. And if they said no, what happens is the Twitter\nmob actually doesn't have, they can't execute you, they go away, and the fence is proving\nto have no electricity. What's been the problem\nwith the past few years is what's happened again and again, is the leader gets scared, and they get scared of the\nTwitter mob when they fire them. Boom, that fence has electricity. And now, actually, if you cross that, it's not just a threat. You will be out of a job. It's really bad. You'll have a huge penalty. You might not be able to feed your kids. So that's an electric fence that goes up. Now, what happens when\nan electric fence goes up and it's proven to\nactually be electrified? The speech curve morphs into\na totally different position. And now these new people say, instead of having the marketplace of ideas that turns into a natural bell\ncurve, they say, no, no, no. These ideas are okay to\nsay, and not just okay. You'll be socially rewarded. And these ones don't. That's the rules of their own echo chamber that they're now applying to\neveryone, and it's working. And so, the speech curve distorts. And so you end up with,\nnow, instead of one region, which is a region of\nactive communal thinking, what people are thinking and saying, you now have three regions. You have a little active\ncommunal thinking, but mostly, you now have\nthis dormant thought pile, which is all these\nopinions that, suddenly, everyone's scared to say out loud. - [Lex] Everyone's thinking but they're scared to say it loud. - Everyone's thinking,\nbut no one's saying. And then you have this other region, which is the approved ideas\nof this now cultural dictator and those are being spoken\nfrom the largest platforms, and they're being\nrepeated by the president, and they're being repeated\nall over the place, even though people don't believe it. And that's this distortion and what happens is the\nsociety becomes really stupid because active communal\nthinking is the region where we can actually think together. And now no one can think together and it gets siloed into\nsmall private conversations. - It's really powerful what you said about institutions and so on. It's not trivial from a\nleadership position to be like, no, we defend the employee or\ndefend the, yeah, employee, the person with us on our, 'cause there's no actual\nground to any kind of violation we're hearing about. So the mob, they resist the mob. It's ultimately to the leader, I guess, of a particular institution\nor a particular company. And it's difficult. - Oh, yeah, no, no, it's not. If it were easy, there wouldn't be all of these failings. And by the way this is\nthe immune system failing. That's the liberal immune\nsystem of that company failing, but also then it's an example, which means that a lot of other, it's failing to the\ncountry, it's not easy. Of course it's not because\nwe have primitive minds that are wired to care so much about what people think of us. First of all, we're scared\nthat it's gonna start, 'cause you know what, what are mobs do? They don't just say,\nI'm gonna criticize you. I'm gonna criticize anyone\nwho still buys your product. I'm gonna criticize anyone\nwho goes on your podcast. So, it's not just you. It's now suddenly if Lex\nbecomes tarnished enough. Now, I go on the podcast\nand people are saying, oh, I'm not buying his book. And he went on Lex Friedman? No, thanks, right? And now I get, I call it a smear web, like you've been smeared and we're in such a bad time\nthat it smear travels to me. And now, meanwhile, someone buys my book and tries to share it, someone said, you're buying that guy's book? He goes on Lex Friedman. You see how this happens, right? So, that hasn't happened in this case. We are so wired not, that\nis kind of bad, right? That is actually bad for you, but we're wired to care about it so much because it meant life or\ndeath back in the day. - Yeah, yeah. And luckily in this case, we're both probably can smear each other in this conversation.\n- Yes. - This is wonderful.\n- I smear you all in the- - Given the nature of your book. What do you think about\nfreedom of speech as a term and as an idea, as a way\nto resist the mechanism, this mechanism of a dormant thought pile and artificially generated speech, this ideal of the freedom of speech and protecting speech\nand celebrating speech. - Yeah. Well, so this is the point\nI was talking about earlier about King Mustache made a rule against, he's created official- - One of the amazing\nthings about your book, as you get later and later in the book, you cover more and more difficult issues as a way to illustrate the importance of the vertical perspective. But there's something about using hilarious drawings throughout that make it much more fun and it takes you away\nfrom the personal somehow and you start thinking\nin the space of ideas versus like outside of the\ntribal type of thinking. So it's a really brilliant, I mean, I would advise for anybody to do, when they write controversial books to have hilarious drawings. - It's true. Put the silly stick figure in\nyour thing and it lightens, it does, it lightens the mood. It gets people's guard down a little bit. - [Lex] Yeah, and it works. - It reminds people that\nwe're all friends here, right? Let's laugh at ourselves,\nlaugh at the fact that we're like in a\nculture war a little bit and now we can talk about it, right? As opposed to like getting\nreligious about it. But basically like King\nMustache had no First Amendment. He said, the government\nis censoring, right? Which is very common\naround the world, right? Government censor all them. The US, again, you can argue there's some\ncontroversial things recently, but basically the US, the First Amendment\nisn't the problem, right? No one is being arrested\nfor saying the wrong thing, but this graph is still happening. And so freedom of speech,\nwhat people like to say is, if someone's complaining about\na cancel culture and saying, this is an anti-free speech,\npeople like to point out, no, it's not. The government's not\narresting you for anything. This is called the free market, buddy. You're putting your ideas out\nand you're getting criticized and your precious marketplace of ideas. There it is, right? I've gotten this a lot. And this is not making\na critical distinction between cancel culture\nand criticism culture. Criticism culture is a little bit of this high-rung idea\nlab stuff we talked about. Criticism culture attacks the idea and encourages further discussion, right? It enlivens discussion. It makes everyone smarter. Cancel culture attacks the\nperson, very different. Criticism culture says, here's\nwhy this idea is so bad, let me tell you. Cancel culture says, here's\nwhy this person is bad and no one should talk to\nthem and they should be fired. And what does that do? It doesn't enliven the discussion. It makes everyone scared to\ntalk and it's the opposite. It shuts down discussion. So you still have your First Amendment but First Amendment plus cancel culture equals you might as well have\ngovernment censorship, right? First Amendment plus\ncriticism culture, great. Now you have this vibrant\nmarketplace of ideas. So there's a very clear difference. And so when people criticize\nthe cancel culture, and then someone says, oh,\nsee, you're so sensitive now. You're doing the cancel culture yourself. You're trying to punish\nthis person for criticism. No, no, no, no, no. Every good liberal and I\nmean that in the lower case, which is that anyone who\nbelieves in liberal democracies, regardless of what they believe, should stand up and say no\nto cancel culture and say, this is not okay, regardless\nof what the actual topic is. And that makes them a good liberal, versus if they're trying to cancel someone who's just criticizing,\nthey're doing the opposite. So it's the opposite things, but it's very easy to get confused. You can see people take advantage and sometimes they just\ndon't know it themselves. The lines here can be very confusing. The wording can be very confusing. And without that wording,\nsuddenly it looks like someone who's criticizing cancel\nculture is canceling, but they're not. - You apply this thinking to\nuniversities in particular, that there's a great, yet another great image on the trade off between knowledge and conviction. And it's what's commonly, actually can maybe explain\nto me the difference, but it's often referred to\nas the Dunning-Kruger effect, when you first learn of a thing, you have an extremely high confidence about self estimation of how\nwell you understand that thing. You actually say that\nDunning-Kruger means something else. - Everyone I post this,\neveryone's like Dunning-Kruger. And it's what everyone\nthinks Dunning-Kruger is. Dunning-Kruger is a little different. It's you have a diagonal\nline like this one, which is the place you are. I call it the humility tightrope. It's a humility sweet spot. It's exactly the right\nlevel of humility based on what you know. If you're below it, you're insecure. You actually have too much humility. You don't have amount of\nconfidence 'cause you know more than you're giving\nyourself a credit for and when you're above the line, you're in the arrogant zone, right? You need an stability. You think you know more than you do. So we all want to stay on that tightrope and Dunning-Kruger is\nbasically a straight line that's just a lower slope. So you start off, you're still getting more\nconfident as you go along, but you start off above that\nline and as you learn more, you end up below the line later. So, but anyway-\n- So this wavy thing. - [Tim] This wavy thing\nis a different phenomenon and it's just related, but- - [Lex] So this idea, so\nfor people just listening, there's a Child's Hill, pretty damn sure you know a whole lot and feeling great about it\nthat's in the beginning. And then there's an insecure\ncanyon, you crash down, acknowledging that you\ndon't know that much and then there's a growth mountain. - [Tim] Grown-Up Mountain. - Grown-Up Mountain where\nafter you feel ashamed and embarrassed about\nnot knowing that much, you begin to realize that\nknowing how little you know is the first step in becoming someone who actually knows stuff and\nthat's the Grown-Up Mountain. And you climb and climb and climb. You're saying that in universities, we're pinning people at the\ntop of the Child's Hill? - So for me, I think of myself with this\nbecause I went to college like a lot of 18 year\nolds and I was very cocky. I just thought I knew well, I know and when it came to politics,\nI was like bright blue just because I grew up\nin a bright blue suburb. I wasn't thinking that hard about it, and what I did when I went to college is met a lot of smart conservatives and a lot of smart progressives,\nbut I met a lot of people who weren't just going down a\nchecklist and they knew stuff. And suddenly I realized that\na lot of these views I have are not based on knowledge. They're based on other\npeople's conviction. Everyone else thinks that's\ntrue, so now I think it's true. Whoa, I'm actually transferring someone else's conviction to me, and who knows why they have conviction? They might have conviction 'cause they're transferring\nfrom someone else. And I'm a smart dude, I thought. Why am I giving away my own independent learning abilities here and just adopting other views? So anyway, it was this\nhumbling experience. And it wasn't just about\npolitics, by the way. It was that I had strong\nviews about a lot of stuff. And I got lucky, or not\nlucky, I sought out. The kind of people I\nsought out were the type that loved to disagree, and\nthey were, man, they knew stuff. And so you're quickly,\nagain, an ideal lab culture. It was an ideal lab. I started getting in the habit, I started loving listening to\npeople who disagreed with me 'cause it was so exhilarating\nto listen to a smart, when I thought there was no credence to this other argument, right? This side of this debate\nis obviously wrong. I wanted to see an intelligence\nsquared on that debate. I wanted to go see, I actually got into\nintelligence squared in college. I wanted to see a smart person\nwho disagrees with me talk. It became so fascinating to me. It was the most interesting thing. That was a new thing, I\ndidn't think I liked that. And so what did that do? That shoved me down, the humble\ntumble here in number three, it shoved me down where I started, and then I went the other way, where I realized that I had been, a lot of my identity had been\nbased on this faux feeling of knowledge, this idea that\nI thought I knew everything. Now that I don't have that, I\nwas like, I felt really dumb, and I felt really, almost\nembarrassed of what I knew, and so that's why I call\nthis insecure canyon. I think sometimes when you're so used to\nthinking you know everything, and then you realize you don't, and then you start to\nrealize that actually, really awesome thinkers, if\nthey don't judge me for this, they totally respect, if I say, I don't know anything about this, and say, oh, cool, you should read\nthis and this and this, they don't say it, you\ndon't know anything, they don't say that, right? By the way, this is not to say\nI'm now on Grown-Up Mountain and you should all join me. I often find myself drifting\nup with a helium balloon. I think I read about a\nnew thing and suddenly, I read three things about a\nnew AI thing and I'm like, I'll go do a talk on this. No, I won't. I'm gonna just be spouting out the opinion of the person I just read, so I have to remind myself. But it's useful. Now, the reason my problem\nwith colleges today is that, I was a graduate in 2004. This is a recent change, is that all of those speakers\nI went who disagreed with me, a lot of them were conservative, so many of those speakers\nwould not be allowed on campuses today. And so many of the discussions\nI had were in big groups or classrooms. And this was a liberal campus. So many of those disagreements,\nthey're not happening today. And I've interviewed a\nton of college students. It's chilly. People keep to themselves. So what's happening is\nnot only are people losing that push off Child's Hill, which was so valuable to me,\nso valuable to me as a thinker. It started my life as a better thinker. They're losing that, but actually what college a\nlot of the college classes and the vibe in colleges a\nlot of what is now saying that there is one right set of views, and it's this woke ideology. And it's right, and anyone\nwho disagrees with it is bad. Don't speak up, unless\nyou're gonna agree with it. It's nailing people's\nfeet to Child's Hill, it's teaching people that these are right. This user, right. You feel a complete conviction about them. - Yeah. How do we fix it? Is it part of the administration? Is it part of the culture? Is it part of like actually\ninstilling in the individual like 18-year-olds the idea\nthat this is the beautiful way to live is to embrace the disagreement and the growth from that? - It's awareness and courage. It's the same thing. Awareness is people need to\nsee what's happening here. They're not going to college\nbecoming better and tougher and more robust thinkers. They're actually going to\ncollege and becoming zealots. They're getting taught to be zealots and the website still advertises. Website is a bait and switch. - [Lex] You list all the universities. Yeah, Harvard.\n- It's a bait and switch. It's still saying, here\nyou're coming here for, and wide intellectual,\nbasically they're advertising, this is an idea lab and you get there and it's like actually\nit's an echo chamber that you're paying money for. So if people realize that, they\nstart to get mad, hopefully. And then courage, I mean,\nstarts, yes, some brave students, there's been some very brave\nstudents who have started, Big Think Clubs and stuff like that, where it's like, we're going\nto have present both sides of a debate here and that takes courage, but also courage and leadership. If you look at these colleges,\nit's specifically the leaders who show strength, who\nget the best results. Remember, the cudgel is soft. So if a leader of one\nof these places says, the college presidents who\nhave shown some strength, they actually don't get as much trouble. It's the ones who pander, in that moment of truth, they shrink away, then they get a lot more trouble. The mob smells blood. - For the listener, the\npodcast favorite, Liv Boeree, just entered, and your\nfriend just entered the room. Do you mind if she joins us? - [Lex] Please. - I think there's a\nstory she has about you. So Liv, you mentioned something that there's a funny story about, we haven't talked at all\nabout the actual process of writing the book. You guys made it better of some kind? - Yeah. (chuckles) - [Lex] Is this a true story? Is this a completely false fabric? - No, no, no, it's true. She's mean, which I did not know mean Liv. She's like a bully. She's like scary. I have that screenshot. So Liv was FaceTiming me, and she was like being intimidating. I took a screenshot and I\nmade it my phone background. So every time I opened\nit, I was like, nah. - So to give the background of this, it's because, if you hadn't noticed, Tim started writing this\nbook, how many years ago, six? - 2016, mid 2016. - Right, as sort of a response\nto like the Trump stuff. - And not even, yeah, it was just supposed to be a mini post. I was like, oh, I'm looking at\nall these future tech things and I feel this uneasiness, like, ah, we're gonna like\nmess up all these things, why? There's some cloud over our society. Let me just write a mini post. And I opened it up to WordPress to write a one day little\nessay, and things went. - [Lex] On politics. - It was gonna be on\nlike this feeling I had that our tech was just growing and growing and we were becoming less wise. What's up with that? And I just wanted to write like, just like a little thousand word essay on something I think we\nshould pay attention to, and that was the beginning\nof this six-year nightmare. - Did you anticipate also the blog post will take a long while? - And I don't remember the\nprocess fully in terms of, I remember you saying, oh,\nI'm actually writing this, it's turning into a bigger thing. And I was like, mm. Because the more we talked about, remember we were talking about, and I was like, oh, this goes deep. 'Cause I didn't really\nunderstand the full scope of the situation, no one there and you explained it and I was\nlike, okay, yeah, I see that. And then the more we dug into it, the deeper and deeper and deeper it went. No, I did not anticipate\nit would be six years. Let's put it that way. - What was your TED\ntalk on procrastination? - So that was that was March of 2016 and I started this book\nthree months later. It fell into the biggest\nprocrastination hole that I've ever fallen into. - Oh, wow.\n- The irony isn't lost on me. I like how much credit I\nhave as it for that TED talk, I am legit procrastinator. I'm not just saying it like. - Oh, it wasn't just that. Because I mean you did intend\nit to start out as a blog post but then you're like actually\nthis needs to maybe multiple, actually, let's make\nit into a full series, you know what, I'll turn it into a book. - But also what Liv witnessed a few times and my wife has witnessed 30 of these, these these 180 epiphanies where I'll have in a moment. Sometimes it's that\nthere's a really good idea, but sometimes I'm just\ndreading having to finish this the way it is. And so this epiphanies where\nit's like, you know what? I need to start over from the beginning and just make this short\nlike 20 little blog post list and then I'll do that and\nI was like, no, no, no, I have like a new epiphany I have to and it's these and yeah, it's like the crazy person a little bit. - But anyway, can I tell\nthe story of the bed? - Go for it.\n- All right, so things came to a head when we were all on vacation\non Dominican Republic, Tim and his wife, me and Igor, and we were in the ocean. And I remember you'd been\nin the ocean for an hour, just bobbing in there, becoming it and we got talking and we\nwere talking about the book and you were expressing just like this. Just the the horror of the\nsituation basically you're like, look, I just I'm so close,\nbut there's still this and then there's this. An idea popped into my head, which is the you know poker players often, we will set ourselves like negative bets. Essentially if we don't get a job done then we have to do something\nwe really don't want to do. So instead of having a carrot like a really, really big stick. So I had the idea to ask Tim. Okay, what is the worst either\norganization or individual, if you had to, that you would loathe to give a large sum of money to? And he thought about it for a little while and he gave his answer. And I was like, all right,\nwhat's your net worth? He said his net worth. All right, 10% of your\nnet worth to that thing if you don't get the draft. Because oh, sorry, but just\nbefore that I'd asked him, if you had a gun to your\nhead onto your wife's head and you had to get the booked into a state where you could like send\noff a draft to your editor, how long? He's like, oh, I guess, I could get it like 95% good in a month. I was like, okay great. In one month's time if you do\nnot have that edit handed in- - You see scary. (all chattering) Really scary. - 10% of your net worth\nis going to this thing that you really, really think is terrible. - But you're forgetting the kicker. - Go on. - The kicker was that 'cause procrastinator is they self-defeat, that's what they do. And then Liv says I'm\ngonna sweeten the deal. And I am going to basically match you and I'm gonna send a huge\namount of my own money there, if you don't do it. That would be really bad for me. - So not only are you screwing yourself, your screwing a friend. And she was like, as your\nfriend, because I'm your friend, I will send it, I will send the money. I mean, like tyranny. and I got the drafting. - Yeah.\n- I got the drafting. - Just, just.\n- I know. Actually it was it was funny 'cause it was supposed to\nbe by the summer solstice or whatever it was. It was like a certain date. And I got it in at 4 AM, the next morning, and they were both like,\nthat doesn't count. I'm like it does. It's still for me it's the same day still. - Do you imagine how fucked\nin the head you have to be, to literally technically passed\nthe deadline by four hours for an obscene amount of\nmoney to a thing you loathe, that's how bad his sickness. - Because I knew the hard deadline, I knew that there was no way she was gonna actually send\nthat money because it was 4 AM, so I knew I actually had\nthe whole night, so, yeah. - Yeah, I should actually punish you and I should send like a\nnominal amount to that thing. - No, thanks. No. - Is there some micro lessons from that from how to avoid\nprocrastination writing a book that you've learned? - Yes, well, I've learned a lot of things. I mean, first, don't\nwrite like a dissertation about proving some grand theory of society 'cause that's really procrastinating. I would have been an awful PhD\nstudent for that reason some and so I'm gonna do another book and it's gonna be like a\nbunch of short chapters that are one-offs 'cause\nit just doesn't feed- - Your book is like a giant framework. There is grand theory\nall through your book. - I know and I learn not to do that again. I did it once. I don't wanna do it again. - Oh, with the book, with a mistake. So the book is a giant mistake. - Yes, don't do another one of these. Look, some people should\nit's just not for me. - You just did it.\n- I know, and it almost killed me. Okay, so that's the first one. But secondly, yeah,\nbasically there's two ways to fix procrastination. One, picture you have\na boat that's leaking and it's not working very well. You can fix it in two ways. You can get your hammer and nails out and your boards and actually fix the boat. Or you can duct tape it for now to get yourself across the river, but it's not actually fixed. So ideally, down the road, I have repaired whatever kind\nof bizarre mental illness that I have that makes me procrastinate, I just don't self-defeat\nin this way anymore. But in the meantime, I\ncan duct tape the boat by bringing what I call the panic monster into the situation via things like this and this scary person and\nhaving external pressure, to have external pressure of\nsome kind is critical for me. Yes, I don't have the muscle\nto do the work I need to do without external pressure. - By the way, Liv, is\nthere a possible future where you write a book? - [Liv] Oh. (both giggles) - And meanwhile, by the\nway, huge procrastinator. That's the funny thing about this. - Yeah, I mean, I'm- - How long did your last video take you? - Oh, my God. - Is there advice that you give to Liv, how to get the videos done faster? - Well, it would be the same exact thing. I mean, actually, I can give\ngood procrastination advice. - [Lex] Panic monster,\nrate of panic monster. - Yeah, well, we should do it together. We have this date. - We should actually just do another bet. I have to have my script\ndone by this time. - Yes.\n- Yeah, so I gotta get the third part out. - Because then you'll actually do it. And it's not, the thing is, the time in, if you could take three weeks on a video and instead you take 10 weeks, it's not like, oh, well, I'm having more fun in those 10 weeks. The whole 10 weeks are bad. - Yeah, I told you.\n- Bad, so you're just having a bad time and you're getting less\nwork done and less work out. And it's not like you're\nenjoying your personal life. It's bad for your relationships. It's bad for your own. - [Lex] You keep doing it anyway. - Yeah, why do people have\ntroubles keeping a diet, right? Primitive mind. - Why'd you point at\nme when you said that? That was offensive. - What's your procrastination\nweakness, do you have one? - Everything, everything, everything. Everything, preparing for a conversation. I had your book, amazing book. I really enjoyed it. I started reading it. I was like, this is awesome. It's so awesome that I'm going to save it when I'm behind the\ncomputer and can take notes, like good notes. Of course, that resulted\nin like last minute, everything, everything,\neverything I'm doing in my life. - Not everyone's like that. People self-defeating different ways. Some people don't have\nthis particular problem. Adam Grant, he calls\nhimself a pre-crastinator where he gets an assignment. He will go home and do it\nuntil it's done and handed it, which is also not necessarily good. You're rushing it either\nway, but it's better. But some people have the\nopposite thing where they will, the looming deadline makes them so anxious that they go and fix it. The procrastinator, I think,\nhas a similar anxiety, but they solve it in a\ntotally different way. - [Lex] Or they don't solve it. They just live with the anxiety. - Right.\n- Right, right. Now, I think there's an\neven bigger group of people. There's these people, the Adam Grant's, there's people like me. And then there's people who\nhave a healthy relationship with deadlines, but they're\nstill part of a bigger group of people that actually, they need a deadline\nthere to do something. So they still are motivated by a deadline. And as soon as you have\nall the things in life that don't have a\ndeadline, like working out and working on that album\nyou wanted to write, they don't do anything, either. So that's why procrastination\nis a much bigger problem than people realize, because it's not just the\nfunny last second people. It's anyone who actually\ncan't get things done that don't have a deadline. - You dedicate your book, \"to Tannis, who never planned on\nbeing married to someone who would spend six years\ntalking about his book on politics, but here we are.\" What's the secret to a\nsuccessful relationship with a procrastinator? That's maybe for both of you. - Well, I think the first\nand most important thing. - You already started with a\npolitical answer, I can tell, okay, go ahead. - No, the first and\nmost important thing is, 'cause people who don't procrastinate, people in their instinct is to judge it, they think they're just\nbeing like a loser, or they'll take it personally, and instead to see this as like, this is some form of addiction\nor some form of ailment. They're not just being a dick, right? They have a problem and some compassion, but then also maybe finding that line where you can maybe apply some tough love, some middle ground. On the other hand, you might say that you don't want the\nsignificant other relationship where it's like they're\nin the one nagging you. You don't want them\neven being part of that, and I think that maybe it's better to have a Liv do it instead. - Right, having someone who\ncan create the infrastructure where they aren't the direct stick. You need a bit of carrot and stick, right? Maybe they can be the person who keeps reminding them of the carrot, and then they set up a\nfriend group to be the stick, and then that keeps your\nrelationship in a good place. - Like looming in the background,\nthat's your friend group. Okay. At the beginning of the conversation, we talked about how all of\nhuman history can be presented as a thousand page book. What are you excited\nabout for the 1,000th, what do you say, that first page? So the next 250 years. What are you most excited about? - I'm most excited about, have you read \"The Fable of the Dragon?\" Okay, well, it's an allegory for death and it's Nick Bostrom. He compares death to a dragon\nthat eats 60 million people or whatever the number is every year. And every year we shepherd those people up and they feed them to the dragon and that there's a Stockholm syndrome. When we say that's just a lot of man. And that's what we have to do. And anyone who says maybe we\nshould try to beat the dragon, they get called vain and narcissistic. But someone who goes, does chemo, no one calls them vain or narcissistic. They say they're good,\ngood for you, right? You're a hero, you're\nfighting the good fight. So I think there's some disconnect here. And I think that if we can get out of\nthat Stockholm syndrome and realize that death\nis just the machine, the human physical machine failing, and that there's no law of\nnature that says you can't, with enough technology, repair the machine and\nkeep it going until, I don't think anyone\nwants to live forever. People think they do, no one does. But until people are ready. And I think when we hit a world where we have enough\ntech that we can continue to keep the human machine\nalive until the person says, I'm done, I'm ready. I think we will look\nback and we will think that anything before that time,\nthat'll be the real AD, BC. We'll look back at BC\nbefore the big advancement and it'll seem so sad and\nso heartbreaking, barbaric. And people will say, I can't\nbelieve that humans like us had to live with that\nwhen they lost loved ones and they died before they were ready. I think that's the ultimate achievement, but we need to stop\ncriticizing and smearing people who you talk about it. - So you think that's actually\ndoable in the next 250 years? - A lot happens in 250 years, especially when technology is\nreally exponentially, yeah. - And you think humans will be around versus AI complete takes over. Where fatality means something complete- - Look, the optimist in me and maybe the stupid kind\nof 2023 person in me says, yeah, of course, we'll make it. We'll figure it out. But you know, I mean, we\nare going into a crate. I have a friend who knows\nas much about the future as anyone I know. I mean, he's a big investor\nand stuff, future tech. And he's really on the pulse of things. And he just says the\nfuture's gonna be weird. That's what he says, the\nfuture's gonna be weird. It's gonna be weird. Don't look at the last\nfew decades of your life and apply that forward and say, that's just what life is like. No, no, no, it's gonna\nbe weird and different. - Well, some of my favorite\nthings in this world are weird and speaking of which, it's\ngood to have this conversation. It's good to have you as friends. This was an incredible one\nand thanks for coming back and thanks for talking\nwith me a bunch more times. This was awesome. - Thank you Lex.\n- Thank you. - Thanks for listening to this\nconversation with Tim Urban. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Winston Churchill. When there's no enemy within, the enemies outside cannot hurt you. Thank you for listening, and\nhope to see you next time.",
