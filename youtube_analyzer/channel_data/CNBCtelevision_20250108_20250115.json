        ">> I'M CONFIDENT. >> WHO DESERVES CREDIT FOR THIS, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU OR TRUMP? >> IS HAT A JOKE? OH. THANK YOU. >> THAT WAS PRESIDENT BIDEN  SPEAKING ON THE ISRAEL/HAMAS  CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT JUST NOW,  UPDATING THE NATION. ALTHOUGH LEAVING SOME QUESTIONS  OUT THERE. EAMON JAVERS HERE TO WRAP THE  KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR US. EAMON? >> THE PRESIDENT OUTLINED A  THREE-STAGE PROCESS THAT'S NOW  BEEN AGREED TO BY ISRAEL AND  HAMAS, AND PART ONE OF THAT  PROCESS IS A SIX-WEEK PERIOD OF  TIME IN WHICH THEY'RE GOING TO  WORK OUT THE RELEASE OF SOME OF  THE EARLY STAGES OF HOSTAGES,  INCLUDING, HE SAID, THE ELDERLY, WOMEN, ANYBODY WHO'S WOUNDED. AND ALSO ANY AMERICAN HOSTAGES  WILL BE RELEASED IN THAT FIRST  PHASE. PHASE II IS GOING TO BE THE  RELEASE OF REMAINING LIVING  HOSTAGES, INCLUDING MALE  SOLDIERS. AND THEN IN FAZE III, THE  PRESIDENT REFERRED TO A MAJOR  RECONSTRUCTION OF GAZA, WHICH  HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED  IN THE WAKE OF ISRAEL'S INVASION THERE, IN RESPONSE TO THE  OCTOBER 7th TERRORIST ATTACK. SO ALL OF THAT TAKEN INTO PLACE, THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTED, SETS A  ROAD MAP NOW FOR PEACE AND  DEVELOPMENT IN THE REGION, EVEN  THOUGH THIS IS JUST A CEASE-FIRE DEAL. THIS IS PRESIDENT BIDEN, WHO'S  CLEARLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE  FUTURE IN THE REGION, IN THE  WAKE OF THIS NEARLY YEAR-LONG  NEGOTIATION. THE PRESIDENT SAYING THAT THIS  IS AN AGREEMENT THAT HE PUT  FORWARD LAST YEAR. AND HE SAYS THAT HE PREPARES TO  LEAVE OFFICE, AMERICA FREENSDS  ARE STRONG, AND ITS ENEMIES ARE  WEAK. THE PRESIDENT ALSO REFERRING  VAGUELY TO THE INCOMING TRUMP  TEAM, SUGGESTING THAT HE WORKED  CLOSELY WITH THE TRUMP TEAM ON  NEGOTIATING THE FINAL DETAILS  HERE, GUYS. WE'LL WAIT AND SEE THE FINAL  DETAILS IN TERMS OF WHO'S  RELEASED, HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE  STILL LIVE TO BE RELEASED, AND  WHEN ALL OF THAT WILL HAPPEN. >> AND FIRST, THE NEWS OF THE  CEASE-FIRE IS THE NEWS. THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS. THAT IS THE PEACE, THAT IS WHAT  WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR AND THAT  SHOULD BE THE KEY TAKEAWAY, AND  HOPEFULLY IT IS. BUT THIS ALSO BEING THE UNITED  STATES, EAMON, AT A TIME OF  TRANSITION, YOU KNOW WHERE I'M  GOING WITH THIS. KELLY AND I WERE KIND OF LOOKING AT EACH OTHER. IT APPEARS, AT LEAST ON THIS  SIDE OF THE CAMERA, THAT BOTH  ADMINISTRATIONS ARE TRYING TO  TAKE PART OR SOME OR ALL CREDIT  FOR WHAT HAPPENED. YOU HEARD THE FINAL QUESTION  THERE YELLED BY REPORTERS,  SOMETHING, I THINK IT WAS KELLY, WHO DO WE TAKE MORE OF THIS TO,  YOU OR TRUMP. >> HE SAID, TRUMP'S TEAM IS  TAKING CREDIT FOR THAT, DO THEY  DESERVE AND HE JUST SAID, IS  THIS A JOKE? >> AND BIDEN DID SAY THEY WERE  WORKING AS ONE WITH THE TRUMP  TEAM. IS THERE ANY WAY TO GALVANIZE -- TELL ME IF IT'S CORRECT THAT  BOTH PARTIES, BOTH  ADMINISTRATIONS DO APPEAR TO BE  TAKING CREDIT FOR THIS. >> ABSOLUTELY. BRIAN, YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING,  VICTORY HAS A THOUSAND FATHERS  AND DEFEAT IS AN ORPHAN. I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S PLAYING  OUT HERE. THIS IS A VERY GOOD THING FOR  THE UNITED STATES, VERY GOOD  THING FOR ISRAEL. THIS IS A CEASE-FIRE THAT'S  LARGELY ON ISRAEL'S TERMS,  BECAUSE OF THE DECIMATION OF  HAMAS THAT HAPPENED IN ISRAEL'S  MILITARY RESPONSE, WHICH HAS AN  YOU HEARD PRESIDENT BIDEN SAY  WAS BACKED BY AMERICAN MILITARY  POWER AND AID, BUT CLEARLY, BOTH THE OUTGOING AND THE INCOMING  ADMINISTRATION ARE TRYING TO  TAKE CREDIT FOR THIS, FORMER AND FUTURE PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT OUT A STATEMENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA A  SHORT TIME AGO, SAYING THIS  WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED IF I  WASN'T ELECTED. YOU JUST HEARD PRESIDENT BIDEN  SAYING, THIS IS THE EXACT DEAL  THAT I PUT ON THE TABLE MONTHS  AND MONT",

        ">>> welcome back to \"the  exchange\".   about 100 million americans  shopped on a social media app  last year, with sales surging  26% year on year.  the firm saying the launch of  tiktok shop at the end of 2023  was single-handedly responsible  for that spike.  our next guest has worked  closely with tiktok before the  launch of shop and was one of  its earliest adopters, and her  business, beachwaver,  raked in  nearly 1.5 million orders in  less than two years.  joining me to discuss how she  will pivot if tiktok goes dark  on sunday, is sarah, the ceo  and founder of beachwaver.   sarah, to repeat, i never  thought we would get this far  too basically almost going  dark, and maybe we won't, but i  can't imagine if my literal  livelihood was at stake.  how are you feeling right now?  >> it feels like the end of an  era.  we started in 2019 making some  viral videos, a smr, just  trying to showcase new product  development and for us, we have  built a phenomenal community.  we have live streamed over 1000  hours on the platform.  we have one .3 million  followers.  and it has really felt like we  have built this community that  really supports us as an  independent, women-owned  company.  and for us, it has been so much  fun, right?  we have been able to bring in a  lot of creativity to our brand,  we have been able to launch a  lot of roducts, like you said,  over 1.3 million orders on the  app is crazy.  and we have been able to  support our company, based here  in illinois.  we have a phenomenal  distribution center where we do  send all of those orders out  directly, through tiktok,  through us.  and we also have affiliates, we  have over 1000 affiliates that  are creating content, that are  selling --  >> holy cow!  so, sarah, not to embarrass you  here, but according to market  pulse, your sales per month are  almost $3 million on this.  is that in the range?  you don't have to tell me, but,  so, what are you going to do?  >> yeah, so, we have been  around for 15 years, we are  women-owned, i started with my  two sisters and for us, we have  always had an established  company.  prior to that, we were on qvc,  and retailers like target and  alltel.  so for us, we really have been  shifting back to that strategy  of in person experiences.  we also have a lot of other  social media platforms that we  have been very established on,  including instagram.  so, for us, we love this  community, we really have been  able to develop it, but we are  looking forward to giving a lot  of energy to some of the other  platforms that are available.  >> yeah, you don't seem that  concerned, so i give you  credit.  you morph and you morphed  again, and what does that look  like?  instagram reels?  youtube?  snap?  what is it?  >> yeah, instagram reels right  off the bat.  youtube, youtube shorts is very  similar to a tiktok strategy,  so i am obviously very  concerned because of the  community, but we have such a  strong community that we have  done some things like adding a  link and url on tiktok, we have  been going live almost daily  just to let them know where the  brand will be and where they  can join us, so we have a crm  program, sms, email, really  asking our fans, our followers,  our creators to come join us on  these other platforms and if  they are an affiliate making  commission, there is a lot of  opportunities on our website,  on amazon, other places that  they continue to build their  business by selling and creating videos based on really cool  viral products like ours.  >> we were showing some of your  clips, i can't imagine what  your content budget is or how  many people must be involved.  i tried to post a little on  tiktok and it is exhausting!  you must really have a lot of  people helping out with this.  >> yes!  the cool thing about tiktok is  it doesn't take a huge budget.  we literally turn the camera on  and whatever most viral shows  up, we are incredibly proud of,  actually, it made my brother  kind of a tiktok star which is  kind of funny, it was in our  warehouse, in our distribution  center in the illinois we  started a show called \"the  packing show.\"  we would get makeup brands and  then we would launch a product,  and then we would pick one of  our favorite local charities  and this show went viral.  we did three seasons.  there is tom.  we did three seasons, where we  would actually pack their  orders live.  as you saw, we hit 45 million  likes on friday, and for that,  we have been able to donate  $100,000 to local charities.  so, that has been something our  business is very proud of.  there is a great charity called  the legacy fund which helps  american cheese farmers.  the winds are toug",

        "Nasdaq trying to break a five- day losing streak, so what is  the preview for 2025,  especially with tariffs around  the corner?  joining me to try to enter that  is calls me, let's talk energy  for a second because energy  prices have everyone's  attention today and you have  some interesting ideas about  how to invest in that space.  welcome.  >> yeah, thanks for having me,  kelly.  the good part, if you were  standing in front of me, this  is not my first rodeo.  we had a lot of similar  conversations around the idea  of tariffs, or i will call it  antidumping duties.  in 2016, when trump came to  power, it was soft with lumber  and they refer to that as the  soft with lumber dispute that  happened back then.  stockmarkets are highly elastic, and so, these movements are  being priced into securities  markets immediately.  for example, two days ago, you  could finance mega energy, or  kona up in canada that moved  off this news for the idea of  tariffs on canadian oil.  at the same time, how commodity  markets react is they just  reduce supply and it takes  time.  the problem is once you reduce  supply because of lower prices  from tariffs, it doesn't come  back immediately, so we think  this causes a big supply issue  in the long run, though.  >> i think what you are saying  is really interesting, cold, as  we are heading into this trump  2.0.  you are saying the tariffs that  we launched against canada on  lumber in 2016 made prices  higher for us and benefited  canadian producers like west  fraser.  >> correct.  >> so, where would you be  investing, now?  if you wanted to take advantage  of what might be similar  movements on a larger scale,  this time around?  >> yeah, i think the general  principle you should always  follow as an investor, is don't  look where things look the  greatest, look where things  look the worst.  so, for example, the oil  market, ending last year,  looked pretty weak to people,  people were pretty scared of it  in general, but then you walk  into this year and you slap on  the idea of tariffs on canadian  oil, pretty miserable, kelly.  for us, kelly, that is a dream.  you are getting negative  sentiment, people do want to  touch the stocks and the  reality is it is really tough  to change supply.  so, to your point on lumber,  the market swallowed with it  being over 30% tariffs, they  swallowed that.  how?  prices went higher.  if you look at 2016 to 2020,  prices were well above where  they started at during that  tariff discussion and ended up  going into the profits and free  cash flow of those canadian  producers.  we still own west fraser, it  has been a wonderful  investment.  >> so, you bought the canadian  lumber company.  are the oil companies that you  like, then, are those canadian  names?  >> correct.  our biggest is make energy, a  single asset producer in  kristina lake, they produce  what they call heavy oil or  heavy crude  which is where you  literally steam up the tar and  you get oil out of it.  so, that is a pretty common  process of there, that is the  kind of oil we are talking  about, it is not sweet crude  that we have in the permian.  the other name down there is  jeff kona, independent  producer.  the canadian producers, like  imperial, they are a little bit  less affected.  so if the spread is blown out  between wti and western canada  select oil, those refiners get  to buy the oil cheaper and if  gasoline prices don't get  tariffs, they will collect more  margins.  so, we are all under the  heading of, if you say it, it  is like christ said it, it  becomes red letter version of  king james.  the problem is, what actually  will play out might be  different.  we love how people are leading  the securities because the idea  of trump and anything he says,  it is like sugar, spice, and  everything nice.  it just sounds wonderful right  now.  the question is what will  actually happen.  security markets are moving far  quicker than commodity markets  are.  >> what you think will happen  to the u.s. Energy space?  i know you and bill -- i forget  which one he actually  mentioned, oxley was a big one.  so, what you think happens to  the u.s. Producers amid higher  tariffs on canadian oil or  elsewhere?  >> it is going to be higher  prices.  higher prices coming across the  border from canada you will  quickly recognize that america  is not producing more oil, we  are flatlining oil production.  look at the saudi's.  why are they so comfortable  allowing themselves to maintain  their supply?  because they do not believe  trump.  the -- they do not believe  \"drill, baby, drill.\"  it is the energy investors  themselves who decide to drills. If you look at energy increases  to x, you will watch a falling  stock price.  so, again, the stock market is  deciding very quickly whether  we are going to drill or not.  they are voting resoundingly  \"no.\"  a very different political  rhetoric.  >> we saw how that drill  mentality blew up during the  last shell cycle, but with oil  prices heading higher, does  that change the calculus?  does that potentially  incentivize more investors in  management teams to say, all  right, we are looking at  potentially demand growth  because of tariffs, we are  getting a higher oil price,  maybe this can be justified?  >> yes, price always regulates  price.  prices go higher, supply will  show up.  what is going on, though,  demand is continuing to grow.  we are not dealing with  declining demand in oil  products, for example.  the question is, as we go from  today to 10 years from now,  there will be 10 more oils of  the man, who will supply that?  opec can do about 3 to 4  million.  the other five or six, right  now, america will not be  meeting that need because we  will not increase our cap ex  budgets.  so, to your point, that has to  be met, and price will always  cause people to produce more.  $90-$100 per barrel is where i  could see opec saying, we will  bring some supply back to the  market but right now in the  american energy space, look how  the stocks did late last year,  kelly.  are you telling me that oil  majors are going to come out  and increase cap ex budgets  massively while investors are  selling their stock?  not a chance.  >> we will see.  i agree with you but that is a  good way to look at the  opportunities from an  interesting point of view.  it might be more north of the  border than here.  yeah?  go ahead.  >> i was just going to add one  more thing, look at the 10 year  treasury moving higher right  now.  people are beginning to worry  about that, we are not near the  liz trust moment where they are  freaking out about it but it is  fun to sit here, kelly, and  watch the 10 year climb higher,  and oil climb higher and people  are losing some money and you  are just smiling ear to ear  with these energy stocks.  i think it is a way to get  rich, when circumstances are  really poor for a lot of  investors.  but again, it is a very narrow  view, but i think it is right.  >> i was just going to say,  cole, ",

        "♪ >>> WELCOME BACK.  PRESIDENT TRUMP HASN'T TAKEN  OFFICE YET BUT WE ARE GETTING  STEADY DEAL NEWS THIS WEEK, USO  MAKING A BID FOR ROOFING.  FROM J&J, ABBY, AND ELI LILLY.  GOLDMAN THINGS IT COULD JUMP  25% NEXT YEAR BUT MY NEXT GUEST  CAUTIONS WE ARE STILL IN A  HONEYMOON PERIOD.  WE WEIGHT WHAT ANTITRUST LOOKS  LIKE UNDER CNBC NEWS .0.   IS THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION,  DAN, WELCOME.  >> PEOPLE ARE SAYING, MOST  LIKELY, THIS IS AN  ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL ALLOW  FOR A LOT OF DEALMAKING TO  HAPPEN BUT THERE IS ALWAYS THE  CHANCE THAT THE NEW REGULATORY  CHAIRS MAYBE TAKE A LITTLE BIT  MORE OF A CAUTIOUS APPROACH.  >> IF YOU LOOK AT THE PEOPLE  TRUMP HAS NOMINATED TO BE AT  ANTITRUST DOJ AND HEAD OF FTC,  NEITHER ONE OF THEM ARE DOVE  WHEN IT COMES TO ANTITRUST.  THERE IS NOT AN EXPECTATION  THAT THEY WILL TAKE AS BROAD AS  AN APPROACH AS THE BIDEN PEOPLE  DID, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR  HISTORIES, THEY ARE PRETTY  TOUGH AND IF YOU GO BACK TO  TRUMP 1.0 AND I THINK A LOT OF  PEOPLE SEEM TO FORGET THIS, HIS  DOJ AND FTC SOUGHT TO BLOCK  DEALS IN ALL SORTS OF  INDUSTRIES, NOT JUST BIG TECH  IT WAS KIND OF ACROSS THE  BOARD.  MORE LAX THAN WHAT BIDEN WAS  BUT IT WAS NOT A GET OUT OF  JAIL FREE CARD FOR EVERYBODY.  >> AND OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A  BOOM IF IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN  FOR A LOT OF THE BANKS AND  GOLDMAN HAS A NICE LIST OF SOME  OF THE CANDIDATES THAT MIGHT BE  NEXT.  THEY ARE PUTTING THE ODDS AT  15% TO 30% SO THESE ARE NOT  SLAM DUNKS.  >> THEY ARE NOT.  AND LET'S REMEMBER, IF WE ARE  HAVING THIS CONVERSATION THIS  TIME LAST YEAR, WE WERE TALKING  ABOUT EXPECTING A HUGE BOOM IN  2024.  DIFFERENT REASONS, BECAUSE WE  WERE EXPECTING LOTS OF RATE  CUTS BUT WE HAD THAT  EXPECTATION.  THE YEAR BEFORE, WE HAD THAT  EXPECTATION.  IN SHORT, BANKERS ALWAYS TALK  ABOUT EXPECTATIONS FOR A BIG  DEAL BOOM BECAUSE THEY WANT  CLIENTS, THEY WANT DEALS.  I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT IS WHY  THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THAT  PARTICULAR REPORT HAVE  EXPECTATIONS OF SUCH QUID PRO  QUO BUT BANKERS ARE GENETICALLY  OPERATED TO TRY TO GET DEALS  GOING AND GET CLIENTS IN THE  DOOR.  >> PRO HAS THE FULL LIST BUT  THERE ARE COMPANIES LIKE  ELECTRONIC ARTS, TRIP ADVISER,  SO ON, SO FORTH.  IT DOES FEEL TO ME, DAN,  SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT.  I THINK WE HAVE HAD MORE  ANNOUNCEMENTS IN THE PAST THREE  WEEKS THAN WHAT I CAN REMEMBER  IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS,  LITERALLY OF LAST YEAR.  SO, MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE I AM  PAYING CLOSER ATTENTION.  WHAT WOULD YOU SAY HAS BEEN THE  ACTUAL PACE, HERE?  >> A LITTLE BIT HARD TO TELL.  I AGREE WITH YOU IT HAS FELT  THAT WAY.  THE REASON I SAY IT IS HARD TO  TELL IS TWO THINGS, YOU TALK  ABOUT THOSE BIOTECH DEALS  ANNOUNCED EARLIER THIS WEEK, A  LOT OF THOSE WERE TIED TO THE  J.P.  MORGAN HEALTHCARE CONFERENCE  AND WE OFTEN SEE BIG DEALS GET  ANNOUNCED AT THE BEGINNING OF  THAT CONFERENCE.  WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THOSE ARE  REALLY SIGNED, PEOPLE WAIT TO  GET THAT OUT ON MONDAY AND  BECAUSE OF THE WAY LAST YEAR  WORKED WITH ALMOST AN ENTIRE  TWO WEEKS OFF WITH CHRISTMAS  AND NEW YEAR'S THE WAY THEY  FELL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK,  YOU BASICALLY HAD NO NEWS COME  OUT AT ALL FOR A COUPLE WEEKS  SO THINGS GOT BACKED UP.  I THINK REALLY FROM MY  PERSPECTIVE, MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY  IS WHERE YOU GET A REAL CHANCE  BECAUSE THOSE DEALS ARE REALLY  THE ONES THAT WE ARE GETTING  NEGOTIATED NOW, NOT ONES THAT  WERE ALREADY IN THE PIPELINE  AND GETTING PAINTED OVER.  >> AND BY THE WAY, THE  INVESTMENT BANKER SHARES HAVE  DONE INCREDIBLY WELL.  YOU LOOK AT PIPER SANDLER, C4,  GOLDMAN, 70%, 80% GAINS OVER  THE PAST YEAR, SO THEY ARE  ANTICIPATING THERE IS GOING TO  BE MORE WORK TO DO.  THE IPOs ARE A PIECE OF THIS,  AS WELL.  I HAVE HEARD PEOPLE IN THE  INDUSTRY SAY YOU ARE LESS LIKELY TO TAKE A COMPANY PUBLIC IF YOU  DON'T THINK THEY WILL BE  ACQUIRED DOWN THE ROAD, IT JUST  PROVIDES MORE STORIES TO TELL,  MORE POSSIBLE EXCERPTS, THAT  KIND OF THING AND ON THAT FRONT  IT HAS BEEN MORE QUIET LATELY.  >> IT HAS BEEN QUIET FOR YEARS  ON THE IPO MARKET AND FOR TWO  YEARS.  ONE, WHEN IT COMES TO THE  PRIVATE TECH STARTUPS, THE  VENTURE CAPITAL STARTUPS, THOSE  ARE THE BUSIEST IPOs.  THERE IS SO MUCH MONEY IN THE  VENTURE CAPITAL MARKET AND LATE  STAGE VENTURE CAPITAL MARKET  AND IN STRUCTURAL CHANGES WHERE  PEOPLE ARE KIND OF BUYING EACH  OTHER OUT AS PRIVATE COMPANIES,  BUT THOSE BIG, BUZZING NAMES  HAVEN'T HAD THE NEED TO COME TO  MARKET LIKE THEY WOULD HAVE IN  THE PAST.  AND THEN, YOU KNOW, PRIVATE  EQUITY FIRMS AND OTHER PRIVATE  COMPANIES THAT SHOULD BE GOING  PUBLIC, THEY HAVE KIND OF BEEN  SCARED OFF FOR A WHILE AND I  THINK IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO  SEE, WE HAVE BEEN IN THE MIDST  OF THIS BULL MARKET, THEY  SHOULD HAVE GONE.  MOST COMPANIES THAT DIDN'T GO  PUBLIC EVEN IN THE PAST YEAR  HAVE PERFORMED REALLY WELL.  THEY PERFORMED WELL ON THE  PRICE AND AND THEY PERFORMED  WELL ON THE AFTERMARKET.  THERE HAS BEEN A BIT OF A LACK  OF COURAGE.  >> IF I WERE A BIG CONGLOMERATE  OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND I WANTED  TO DO A REALLY TRANSFORMATIVE  DEAL, I WOULD DEFINITELY BE  WATCHING WHAT STARTED TO BE  ANNOUNCED, SEE HOW IT GOES  OVER, IF THERE IS ANY USHBACK,  IF THERE IS ANY TRIAL BALLOONS  FLOATED, IF THERE IS ANYTHING  THAT SHOWS UP IN THE MEDIA, AND  IF IT SEEMS LIKE FULL STEAM  AHEAD, MAYBE I'M STARTING TO  PREPARE MY PLANS?  >> I THINK SO.  AND I THINK PARTICULARLY ON THE  TECH SIDE, SOMEBODY IS GOING TO  HAVE TO TAKE A REALLY BIG SWING ",

        "good afternoon and it's a very good afternoon because at long last I can announce a ceasefire and a hostage deal has been reached between Israel and Hamas more than 15 months of conflict I began with hezbollah's brutal Massacre on October the 7th more than 15 months of Terror for the hostages their families the Israeli people more than 15 months of suffering by the innocent people of Gaza fighting in Gaza will stop and soon the hostages will return home to their families the elements of this deal were what I laid out in detail this past May which was embraced by countries around the world and endorsed overwhelmingly by the UN Security Council the deal is structured in three phases phase one will last six weeks it includes a full and complete ceasefire withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the populated areas of Gaza and and the release of a number of hostages held by Hamas including women and elderly and the wounded and I'm proud to say Americans will be part of that hostage release in phase one as well and the vice president and I cannot wait to welcome them home in exchange Israel release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and during phase one the Palestinians can also return to their neighborhoods in all the areas of Gaza and The Surge of humanitarian assistance into the Gaza will begin and the innocent people can have a greater access to these vital supplies you know during the next six weeks Israel will negotiate the necessary arrangements to get phase two which is a permanent end of the war let me say it again a permanent end of the war there are a number of details to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two but the plan says if negotiations take longer than 6 weeks the ceasefire will continue as long as the negotiations continue I spoken to the mayor of Kuwait and the president of Egypt and we have pledged to make sure the negotiations will keep moving forward for as long as it takes then when phase two begins there will be an exchange for release of the remaining living hostages including male soldiers and all remaining Israeli forces will be withdrawn from Gaza and the temporary ceasefire will become permanent and finally phase three any final remains of hostages who have been killed will be returned to their families and a major reconstruction plan plan for Gaza will begin this this is the ceasefire agreement I introduced last spring today Hamas and Israel have agreed to that ceasefire agreement and the whole ending the war you know those of you who have followed the negotiations can attest the road to this deal has not been easy I've worked in foreign policy for decades this is one of the toughest negotiations I've ever experienced and we reached this point because because of the pressure that Israel built on Hamas backed by the United States hamas's longtime leader shoir was killed hamas's strongest supporter Iran launched attacks in Israel and those attacks failed after my Administration organized a coalition of Nations to stop them and after I ordered the US ships and planes to come to Israel's defense we also shape Israel's strong and calibrated response destroying Iran's air defenses but avoiding an escat cycle of an allout War the United States also organized a coalition of 20 countries to stand up to attacks by the houthis including their missile attacks in Israel then Hezbollah another of hamas's strongest backers was significantly weakened on the battlefield and its leadership was destroyed with our support is is Israel negotiated a ceasefire with them and after that Lebanon finally elected a new president who's not who's not beholding Hezbollah and he can began a new chapter for the Lebanese people all told these developments in the region which the United States helped to shape changed the equation and so now the terror Network that once protected and sustained Hamas is far weaker Iran is weaker Iran is weak weer than has been in decades Hezbollah is badly degraded and after more than 15 months of War amasa senior leaders are dead thousands of mos Fighters are dead and the military formations have been destroyed with nowhere to turn MOS finally agreed to releasing hostages you know there was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal and I'm deeply satisfied this day has come finally come for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting in agony and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable Devastation because of the war the Palestinian people have gone through hell too many innocent people have died too many communities have been destroyed and this deal the people of Gaza can finally recover and rebuild they can look to to a future without Hamas in power you know the Bible says blessed are the peacemakers many peacemakers help make this ill happen including an extraordinary team of American diplomats who have worked nonstop for months to get this done secretary blinkin led the effort secretary Jake Sullivan is it not Nation security adviser Jake Sullivan Bill burn John fer Brett mcer OS Hawkin and vice president work relentlessly as we work to deliver this deal I'd also note this deal was developed and negotiated under my Administration but its terms will be implemented for the most part by the next Administration in these past few days we've been speaking as one team this has been time of real turmoil in the Middle East but as I prepare to leave office our friends are strong our enemies are weak and there's a genuine opportunities for a new future in Lebanon There's an opportunity for future free from the grip of Hezbollah in Syria a future free from the tyranny of Assad and for the Palestinian people a credible credible Pathway to a state of their own and for the region a future of normalization integration of Israel and all its Arab neighbors including Saudi Arabia at the G20 in Delhi in September 23 I rallied key countries behind a vision of an economic Carter from India across the Middle East to Europe that Vision can now become a reality there are risk as well including Isis and Iran even in a badly weakened state but but we're handing off them to the next team a real opportunity for a better future for the Middle East I hope they will take it let me close with this my my friend for years in the United States Senate former Senator George Mitchell who did so much to forge peace in Northern isand once said about diplomacy said it is a 700 days of failure and one day success 700 days of failure and one day of success well we've had many difficult days since Zas began this terrible War we've encountered roadblocks and setbacks we've not given up and now after more than 4 400 Days of struggle a day success has arrived God bless all the hostages and their families may God protect the troops of all those who work for peace Gaza now as you were saying the implementation of this deal will be in the hands of the next Administration and basically they will shakee the future of Gaza so how do you see this future and also uh how much credit do you give to the Trump team for this deal Trump is already taking credit for it well you know uh this is the exact framework of the deal I proposed back in May exact and uh and we got the world to endorse it secondly it's America support for Israel that helped them uh badly weaken amas and as backers and uh create the conditions for this deal and thirdly uh I knew this deal would have to be implemented by the next team so uh I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice because that's what American presidents do will be in the um how many Americans will be released when the hostages are being released all the exact detail of how many people are being held how many bodies will being turned unless will all be forthcoming all of it all of it thank you will hold I'm confident who book's credit for this Mr President you or Trump is that a joke oh thank you for",

JULIA, STEVE, THANKS FOR  >>> MEANTIME, VERY UPBEAT START  TO EARNINGS SEASON WITH THE  BANKS TODAY, GPM, CITI,  GOLDMAN, ALL MEETING ON THE TOP  AND BOTTOM LINE, NOW UP 1 1/2%  AS A RESULT.   LET'S BRING IN ERIKA NAJARIAN  AN ANALYST COVERING THIS SPACE.  ERIKA, THIS IS WITH HIGH  EXPECTATIONS, AS WE HEARD  YESTERDAY, THE FINANCIALS WITH  AREA ALONG WITH EXPECTING TO  POST THE HIGHEST EARNINGS  GROWTH AND THEY ARE HEARING  THAT FAR.  HOW SO?  >> A COUPLE THINGS, BALANCE  SHEET IS BETTER BECAUSE DEPOSIT  GROWTH IS COMING BACK, CARD  GROWTH CONTINUES TO BE PRETTY  GOOD AND ABOVE NORMAL AND  OBVIOUSLY CAPITAL MARKETS  ACTIVITY IS REALLY COMING OFF  OF LOWS, BUT THE OTHER THING  IS, TOO, BANKS ARE ABLE TO  REPRICE THOSE DEPOSITS DOWN AS  THEY REFLECT THE CUTS THAT WE  HAVE HAD ON THEIR NET INTEREST  MARGINS.  >> AND CITI AND WELLS AND   RETICULAR AS I AM WATCHING,  PARTICULARLY DRIFTING HIGHER.  WHAT DID INVESTORS HERE, TO  KIND OF DIGEST?  USUALLY IT IS THE OPPOSITE, YOU  GET A NICE REACTION AND THEN  THEY MODERATE THAT THEY ARE  PICKING UP SOME STEAM.  >> SO, WHAT CITI AND WELLS  IS  REFLECTING IS ENTIRELY OUTSIDE  OF MACRO, IT IS THOSE  INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES GETTING  BETTER.  SO, FOR CITI IN PARTICULAR,  THEY ACTUALLY  LOWERED THEIR  RETURN TARGETS FOR 2026, BUT  THEY WENT OUT THERE AND SAID,  LOOK, WE ARE GOING TO BUY BACK ABOUT $20 BILLION, OR 15% OF  OUR MARKET CAP TO TIDE YOU  OVER.  AND WHEN YOUR STOCK IS TRADING  THAT MUCH BELOW BOOK VALUE,  THAT IS IMPACTFUL FOR  INVESTORS.  AND FOR WELLS FARGO, YOU KNOW,  CLEARLY, THAT HAS A MAKEOVER  STORY, AS WELL, ON THE  REGULATORY SIDE, BUT THIS  QUARTER'S RESULTS REALLY SORT  OF SHOWED INVESTORS THAT THEY  ARE PAST BEING A REMEDIATION  STORY AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE  A LONGER-TERM RETURN STORY,  WHERE THEY COULD POTENTIALLY  EARN MORE THAN THEIR MIDTERM  TARGET OF 15% TANGIBLE ARE OKAY. SO, WHAT YOU ARE SEEING ON THE  SCREEN ARE REALLY THOSE  INDIVIDUAL BANKS GOING FROM  CHALLENGE TO BETTER.  >> SO, J.P.  MORGAN, LET'S NOT MAKE TOO MUCH  OF IT, BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE  QUITE THE SAME PATH IN THE  SHARES TODAY, OF A PERCENTAGE  OR TWO, AND IS THAT JUST  BECAUSE OF SIZE?  THEY PUT IN STRONG RESULTS,  MAYBE A BIT OF THE BLACKROCK  PHENOMENA, ALTHOUGH BLACKROCK  WAS UP 6%.  >> PART OF IT MAY BE  WE ARE  JUST SO SPOILT TO J.P.  MORGAN SPEED AND RAISE AND  OBVIOUSLY THE VALUATION THERE  IS MUCH HIGHER THERE FOR NOW  VERSUS WELLS, AND CITI, AND  BANK OF AMERICA, SO THAT IS A  LITTLE BIT OF A CEILING ON  PERFORMANCE, TOO.  BUT,  HONESTLY, I THINK THE  INVESTORS ARE SORT OF WAITING  TO SEE WHAT THE COMPANY WILL DO  TO UNLOCK ALL THAT EXCESS  CAPITAL.  THE PRINTED SOMETHING LIKE  15.7% CAPITAL, KELLY, AND THAT  IS HUGE.  THAT IS A HUGE LEVEL OF EXCESS.  AND IF WE ARE REALLY GOING TO  BE IN A DEREGULATORY TYPE OF  YEAR, THEN THE DEFINITION OF  \"EXCESS\" COULD BE EVEN WIDER  EVEN FOR J.P.  MORGAN.  >> SO, WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO  DO, DO YOU THINK?  >> I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO  GROW, GROW, GROW AND THAT IS SO  FUNNY BECAUSE THE WORD \"GROW\"  IS NOT USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH  THANKS, BUT GIVEN WHERE THE  STOCK IS RELATIVE TO BOOKS, I  THINK THE COMPANY'S PRIORITY  IS, LET'S CONTINUE TO BUILD A  MOAT AROUND THIS BUSINESS.  THE FACT THAT THEY ARE THE  LARGEST BANK IN THE WORLD AND  THEY HAVE TO HOLD THE LARGEST  AMOUNT OF CAPITAL AND THEY CAN  INCUR 20% OFF OF IT, IT IS  AMAZING AND I THINK THEY ARE  TAKING THOSE EARNINGS AND  CONTINUING TO BUILD A WIDE MOAT  AROUND THE COMPANY.

        "SO, KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE ONE  AND A HALF POINT GAINS ALL THE  WAY UP TO NEARLY 7% FOR  CITIGROUP AND RIGHT NOW ONE OF  THE BEST PERFORMERS IN THE  ENTIRE FINANCIAL SECTOR.  KEEP IT ON THE BIG BANKS,  EITHER WILL SEND IT BACK OVER  TO YOU.  >>> IT IS DAY TWO NOW A BETTER  THAN EXPECTED INFLATION  REPORTS.  CORE CPI IN PARTICULAR, LOWER  THAN EXPECTED.  SHELTER, A STICKING POINT,  POSTING ITS SMALLEST YEARLY  GAIN IN THREE YEARS, SO DOES  THIS PUT A RATE CUT BACK ON THE  TABLE?  MAYBE A COUPLE OF THEM AND  MAYBE BEFORE THE SECOND HALF.  LET'S ASK JULIA CORONADO, THE  FOUNDER OF POLICY PERSPECTIVES  AND SENIOR CNBC  REPORTER.  STEVE, I HATE TO DO THIS RIGHT  AWAY, BUT -- WE MET TWO IN A  ROW.  >> NOT BAD.  LOOK AT THE REACTION.  WHAT ARE THE ODDS FOR RATE CUTS  AT THIS POINT?  >> LET'S PUT THEM UP RIGHT  AWAY, WE JUST REFRESHED THE  CHART AND THEY ARE HIGHER, BUT  THEY ARE NOT HIGH IN THE SENSE  THAT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT IT,  I MEAN, EVERYTHING UNTIL MAY IS  STILL BELOW 50%.  YOU GET TO JUNE, YOU ARE AT  63%, WHICH IS BETTER THAN 50,  BUT IT IS NOT TREMENDOUS  CONVICTION.  AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS,  FOLKS, IF YOU ARE ON THE RADIO,  IT GOES MAY, JUNE, AND IN  DECEMBER FOR THE SECOND CUT.  SO, JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT  DECEMBER 2nd, WE ARE LOOKING AT  THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER CUT  AFTER THAT AND THAT IS STILL  BELOW 50% AND PERSONALLY, I  THINK THAT IS RIGHT.  I THINK THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY  TO PRICE THIS IN THE SENSE,  OBVIOUSLY, WE WANT TO HEAR FROM  JULIA, IT IS A GOOD NUMBER,  THERE MIGHT BE MORE GOOD  NUMBERS TO COME BUT THE ISSUE  HERE IS THERE IS A LOT OF  UNCERTAINTY.  WE HAVE TO START AN ACCOUNT  AGAIN ABOUT THE ED BEING  CONFIDENT ABOUT 2% INFLATION.  >> JULIA, WEIGH IN HERE?  >> I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT  ASSESSMENT.  I THINK THE FED HAS CLEARLY  SIGNALED AND WE HAVE GOTTEN A  FLURRY OF FED BEAKERS INCLUDING  VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS THIS  MORNING, INDICATING THAT THEY  ARE PATIENT RIGHT NOW.  WE HAVE SEEN IMPORTANTLY THAT  THE LABOR MARKET HAS  STABILIZED, ONE OF THE THINGS  THAT REALLY KICKED THEM INTO  HIGH GEAR, LAST FALL, WAS SIGNS  THAT THE LABOR MARKET WAS  WEAKENING.  SINCE THEN, THAT HAS IMPROVED.  THE LAST JOB REPORT WAS REALLY  FANTASTIC ACROSS THE BOARD,  INCLUDING SOME NEW WAGE GAINS,  SO THERE IS NO INFLATIONARY  WORRIES.  BUT, A LOT OF RESILIENCY IN THE  ECONOMY.  SO, AS LONG AS THE ECONOMY IS  RESILIENT, AND STEVE ALLUDED TO  SOME OF THE UPSIDE RISKS TO  INFLATION FROM POLICIES LIKE  TARIFFS, AND REDUCED  IMMIGRATION, YOU KNOW, THE FED  HAS THE LUXURY TO JUST WAIT AND  SEE, AND TAKE ITS TIME.  SO, I THINK A JUNE RATE CUT,  THAT IS OUR BASELINE, WE WILL  SEE THE FIRST RATE CUT IN JUNE  AND BETWEEN NOW AND THEN, THEY  ARE JUST GOING TO BE IN WAIT  AND SEE MODE UNTIL THEY GAUGE  WHAT POLICIES WILL BE  FORTHCOMING.  >> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT IS A SIGH  OF RELIEF, STEVE, BECAUSE A LOT  OF THE INFLATION DATA AND  EVERYTHING GOING ON IN THE  MARKET IN RECENT WEEKS HAVE  REALLY BEEN A LOT MORE HAWKISH.  EVEN THIS REPRICING OF RATE  CUTS, NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT  RATE HIKES.  BRING ME UP TO SPEED?  I HAVE SEEN WILLIAMS' HEADLINES  AND SO FORTH, WHAT IS THE  LATEST?  >> JOHN WILLIAMS IS CONFIDENT  THEY ARE GOING TO BRING THE  INFLATION RATE DOWN TO 2%, BUT  THEY SAY IT IS GOING TO TAKE  SOME TIME AND IT COULD BE  CHOPPY ALONG THE WAY.  WE HAVE A COUPLE OF FULL  SCREENS THAT I BROUGHT.  ONE IS ON, GUYS, THE ONE THAT  LOOKS AT INFLATION PROGRESS ON  THE HEADLINE.  I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHY IT IS  THE FED HAS BECOME A LITTLE BIT  MORE RELUCTANT, AND WHAT THAT  SHOWS IS THE PROGRESS HAS  STALLED.  OKAY?  THIS IS THE HEADLINE.  LOOK AT WHAT WE DID.  WE WENT FROM -- I HAVE TO TURN  AROUND -- 926.4.  THAT IS A JUMP.  AND 6.4 TO 3.3 IN A YEAR?  AND THEN, WE DID A VERY  LACKLUSTER 0.4.  YOU CAN SEE THE SAME THING WITH  THE NEXT PROGRESS ON THE CORE  RATE.  AND THAT IS, AGAIN, WE GOT A  BETTER NUMBER TODAY, BUT IF YOU  LOOK AT THE NEXT ONE, SHOWING  IN THE BACK THERE, OBVIOUSLY  THESE ARE FAR TO FALL BUT WE  DID A NICE JUMP FROM DECEMBER  '22 TO DECEMBER '23, AND THEN  WE DID 0.7 LAST YEAR, THAT IS  PRETTY GOOD, BUT THE POINT WITH  THIS ONE IS HOW MUCH ABOVE 3%  IT REMAINS.  NOW, TAKE OFF A HALF TO GET TO  THE BCE, THAT IS A GOOD  BENCHMARK, RIGHT?  >> SURE.  >> SO, YOU ARE STILL ON THE  HIGH TWOS WHEN IT COMES TO BCE.  LET'S ASK JULIA IF SHE HAS A  NUMBER, I SAW PEOPLE PENCIL IN A 0.13 AND A 0.18.  THAT WOULD GIVE YOU ON THE  CORE, 2.8% YEAR-OVER-YEAR FOR  THE PCE.  >> FOR THE FED, SO PEOPLE ARE  TRACKING THIS, JULIA, THE CPI  IS THE BIG HEADLINE, ONE THAT  MIGHT MATTER IF YOU ARE ON  SOCIAL SECURITY, BUT THE  PERSONAL EXPENDITURE GAUGE IS A  LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE AND  DYNAMIC, I GUESS, FOR LACK OF A  BETTER WORD.  THE FED LIKES TO FOLLOW IT.  PEOPLE ARE TAKING FROM  YESTERDAY AND TODAY AND SAYING,  HEY, WE MIGHT ONLY BE UP A  LITTLE BIT MORE THAN A 10th ON  THIS READING WHICH I THINK IS  WHAT HAPPENED LAST MONTH.  >> YEAH, AND THEY HAVE BEEN  MORE BENIGN AND WE ARE MORE IN  THE RANGE THAT STEVE CITED, 1.6  FOR CORE PCE, WHICH IS  MANDATED, CONSISTENT, AND  DESIGN, AND WE HAVE THE ANNUAL  RATE AT 2.4%.  SO, THAT IS ALL GOOD NEWS.  I THINK ONE OF THE RISK FACTORS  IN THE VERY NEAR FIRMS ARE THE  Q1 PRICE RESETS.  SO, LAST YEAR, WE SAW PROGRESS  STALL OUT AS WE GOT A BUNCH OF  PRICE RESETS AT THE BEGINNING  OF THE YEAR, BOTH IN JANUARY  AND THEN IN MARCH, SO I THINK  GIVEN THAT BACKDROP, THE FED  MAY, AND GIVEN THE RESILIENCY  IN THE ECONOMY, THE FED CAN  KIND OF GATHER THE INFORMATION  ON THE PRICE RESETS, THE  BEGINNING OF YOUR PRICE RESETS.  IF THEY ARE LESS THAN LAST  YEAR, THEY COULD STILL BE  STRONG, BUT IF THEY ARE LESS  THAN LAST YEAR, THEN WE COULD  SEE A JUMP DOWN IN THE ANNUAL  RATE A",

        "Eamon. An important day, an emotional  one for many as we learned on  our own desk today as the news  was first breaking on halftime  report today. >> we'll turn our attention back to the market. Can we show an intraday here  once again or a current picture  of the three majors? because we continue to have a  bit more pickup in the activity  today in stocks. Nasdaq is good for more than 2%. You see 2.1%, there's the s&p  500 trying to get back toward  6,000 and the dow is up 1.5%. We told you we were going to  focus with our resident expert  jenny harrington on dividends  because investors have high  hopes for 2025 following a year  that modestly underperformed the s&p 500. Jenny harrington among those who are optimistic coming into this  year, debating dividends was the focus of a cent segment we did with josh brown, who questioned  using dividend investing as a  sole strategy was good. >> i am pro dividend. 75% of companies in the s&p 500  do pay a dividend. When you actually analyze it as  a stand-alone factor, 54% of the time it trails the performance  of the s&p 500 over all 12-month rolling periods going back 30  years. >> part of the point he also  made is that companies have  changed the way they return  capital to shareholders focusing more heavily on things like  buybacks which help stock prices more. Plus you risk missing out on  great companies like amazon or  berkshire, and they don't pay  dividends. I wanted to get your take on  this because, again, you are our expert. Okay. And i know that there are a lot  of people watching who buy  stocks for the dividends. What's your not so much defense  of dividend investing but why  this works and who it works best for. >> so to be really clear, it is  not for everyone. Most people don't need income,  but if you do need income, it  works really, really well. That's a pretty niche strategy. Sometimes it's a retiree,  sometimes it's just someone who  likes to see some component of  their total portfolio rolling in day after day. In my case, most of moy clients  don't have 100% of their  portfolio in the dividend income strategy. They're not missing out on an  amazon or microsoft. It's just different silos. Frequently people use it, again, for that silo to replace the  income or to diversify their  overall portfolio. We know when we led in and we  said investors are looking  toward 2025 as a good year for  dividends, i think the reality  is every year is a good year for dividends. If you are a dividend investor,  you know you're getting your  income and are in a good  strategy, a well managed  strategy that is consistent,  that looks for consistent  dividend income. You know that's coming in. What's really cool is s&p 500  dividends since like the last  50, 60 years have grown at about 5.7%. If you need that income and you  want that income to outpace  inflation, it's doing that. Can found the same for my  strategy which isn't s&p  specific. In addition, you have a tax  advantage tax stream. If you buy treasuries or  corporate bonds, you have an  ordinary income tax, dividends  are getting 15% or 20% tax rate  on them. But the thing about all that is  i think what we all know really  well here is the single best  investor is one who behaves  well. You can be in high growth, but  if you freak out at the wrong  time, if you switch strategies  at the wrong time, it can  destroy years of good returns. Generally what happens for  dividend investors is they get  hooked on the income. They know if they sell, even if  it's march of 2020 or late 2022  when the market is down, they  know if they're sell, they're  cutting off all their income. That consistent income stream  leads to very good behavior. It acts as a huge emotional  source of comfort for investors. All those things people have  going for it. One of the other things josh  talked about on the show the  other day is what kinds of  companies pay big dividends. Sometimes it's stocks like  u.p.s. Like we talked about  before where the share price is  off its high, but there are a  lot of companies out there too  where that return of capital  decision is saying look, we  don't have huge growth  opportunities ahead. We just have really high free  cash flow. Let's make that our return to  shareholders. Let's incentative shareholders. If you look at aries capital. That's an 8% return. He doesn't say to shareholders,  i expect this stock to double. He says you're going to get this 8% return. That's our goal to give to you. In my portfolio, i have  enterprise products. I have org anon, which is the  health care spin-off from merck. Lamar advertising. Those have 6, 7, and 4% dividend yields and those management  teams, their whole goal is to  return shareholder value in the  form of a dividend. You can't just chase a high  yeld, and one of the things too  people get caught up is the  difference between dividend  growth and dividend income. So dividend growth, you can look at a company like apple,  microsoft, meta, google. Those are dividend growth. They actually just started  paying dividends. That's very different than what  i own. So it's a strategy that works  well for the right people. Yeah. Sorry. One more thing? i'm rolling a little too fast  here. >> it's all right. >> thanks. Right now when we think about  the outlook for 2025, and  everywhere i'm reading goldman,  bank of america. Everybody is saying diversify  out. When we look at the s&p 500, ten stocks make up 39% of that  index. That's really, really  concentrated. When you look outside, this  isn't really dividend specific. This is whether you want to be  in small cap or value. Anywhere you get outside of the  s&p 500, it's not as  concentrated. And so if you do want to take a  step back from that  concentration, there are other  areas.",

We're down to low single digits. >> want to give me something on  unitedhealth? that's tomorrow before the bell. >> it's a coin toss. >> why do you say begrudgingly? you don't have much confidence? >> i have no real confidence in  the quarter which is why i have  a small position there. So if the stock trades out  differently, these are been  trading down almost 10% over the first day and ensuing days, i  would use it as a buying  opportunity. There are new regulations that  have come in that ha",

        "and welcome to the very first hearing of the Senate energy and natural resources committee during the 119th Congress really is a privilege to serve in this capacity uh as chairman during such a pivotal moment in our nation's history uh particularly as it relates to our nation's energy policies Mr Wright thank you so much for joining us uh joining us no uh no less on your birthday now uh uh people you don't turn 30 twice in a lifetime but can count today is your second 30th birthday if you'd prefer um I see that you're here with family and uh really enjoyed meeting each of them and we'll uh look forward to hearing you introduce them in a moment when we hear from you your nomination in many ways really couldn't becoming at a more urgent time over the past four years Americans have suffered under a lot of policies that have made life more difficult more uncertain and more expensive Energy prices have soared driving up the cost of not only energy itself but everything around it everything from housing to Health Care from gas to groceries and as a result families have struggled to make ends meat to to make ends meet as it turns out you need energy to do just about everything and when the cost of energy goes up the cost uh of everything else does too the Biden Administration has completely failed to recognize the fundament fundamental role that energy plays in our Liv lives and the devastating consequences of excessive and unwise government intervention from the cost of goods to the strength of Our National Defense uh affordable and reliable energy is the backbone of our economy and even our way of life now America is of course blessed with an abundant supply of Natural Resources uh we're blessed with oil and gas with coal with even with nuclear and the uity behind that with geothermal with hydropower with wind and solar and it's our responsibility to figure out how to harness these things safely affordably and effectively unfortunately the Biden Administration has done the exact opposite of those things on his very first day in office President Biden halted new oil and natural gas leases on public lands and Waters effectively cutting off access to resources that could have powered our economy and benefited the lives of ordinary Americans over the p last four years the same Administration has dismantled domestic energy production canel leases and weaponized regulations to discourage investment in pipelines and critical energy infrastructure instead of unleashing American Energy uh this uh Administration has in instead um uh decided to reduce our access to energy and they've reduced many of these tools within the department of energy uh to to a political tool for advancing extreme climate policies policies that prioritize ideology over Innovation security and affordability these failures have caused devastating harm skyrocketing Energy prices don't just hit consumers at the pump they raise the cost of manufacturing transportation and everything in between the Strategic petroleum Reserve has been recklessly drained to Historic lows these policies have eroded our energy Independence as a country making us dangerously and unwisely reliant on foreign suppliers including some adversarial Nations this is why today's hearing is I think so important the department of Energy's responsibilities are vast maintaining our nuclear stockpile fostering Innovation through research and development and ensuring affordable reliable energy for the people if confirmed Mr Wright you'll lead an agency with the potential to trans form our Energy Future for the better your track record as the founder and leader of Liberty Energy speaks volumes about your qualifications and about the expertise and knowhow that you'd bring to the job you understand the energy sector and the many challenges that it faes including and especially those from the government I'm eager to hear your plans for refocusing the Department of energy on what ought to be its core Mission ensuring energy security driving Innovation and lowering costs for American families American Energy security is American National Security you cannot separate them they are inextricably intertwined producing more energy here at home is a national imperative and I look forward to working with you and your colleagues at the people you will work with at the department of energy as well as my colleagues here on this committee to ensure that the department of energy uh returns to its founding and all important purpose Mr Wright the challenges you will face as sec AR of energy are significant but so was the opportunity to restore America's standing as an energy superpower I'm looking forward to the beginning of a collaborative effort to start a new course for our nation's energy policy thank you for your willingness to serve and I look forward to today's discussion we'll turn now and hear now from our ranking member Senator hinr thank you chairman Lee um and I want to welcome the new members of of this committee as well as returning members uh and happy birthday Mr Wright uh it's an honor to address you today as a newly appointed ranking member of this committee and I am honored to represent a state whose economy and whose identity are really so deeply connected to Doe's Mission Sandy and Los Alamos rank among the uh State's largest employers offering stable mission-driven jobs to nearly 30,000 people in 2023 their combined economic impact on my state reached nearly $9 billion and these Investments have fueled research development and scientific progress driving Global advancements in fields such as nuclear science cyber security clean energy and Material Science now before continuing my remarks I must express my disappointment uh that the chair has decided to move forward with this hearing over my objection um given the fact that Mr Wright your uh ethics and financial materials arrived yesterday after business hours uh I appreciate your responsiveness to my questions uh your willingness to meet with me but I don't think it is too much to ask that members of this committee get 24 hours to review those documents uh Mr Wright it's un fortunate that our first order of business involved breaking committee precedents nevertheless because my concerns have gone unheated uh we will proceed today some secretaries in the past have been surprised to learn that roughly half of Doe's budget supports the nation's nuclear security Enterprise through the national nuclear Security Administration and the cleanup of Legacy nuclear waste from weapons produced during the Cold War through the Office of Environmental Management and although only a fraction of its budget goes to Energy Research doe is still the single largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences not just through the office of science but also through the title 17 clean energy financing program and the advanced research projects agency the Secretary of Energy must recognize the importance of Doe's research and development programs and the at the National Labs and not just for energy production but also for efficient energy use National Security cyber security climate change and maintaining our position of leadership in the world the Secretary of Energy must also adapt to a rapidly evolving energy landscape driven by three empirical Trends first El electricity demand is growing for the first time in decades advances in generative artificial intelligence Technologies and investments in manufacturing and data centers are driving up electricity demand in fact Nationwide electric demand is expected to grow by 15% in just the next 5 years second distributed renewable energy is getting cheaper the deployment of renewable energy continues to accelerate exponentially not in a linear fashion and consistently outpaces eia predictions year-over-year the pace of this deployment is driving down energy costs giving Americans more energy freedom to choose how they want to heat and cool their homes or fuel their cars and trucks third clean energy is driving economic growth according to the International Energy agency clean energy accounted for 10% of global GDP growth in 2023 if confirmed Mr Wright you will inherit a department that has received historic levels of investment to fund programs and policies that are literally transforming the US economy these programs and policies were authorized by Landmark legislation including the energy Act of 2020 the chips and science act the infrastructure investment and jobs Act and the inflation reduction act and those Investments are paying off two years after chips and science companies have announced more than $395 billion of investments in semiconductors and electronics and the creation of over 115,000 and jobs primarily in manufacturing two years after passage of the inflation reduction act businesses including battery manufacturers and auto companies have announced $493 billion of Investments a 71% increase from the two-year period preceding that legislation and three years after the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure law the administration announced $568 billion in projects for over over 66,000 projects across our country these Landmark laws give the Secretary of Energy new resources and authorities to implement programs and policies that will unlock hundreds of gigawatts worth of solar wind and grid battery projects that have been stuck in interconnection cues all around the country this hearing will provide you with the opportunity to demonstrate to the committee that you will Implement congress's vision of inter energy abundance and enforce and uphold the laws of the land I look forward to this discussion uh thank you Senator Hinrich and to be clear we did follow the rules of the committee and um they did not arrive after business hours they arrived at 5:40 p.m. the bipartisan front office of the committee is in fact open till 6 p.m. and so uh those came during business hours we're now going to hear from Senator hicken Looper who will be introducing secretary Wright or uh Mr Wright soon to be secretary rightwe thank you Mr chair ranking member Hinrich um um as someone I've known for a number of years I first met Chris uh at a fundraising effort for uh scholarships for needy kids um we share the fact that we both married way over our heads his wife Liz is behind him uh and uh like my wife Robin is far out chines him in many regards uh Chris won't be surprised to hear me say that we disagree on a lot of things and we we're almost legendary probably 12 or 13 years ago at a fancy Easter dinner in the middle of the day and getting rather heated over some of the issues around energy and I think what was interesting my wife was very worried about our hosts and and us being invited back whereas I don't think Chris and I took any offense at all uh H and I think that you know some people will be surprised that I'm uh introducing him here and yet he's a scientist who has in invested his life uh around energy uh and he is indeed an unrestrained Enthusiast uh for fossil fuels in in almost every regard but he studied nuclear he went started out at University of Colorado just for perfectly clear uh but somehow he got ended up at MIT one of my associates is known to have haunted uh and he studied nuclear there in detail got a got a masters uh his first years working were in solar uh he has experience in Wind uh he is a a practitioner and and a and a key innovator around geothermal and the incredible potential that we have in geothermal um uh he is a scientist who is open to discussion uh and he is uh again a scientist who is an a successful entrepreneur and and has that ability to assess what is possible and what isn't uh again I am well known for the last 40 years I've been worried and working to address climate change and I worry about the acceleration of the feed feedback loops it could make what we saw in in Los Angeles over the past uh couple weeks uh a Grim foreshadowing of of other events that could come uh but I think that what we're looking at now is the need for a comprehensive approach to energy uh at every regard um Chris has spent a lot of time looking at poverty not just in this country but around the world and how energy affects that uh and how it affects the the health of of people from in different countries uh he is fully first on uh the assessments we've made uh both on this committee and as a congress in the past couple years to make investments around energy um and he respects that uh and I think as we go forward uh I look forward to continuing the robust discussions uh and I'm not going to hold back and I know that he won't hold back either and I think that's part of the key of a democracy is to be able to sit down and really thrash out your your beliefs and what the facts are and be able to measure them I think we both learned and evolved over the years on a number of issues and and I have high optimism we can work together um and I look forward to figuring out what are the best ways and the fastest ways we can address the the climate challenges we face so Chris thank you for for being willing to do this public service uh and I look forward to the discussion we'll hear next from uh senator hovind thank you chairman Lee and also uh ranking member Hinrich um welcome welcome to you Chris and and your family um it it's great to meet all of you I think it's fantastic uh that you're here and of course Li is very important that you're here that was obvious right away when he came in and give you that huge hug uh moral support is unbelievable and then to have your mom here is pretty cool on your birthday 60th birthday and as far as your grandson miles you know seven months but it's never too too soon to start you know getting used to Senate hearings so I think bringing him and kind of getting him used to uh what goes on is great uh I'm really pleased to follow up Senator hicken Looper I have great respect for him your hom state senator he's a train geologist he knows energy and he's worked and helped me on uh a lot of things and I'm very pleased to uh to join you in in this introduction and really it's appropriate because you you live in Colorado but an awful lot of your work's been down in North Dakota in my state of North Dakota and you've had a huge huge impact when I started as governor in North Dakota in 2001 we produced 100,000 we less than 100,000 barrels of oil and it was going down it was going down because we're drilling 14,000 foot vertical Wells there were more costeffective places to do it so I started a policy called Empower North Dakota and it wasn't just about producing more oil and gas it was about producing energy as Senator Hickenlooper said from all sources and we do in North Dakota now we are a Powerhouse energy and you know it well but it came from creating the right climate the right legal tax and Regulatory climate to encourage energy development and it came down to getting entrepreneurs great thinkers people who were smart well- Tred and motivated people who'd gone to places like MIT and Berkeley and had the latest greatest understanding of Technologies and all kind of things people who would create companies uh let's see like pinnacle technologies that started the hydraulic fracturing mapping industry so folks could figure out where the energy was and then folks that shed companies like stoud energy and then started their own companies uh like Liberty Energy to to actually do it to unlock this energy potential here and do it with the best environmental stewardship the smallest footprint right and as a result of folks like that North Daka went from less than 100,000 barrels of oil going down to 1.5 million barrels a day 1.5 million barrels of oil a day not to mention all the natural gas with the best environmental stewardship in the world and the reality is you're that entrepreneur I'm talking about right now you and others and that's what we're talking about so if we really want and all the above we need guys like you Chris that really understand energy all aspects of energy whether it's as one of my favorite presidents used to say nuclear energy or oil and gas or anything else you have that incredible knowledge and understanding and uh capability to drive this technology to truly make us energy dominant and that's what we need to focus on you know uh regardless of what kind of energy you may or may not favor to truly have all the above we need to continue to drive that technology curve and I can't think of anyone better uh able to do that based on your training your education your interest your accomplishments and your experience and I'm just willing that you're I'm just pleased that you're willing you and your family are willing to stand up and serve thank you so much for being here today appreciate it thank you Mr chair thanks so much um Mr Wright we will um we're now going to swear you in if you will stand uh and I'll ad minister of the oath you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give to the senate committee on energy and natural resources will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth I do thank you now um I will now ask you three questions before you turn to your opening statement three questions that we asked to each uh nominee before this committee will you be available to appear before the committee and other congressional committees to represent the department positions and respond to issues of concern to Congress I will are you aware of any personal Holdings Investments or interests that could constitute a conflict of interest to create or or create the appearance of such a conflict should you be confirmed and assume the office to which you've been nominated by the president I am not are you involved or do you have any assets held in a blind Trust I do not thank you um now uh U you may proceed with your opening statement thank you thank you Mr chairman ranking member Heinrich and members of the committee thank you also to Senator Hickenlooper and senator hovind for your kind remarks friendship and for your continued service to our Centennial state and great nation before I begin my remarks I would like to recognize the members of my family who have joined me today my wife Liz my daughter Skyler and her husband Greg my seven-month-old grandson's mile miles my son Arthur his fiance ala also in the crowd not needing identification is my mother Gayla Sister Kim many other extended family and friends as well the most fortunate event in my very fortunate life was meeting my life wife Liz when I was 18 years old I came home that night and told my sister that I had met the woman that I would marry it is truly an honor to appear before this committee as president-elect Trump's nominee for Secretary of Energy I am humbled by the great responsibility this position holds America has is has an historic opportunity to secure our Energy Systems deliver leadership and scientific technological innovation Steward our weapon stockpiles and meet Cold War Legacy waste commitments I call myself a science geek turned tech nerd turned lifelong energy entrepreneur my fascination with energy started at a young age in Denver Colorado I enrolled at MIT specifically to work on Fusion Energy I started graduate school at UC Berkeley where I worked on solar energy as well as Power Electronics energy is the essential Agent of Change that enables everything that we do everything a low energy Society is poor a highly energized Society can bring health wealth and opportunity for all the stated mission of the company that I founded Liberty Energy is to better human lives through energy Liberty Works directly in oil natural gas next generation geothermal and has Partnerships in Next Generation nuclear energy and new Battery Technology Energy has been a lifelong passion of mine la la destroy energy has been a lifelong passion of mine and I've never been shy about that fact then again I've never been shy about much president Trump shares my passion for energy and if confirmed I will work tirelessly to implement his bold agenda as an unabashed Steward for all sources of affordable reliable and secure American Energy I see three immediate tasks where I will focus my attention if I get the privilege of being confirmed the first is to unleash American Energy at home and abroad to restore our energy dominance the security of our nation begins with energy previous administrations have viewed energy as a liability instead of the immense National Asset that it is to compete globally we must expand energy production including commercial nuclear and liquefied natural gas and cut the cost of energy for Americans second we must lead the world in Innovation and Technology breakthroughs throughout my lifetime technology and innov have immeasurably enhanced The Human Condition we must protect and accelerate the work of the Department's National Laboratory Network to sure to secure America's competitive advantage and its security I commit to working with Congress on the important missions of the National Laboratories third we must build things in America again and remove barriers to progress Federal policies today make it too easy to stop projects s and very hard hard to start and complete projects this makes energy more expensive and less reliable president Trump is committed to lowering energy costs and to do so we must prioritize cutting red tape enabling the private sector Investments and building the infrastructure we need to make energy more affordable for families and businesses I've met with almost every member of the committee and I appreciate the perspective priorities and insight that you have shared as a nerdy guy who reads and studies data I will need the guidance and Partnership of this committee I feel confident we can work together to make a difference I look forward to answering your questions and if confirmed sheering the president's bold energy agenda to unleash energy security and prosperity Mr chairman thank you for the opportunity to be here today I look forward to answering the committee's questions thank you very much Mr Wright well proceed to five minute rounds with Democrats and Republicans alternating in order of seniority and Order of arrival um and uh we'll begin those right now Mr Wright the Liberty Energy's bettering human lives report is something I've find an informative document I've got a copy of it right here uh it's something that brings what I regard as a pretty clear-headed perspective to the climate change dialogue which I I think has been sorely missing in our discussion of many of these issues uh as with anything that we do and basically everything that we build there are trade-offs in energy there are trade-offs in uh uh at the Nexus of of energy security energy poverty um economic Prosperity upward mobility and various environmental considerations the US Department of energy uh can play a a pivotal role but unfortunately during the Biden Administration um we've seen many levers within our system of government including and especially Department of energy being used as part of a quote unquote whole of government approach to reduce uh greenhouse gas emissions a and and doing this without considering the consequences of this kind of unbalanced approach uh the the uh the tradeoffs that I mentioned aren't really taken into a consideration it's one objective one objective taken into account as part of a whole of government approach that has really harmed a lot of American families so how in your view can and should the department of energy focus on energy abundance and how how will doing that help to restore the balance uh that American Energy policy has been lacking over the last four years thank you for the question Senator and for the points you made yes energy is hard but it is critical for our civilization and for the prosperity and security of our country uh the department of energy I I'll start with just the Magnificent 17 National Labs you know that this launched during World War II and we're a key part of actually America winning that war and securing a post-war peace um our Labs have been Pioneers in energy Innovation across the Spectrum very important for me is to keep the labs focused and energized to work on science basic fundamental science but also also science that will someday and maybe someday soon have applications to energy our Labs have a proud track record there and I and I want to Champion that and the labs and the energy Department as a whole works across the energy Spectrum with reasonable involvement in virtually every meaningful energy source we have today so my mission is to would be to inspire people in the department and in the labs and across the network to focus on what's most important for Americans which is growing the supply of affordable reliable secure American Energy growing the supply that that is a novel and very important concept to grasp especially at a moment when American Energy demand is growing growing because of our growing population also growing because of the ways in which we use energy uh with um data centers and artificial intelligence making a dent and about to make a much bigger dent in what it is that we need to uh energize our economy uh is a very poor time indeed to be declining um in terms of our energy production relative to anticipated demand it sounds like you grasp that uh fully and are ready to take that challenge on yes sir I I agree with you Senator very much in an an interim report that was released last month uh the department of energy Inspector General raised raised several pretty serious concerns regarding potential conflicts of interest within the uh Department of Energy's loan programs office those concerns include the troubling dual roles of some contractors who may be advising both the loan programs office and potential loan recipients at the same time the IG recommended uh that the issuance of new loans might be suspended should perhaps be suspended until these potential conflicts are fully addressed and the safeguards uh necessary to correct them are implemented if you're confirmed uh will you commit to uh to following the inspector General's recommendation and suspend the issuance of new loans until the loan programs office um compliance with conflicts of interest regulations and uh contractual obligations is guaranteed if I have the privilege to be confirmed I will immediately engage in that issue nothing is more important than the integrity of the loan process of following the rule of law with without Integrity without Fair processes you lose confidence you undermine business's ability to invest and where capital is deployed to I'm aware of the report and we'll dive into that issue immediately great my five minutes are expired we'll hear now from Senator Hinrich thank you uh chairman uh Mr W I'm going to start with a real easy one uh will you commit to visiting both CIA and Los Alamos National Labs in your first year if you're confirmed to secretary thank you Senator I I will absolutely commit to visit those two prestigious and hallowed institutions and I would coordinate love to coordinate with your staff and if if at all possible we could visit together but I'm a huge fan of those two institutions and uh look forward to walking their halls I I appreciate that very much um I would like you to talk a little bit uh about uh your divestment plans um you do and you've mentioned it a lot of work in the energy space um and we had a conversation about the need to maintain not only the avoidance of conflicts of interest uh but also the avoidance of appearances of conflicts of interest so can you talk a little bit about your plans for divestment I I agree with all of that Senator I've been a lifelong entrepreneur in the energy space um and of course I have submitted my disclosures of all of my work and the appropriate ethics counselors within the federal government have people yeah the appropriate ethics people have reviewed my investments my personal Holdings and other interests and I've agreed to take all the appropriate action to avoid any real conflicts or perceived conflicts of interest I'm fully aligned with you there Senator um I I appreciate your appreciated your comments uh about the Fidelity to the the rule of law and so I want to uh ask you a particular question in part because the OMB nominee uh has stated his support for using executive impoundment of funds passed by Congress in order to achieve spending reductions and so I've got a little bit of a two-part question for you um as secretary if the OM director was uh was to try to direct your department not to fund a program or an activity that Congress had expressly appropriated funding for would you follow the law thank you Senator yeah my my uh my mission the only way I roll would be to follow the laws and statutes of the of the United States of America um with respect to permitting uh this uh last Congress this committee actually Advanced a comprehensive all of the above permitting bill by a vote of 15 to4 um that that law was not signed into law because we have not reconciled it with the house but I want to ask you because included in that package were really important transmission reforms that would actually help us to meet the growing demand that we're seeing due to what's going on in artificial intelligence right now the increased electrification of our economy and an incredible bump in manufacturing that we've seen in the last couple of years so in your view how important is it that transmission line permitting reform be included as part of any broader permitting reform uh that we may be able to achieve thanks for that question Senator and thanks for also the wonderful dialogue we had in your office I appreciated that very much and I and I note we have lot of overlaps lots of common interests lots of common concerns and we've had roughly a 100e history in the United States of making electricity more affordable on inflation adjusted terms and our grid more reliable one of the engineering marvels of modern times and as we discussed we've seen that Trend reverse and in the last few years we've seen electricity prices go up and the reliability of the grid go down and and and both of us are very concerned conc erned about that particularly as we're as we're seeing future demand growth and I agree with you entirely that being able to build new transmission lines to be able to repower existing transmission lines and grow their capacity and many other things are very important to meet this growing demand of energy and hopefully return to a trend of a decline in the real cost of electricity and a growth in the reliability I'm aligned with you there uh I um I'm actually wearing uh my dad's ibw 60-year pin today because it reminds me of the importance of that grid um Doe's grid deployment office has supported a lot of really valuable projects uh through the transmission facilitation program including the Southline transmission project uh in my home state these projects will save customers money and they increase grid reliability um can you assure me at a time when um when Pro things like project 2025 have proposed just eliminating the grid deployment office that Doe will continue to use its authorities and its resources to support the kind of transmission projects that increase reliability and save customers money Senator thank you for your dad's uh service and building our grid and and maintaining it with it gorgeous track record all those years and yes I I I'm aligned with you and will seek to find the best ways to improve our transmission grid including expansion and new lines thank you Mr rght Senator Justice well thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr W Chris and thank you to all of his family I mean you being here is testimony to who you are and that's really good stuff now I wish you Happy Birthday and I'd like to tell everyone just a little bit about me you know I'm a new kid on the block that's for dadgum sure I'm not a politician I'm a business guy and I'm hung up on this I'm hung up on honor and truth and respect and reason and logic and you'll find that as we go forward with me now today I tell you just this I come from West Virginia and West Virginia truly knows energy that's all there is to it and I would just tell you this and I would promise you that this will be the case energy is everything everything if we think less than that we are thinking absolutely wrong at the end of the day every country of the world the more energy they have the healthier they are the longer they live energy is every single everything it's a key to inflation it's a key to our defense it's the dollars that fund the Russian war with Ukraine it is every single thing and absolutely we have to solve this we have to have a real energy strategy and we've got to solve this I've had many many conversations with with President Trump he absolutely believes exactly just this so Chris in this in these days ahead you will have a task beyond belief in my opinion with all that being said I know I know you will carry on that task in a great great way now listen from West Virginia you may think you know that all we can think about is one thing and one thing alone I would tell tell you just this we need to bra embrace all the energy forms but with that being said the moment in time when you absolutely believe that we can do without fossil fuels in this world today you're living in a cave you're absolutely living in a cave in my opinion we don't need to blow our legs off so China or India can dominate in so many different ways absolutely today we need to solve the whole Liv in a home burned down you ask any question I would just tell you just this I think that gentleman is misdirected in his thought but with all that being said I would always be respectful to that gentleman and that's how we all ought to be so with all with all all that being said I would say just this to Chris Chris are you in a position of thinking of embracing all the energy forms solving the whole riddle and I'll ask that question just in that way so please answer Senator thank you for your question and your impassion remarks uh we share a passion for energy and the reason I sit in front of you today is because president elect Trump shares a passion for energy and an instinctual understanding that energy is not a sector of the economy it's the sector of the economy that enables everything else we do when I met him he was just on fire about energy he got how it impacts American Quality of Life American economic strength our geopolitical power and what the possibilities are for the future how we can make our children and grandchildren's lives so much better than ours so I agree with you 100% energy is core it's Central we want energy from all sources we can that can add to our pile of affordable reliable secure American Energy well Chris that pleases me and uh and I would just say just this America has a big big crisis right in front of them if we don't solve this riddle in a year and a half from today we will have a crisis like you can't imagine with all that being said we're sitting we're sitting on a on the answer in America for America to be the footprint of the world and we got to do it Mr chairman I thank you so much for allowing me to speak and and Chris I am positive you're going to be confirmed and and God bless each and every one of you for being here in the family thank you so much thank you Senator thanks Senator Justice uh Senator Cortez Master thank you uh Mr chairman let me right off say U I do hope that the comedy of this committee continues into the next Congress um and I am disappointed that uh unfortunately right out of the gate we are creating controversy we nonexist and shouldn't exist here uh but I I am hopeful that the comedey continues um Mr Wright congratulations on your nomination thank you and thank you for your willingness to serve in this uh environment the way it is today I appreciate that welcome to your family and to your wonderful mother being here as well I appreciate that um let me ask you a couple questions that are important for Nevada we've talked about this uh in our meeting and I thank you for meeting with me but can Nadin can on you to acknowledge that the failed yucka Mountain project is unworkable uh as Senator thank you for that question and as we discussed I think if you're going to build large infrastructure and and and uh nuclear waste disposal would certainly fall in that category that has concerns you need to have on board the local community as well and uh and I think nevadans and as you've expressed clearly uh have deep concerns about seeing that facility go ahead and and I think that's your answer so president Trump has said he doesn't support uh waste at yucka Mountain so let me ask you again because you didn't really answer the question can Nadin count on you to acknowledge that the failed yucka Mountain project is unworkable I'm new to politics um you can see and you'll see all day long today I think that has been a clear record that Nevada and opposed the project uh I will work with uh with you and with Senators across the country to find solutions for long-term disposal of nuclear waste um and I agree with you that a a central part of that is going to be local buyin on the project uh what is your understanding of Doe's role in defense and National Security today oh it's it it is essential the the nnsa as a part of doe is the critical designer maintainer and Builder through contractors of our nation's nuclear Arsenal this is the ultimate guaran of our sovereignty I take that responsibility uh very seriously together with the coming instabilities in our electrical grid it is my single biggest concern uh in this job we have we have have lost our ability to enrich uranium in this country to construct plutonium pits and to do so many critical things that are key to our nuclear Arsenal I am highly motivated and and highly concerned that we need to make progress on the Safety and Security the stockpile of our nuclear weapons so the department of energy provides essential programs um and research across all corners of my state um its Critical Defense measures at the national um Security Site that you talked about our Workforce cyber security collaboration that we have with our universities uh and colleges in Nevada the public private Partnerships um to create new Innovative Technologies is actually happening in NADA thank to legislation that we have passed bipartisan legislation as well as the inflation reduction act um in the infrastructure law um let me ask you this would you push back on any attempts by the Trump Administration to cut any of these critical programs uh Senator I appreciate your passion for them it's too early for me to give any specifics about this program or that program but is cyber security critical for our country absolutely um is that let me let me be more specific because you talked about that when I asked you about the role of doe you you specifically talked about the National Security Site in Nevada would you push back on the Trump Administration if they attempted to cut any critical funding to the programs for the National Security Site I I will support to the extent I can all of our efforts in National security including those that are in Nevada let me ask you this you talked about in your um comments to some of my colleagues that you want to grow the supply of energy um Define for me the sources of energy you're talking about that you would like to grow all sources of affordable reliable which sources are they cure energy sure which sources it's different sources in different circumstances I mean our economy today is underpinned by energy dominantly from oil and natural natur gas coal is a major source of energy in our country n uh nuclear power is a major source of energy in our country hydr power is a major source of energy in our country wind and solar are growing rapidly and geothermal particularly in States like Nevada is early on but has just potential significant Running Room to become a meaningful source of energy in the future um and every source of energy that either today or with Technology Innovation can be a grow can be a growth engine for affordable reliable secure energy I'm for all of those good uh you did not mention solar solar is the number one energy for us in Nevada it's created jobs it's growing uh our economy and it has Major Impact so I'm disappointed that I didn't hear solar coming out as a part of the energy but I assume uh I'm not going to assume anything I'm just going to say the conversation we're going to have and continue to have around energy is important and it should be balanced and is not just focused on fossil fuels and no matter what some of my colleagues say uh there should be a balanced approach to it uh for our portfolio for energy and that's what I'm looking for always I agree entirely Senator and if I didn't say solar it was an oversight I worked in solar energy you have tremendous resources for that in Nevada and we're seeing a lot of growth in solar energy and I expect that to continue thank you Senator Cassidy hey Mr Wright um I really enjoyed the conversation we had in my office I like your empasis upon abundance I you know I I had a chance to scan your bettering human lives from Liberty Energy and I think you just nail it you're speaking about abundance both in terms of our natural resources but the abundance it means in terms of an increasing per capita GDP and we do it uh in a way that we lower emissions as we increase GDP and you look at a country like Germany and they have almost entered energy poverty in which they we have lowered our Emissions on a per capita basis more than they and our economy is growing grown more than they so I just want to I mean we're we're sympathic on this and I think frankly we should all be um now I'm also very interested because one thing that I mentioned in our conversation I've been very concerned about an offshoring of carbon emissions to countries like China but as we offshore we offshore the job and that Prosperity we're trying to build for working Americans we lose to a working Chinese now they don't enforce their environmental regulations so their socks not and whatever blows over on us when we're trying to do it right and they use it for competitive Advantage all that to lead into um and by the way you allude to that you talk about how Great Britain has actually offshored their carbon intensity and then they reshored through the products they buy so it's an artificial depression and their carbon intensity I mean I I I I think you bring a sophistication to this argument this discussion which is just like like just we just need now one thing I've been um supporting is something called a f pollution fee in which we look at the emissions profile of a US you name it concrete uh and then you compare it to aluminum let's say aluminum aluminum and we compare it to a competitor like China which does not enforce emissions and we put a fee roughly equal to their avoided cost of not complying with internationally acceptable emission profile any thoughts on that because it seems very consistent with the problems you point out in the um bettering human lives from Liberty Energy thank you for that question Senator and thank you for the great dialogue we had about all these issues about energy about bettering lives about Trade Practices about prosperity for Americans um I think yourself and I and president-elect Trump are very aligned on all of those and I think you have a creative idea about how do we address some of these asymmetries that have developed um if if you look at the data of economic growth in the United States versus manufacturing growth in the United States in economic output they roughly track for a century and right after the year 2000 when China has admitted to the World Trade Organization they diverge dramatically with ours going down for the manufacturing and China's manufacturing going up but also their emission profile exploding at the same time 100% And as you said look the United Kingdom and Germany and other of our European allies LED with us and they've gone even further on I think this destructive habit of just moving their energy intensive manufacturing out of their country and then count so I'm taking that that as a yes you'll support my foreign pollution fee but anyway um let me ask you because one critical role of doe is to help calculate the embedded emissions now some fear that thinking it's going to be some regulatory Crackdown I see it as a way to competitively to outcompete others because if theirs is here and ours is there and we know that from this calculation then that helps our domestic manufacturers uh because there'll be a higher fee placed upon the product coming from overseas do you follow how I'm saying that uh yes I'm following you senator now so doe has a pilot project currently calculating embedded emissions um would would you commit to continuing to support that program again if I have the privilege to be confirmed I will look into all of these efforts it sounds like I'm 18 years old and I want a future we will have order restored there will be no additional Outburst the officers will remove this individual from the room and we will continue with the hearing of the ask that the testimony be delayed until the room is cleared please proceed Mr Wright may I suggest that the people who are protesting look at your at your monograph on building a human life because it shows that us emissions have come down in absolute amounts per capita amounts every way you want to measure it since 2000 since 1990 we are doing the job LED in part by you know the things that you and I have talked about in our meeting um so going back to um um you also will be negotiating International Energy Partnerships through the office of international Affairs and you spoke about Global Leadership as well wasn't in your written remarks but it was in your spoken testimony you want to elaborate on that please yes as we discussed en energy is the enabler of everything we do but America going from 20 years ago the largest importer of oil in the world and the largest importer of natural gas in the world to today the largest exporter of natural gas in the world enormous growth in our geopolitical leverage we were able to fill most of the Gap when Russia invaded Ukraine and and Russian gas Imports into Europe were reduced most of the replacement gas came from in the United States we couldn't have done that 20 years ago thank you Mr chair and I'll just say we began the conference the 5 minutes to talk about abundance for the American people now we talk about our abundance helping our helping our allies we're all about abundance thank you Mr Wright thank you Senator thank you Senator Cassie Senator Hickenlooper thank you Mr chair uh and thank you Mr Wright for being here um as we consider our Energy Future uh we have so many challenges to to deal with uh uh Energy prices energy poverty as you you've written about um obviously climate change is such a a big one uh as secretary do you think there's a the possibility that department of energy could finally begin to build a plan a comprehensive plan on how we deal with the energy future but also uh really look take a a hard look at climate change Senator yes indeed I'm very interested in that idea and it's certainly something I've been thinking about the the department of energy created a look into energy and what the future of energy might bring about 20 years ago um I think it's time to do that again and to look not just at energy and the energy trajectory we're on but the other issues related to energy and top among those climate change and I think just on that on that note uh and you have you have in the past some time ago uh but but described the how slowly climate change is evolving and it's so far out in the future it probably shouldn't command as much attention and yet I continue and I think a lot of people concerned about the the acceleration and and how soon can we recognize those feedback loops we're talking about the salinity of the oceans the the massive ice melts and and cing of glaciers those those things have the potential to create a much more rapid uh rate of change and I think that's part of ability to get a planet as of 2024 they're saying we're at about 1.5 degrees uh Celsius uh in increased temperature uh if it goes much faster than that you think we should have some contingency plans like ready so that we can address that that that scenario even now we look at the again the fires in in in Los Angeles uh some of the Hurricanes these extreme weather events and we're obviously not prepared for them we don't have an insurance system that works you know each of those suggest or command that we should have a backup systems in place now AB absolutely Senator uh as as you know i' I've studied and followed the data and the evolution of climate change for at least 20 years now it is a global issue it is a real issue it's it's a challenging issue and the solution to climate change is to evolve our Energy System I've worked on that most all of my career again in nuclear and solar and geothermal and new battery storage technology now um and do I wish we could make faster progress absolutely are there things we can do Investments together through the department of energy to accelerate development of new Energy Technologies that are really the only Pathway to address climate change absolutely um and we should have nothing but American leadership in this area energy and climate is a global problem but America should be the leader and I think president Trump is firmly aligned with that position as well great uh on a more parochial note obviously the renewable energy laboratory in uh a large portion of that work has done in Colorado you feel uh that those budgets are are uh properly spent or do you think they should be re-evaluated it's it's too early for me to comment on something like that um I visited the national renewable energy laboratory years ago as a fellow energy guy in Denver a lot of great work there a lot of great humans there that are driving Innovation and that are working with businesses too it's not just basic research in the lab it's it's very focused on applied research and new technologies so I'm very keen to engage in a more detailed level with what's being on there and and and how to drive that further and faster you know this I think it's going to be the first time I've ever gotten five questions in with a with a testimony so not sure what that says uh we spent a lot of work looking at the grid and as we do begin to build infrastructure that can respond if if we need to make more dramatic changes to our Energy System uh whether it's climate change or whatever other constraints may come along um we've really been styed both in terms of the permitting process and finding ways that we can make sure that we protect local communities make sure that their voice is heard make sure that we uh respect the environmental uh importance of of of our Landscapes but at the same time realize we've got to move more rapidly in in building things like electrical infrastructure can you talk a little bit towards electrical infrastructure yes Senator I I think you've hit in the energy world the most pressing problem we have is our electricity grid and this problem is is uh only going to get worse I'm very concerned about that we need to change the gear we've been in the last several years and we need to get serious about building infrastructure and investment bringing the cost of electricity prices back down and keeping our grid stable I'm deeply concerned about our current trajectory no I appreciate that thank you I yield back to the chair thank you Senator hick Senator hey Smith thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr wght and this lovely family that you have behind you I certainly enjoyed our visit in my office when we had the opportunity to discuss the uh importance of this committee the importance of what you will be doing and your leadership you know everybody in here sitting up here we have economic developers come to our state and we certainly want Economic Development we want good jobs for our citizens and so much of that is a part of what kind of energy can we provide for that company so uh thank you for discussing those things with me because they're certainly important to my people in Mississippi as well as other states the uh Department of energy themselves they classify nuclear energy as the largest source of clean power in the United States and containment as we well know is critical to every aspect of nuclear energy high efficiency particulate air filters um you know what we refer to is the Heap of filters are the operational barrier between the containment and the release of radioactive particles so I'm proud in my home state of um at Mississippi State University where my daughter's in graduate school there but not in this area they have been for a long time researching new technologies in order to develop better performances and the capabilities of these Hipp filters for new reactors containment uh ventilation and uh This research really plays an important role in advancing the Next Generation filtration systems that we're all concerned with because we're certainly concerned about the future of the policies that we're passing now for Miles when he's an adult of how the things we're talking about today that will affect him and uh what do you see is the deficiencies related to containment ventilation issues for Waste processing and new generations of power reactors so thank you senator for the question and thank you for our fabulous dialogue and for what you do of for the great state of Mississippi um you you kept hitting on technology and Technology at Mississippi State Technology really is the key for growing our Energy Future for both growing more abundance to Better Lives is here La is burning it is because of fossil fuel companies and Big Oil billionair people are the committee will stand in recess until the Capitol Police can restore order in the committee committee will be in order committee will be in order committee will be in order committee will stand in recess until the capitol policeman can restore order the committee will stand in recess until the US capital police can restore order committee will stand in recess until the Capitol Police can restore order thank you I think we figured out it's every other speaker here so just heads up but I I drew out a lot of them so I'm sorry about that um no but and you were talking specifically about advancements in nuclear technology how do we get it's already a significant source of energy in the United States but it hasn't grown in decades how do we get it growing again how does that research in Mississippi on air filtration and on Research so many other places how do we get it going again and my uh my view on that is building large project projects in this country we're seeing that with transmission lines and so many other things very hard to do we need to fix that problem you know typical nuclear reactor is a gwatt it's a th000 megawatts the last ones we built took well over a decade and multiples over cost budget fortunately with nuclear we have a new generation of reactors that are smaller and they'll be more manufactured in a facility anything that's manufactured in a facility think a semi conductor or a bike or something the cost of those are coming down anything that's that's built on location the cost of those have been going up so we've got to figure out how to get some of these cost barriers out of the way we've got to get better Technologies like like they're working on at Mississippi State to get Americans comfortable with the safety of nuclear with the security of nuclear but I think the the facts and the Technologies today are pretty compelling nuclear today is a little less than 20% of us electricity that's pretty significant but we also have to remember electricity is just one sliver of energy the biggest use of energy is high temperature process heat and I would say it's the most important use of energy because it's how we make steel and cement and metals and all those things that we make everything else out it we can't build an internet or a car or a factory without those materials nuclear could provide energy could provide high temperature heat to really impact manufacturing as well there's just so much room to run and to grow for nuclear energy and I think we're going to see a broad Investments across our country in the research and the enabling Technologies and hopefully before long we're going to see the energy source deployed widely as well it is so refreshing to hear you say those things and I so look forward to working with you you and uh the things that U all the questions have been so good today but it really gives us hope and optimism thank you for your willingness to serve and I'm out of time thank you Senator Senator hono you're up next thank you Mr chairman uh before I get to my questions I just want to note that we did not receive information relating to this nominee until really late yesterday and it would have been um good if we could have followed the uh process that would have given us more time which meant that this hearing would not be happening today so uh for the nominee as part of my responsibilities as a member of this as well as all my other committees I asked the following two initial questions to ascertain the fitness of the nominee for the job so I ask you since you became a legal adult have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature I have not have you ever faced disciplin or entered into a settlement relating to this kind of conduct I have not it is shocking to see the devastation uh that is caused by the wildfires in Los Angeles and of course we are seeing that um you it's shocking in 2023 a wildfire killed 102 people and destroyed the town of L Al Maui and Hawaiian electri which is our major utility company received a 95 million award from the doe to help in rebuilding Maui's electric Guild uh grid and reduce the risk of future wildfires um the the state of Hawaii has also received other support and funding from the doe to proceed with this kind of modernization do you acknowledge the need for improvements to our electric grids that will reduce the risk of wildfires and ensure reliable access to power Senator thank you for your question and boy I remember watching with horror the fires on Laina and the fires today in La it is absolute human tragedy it is devastating but but do you answer your question absolutely yes we need to improve our electric grid both for increased supply for increased residence to to Natural dis as we see these kinds of natural disasters I think states are municipalities will need help from the doe so will you continue allocating funding for grid improvements as authorized by Congress yes or no well I'm not sure it's quite as simple as that but I think that my short answer would be yes of course I want to work with you and other states who increase grid residence I appreciate that uh the doe is required to ensure that all construction and repair projects funded by the doe under the infrastructure investment and jobs act pay prevailing prevailing wages will you pay prevailing wages as re required under the infrastructure law that I just mentioned Senator if I have the privilege to be confirmed I will follow the laws and statutes of the United States and that would mean paying prevailing wages on these kinds of projects U The Washington Post reported that in April 2024 Donald Trump told a group of about 24 oil Executives at Mar Lago that they should raise $1 billion for his campaign which would be a deal given his commitment to reversing environmental regulations expanding oil and gas leasing on Federal Land and approval of natural gas exports did you attend that meeting at Mar Lago I was at a dinner with President Trump in Mar Lago in April quite a bit different than what you just described but yes I was a dinner well it it was reported that he talked about a $1 billion so do do you think uh that it was appropriate for the president to even put forth the possibility of such a deal I was at the dinner and the president put forward no such deal that's not what was reported uh as Secretary of Energy you will have oversight over a lot of contracts grants and Loan guarantees are you prepared to engage in vigorous oversight of the Doe's funding even if president Trump pressures you to approve sweetheart deals to one of his favorite businesses will you be objective and uh should you be confirmed I have followed rigorous and ethical B business practices my whole life Senator and will continue to do exactly that at the department of energy if I have the privilege of being confirmed I only have a little bit of time but I do I do want to get to this if you are confirmed your obligation will be to the American people not to the shareholders or board members for an oil gas company would you allow all exports of natural gas to China and anywhere else around the world regardless of whether the exports would increase Heating and power bills for the American people um Senator I'd love to have more time to talk about natural gas exports the brief history of them is as we've grown our natur gas exports our price of natural gas has gone down because the the industry natural gas production industry has benefited you're telling me that you would I I'm I'm asking whether you would take into consideration what the impact for uh the cost of energy in America would be if you allow export of of these oil and gas so would you you you would keep that uppermost in mind right with what the impact of of these kinds of exports would be to the cost of energy to our American people absolutely Senator I share your concern there Senator hovind thank you Mr chair uh Chris uh as you've talked about deploying the latest greatest Technologies is how we produce more energy more cost effectively more dependably with the best environmental stewardship not only here at home but when we Implement those Technologies the world follows so that's actually the global solution how do we actually bring folks Along on that where they're skeptical like in fossil fuels if they're skeptical of fossil fuels and so forth how do we demonstrate to them that that technology where we lead and we have the best environmental stewardship actually benefits globally how do we convince them what what can you do um Senator thank you for the question thank you for your opening remarks as well this this is tough i' I've spent my whole adult life engaged in dialogues about energy um when I went to MIT to work on Fusion Energy I worked on solar energy at UC Berkeley my whole thing is we want more energy in the world because it's what makes people's lives better um and you and you have to understand that there isn't dirty energy and clean energy all energies are different and they all have different trade-offs different people have different weights or valuations of trade-offs different geographies or locations have have climates more favorable to this energy versus that energy so it's a complicated dialogue which means it's it's not easy to get people to share this broader perspective on it I I think we're seeing a little bit of that in passioned well-meaning wonderful people that have been sitting in the hearing room today but one of the one of the things I've worked on is to try to just assemble the numbers and the data and when I when I was born the world got kind of a mid 80% of its total energy from hydrocarbons and I was born as we know pretty much very close to 60 years ago 60 years ago in a few hours right now um but today total Global primary energy is sort of low to mid 80% so Global demand for Energy's grown a lot we brought a lot of new Energy Technologies along thankfully or we wouldn't have as much energy as we have today but it's proven very hard to displace Hydro carbons in the global Energy System and I'll say one last thing Senator and turn it back to you the other perspective I think that's important to look at is one billion people live lives like us we get to wear fancy clothes made out of hydrocarbons we get to use motorized transport and travel to visit our family and we have warm houses in the winter and we have cool cool houses in the summertime but that's 1 billion people in the world There's 7 billion people in the world that don't live lives anything like we do and I've traveled to 55 countries and one thing I know those 7 billion people they want this they want what we have um and of course they should get what we have and through Market forces in Improvement and Leadership particularly leadership from the president-elect Trump I think we're going to see growing more abundant energy resource coming out of out of our country and hopefully out of the world so that every everyone else can live lives like we do and I think it's really important that that you are a voice for that uh because you you'll have a platform to convince people and to explain what you just explained here all different types of energies have strengths and weaknesses but when we deploy these Technologies we lead the way more energy higher standard of living and better environmental stewardship and that's really what you're all about rather than folks trying to say well we can't have this and we got to only have that and so that's a big role for you to play and following on that you worked on hydraulic fracturing and so forth it was technically feasible but it wasn't economically feasible right same thing with other things like as the president's talked about Clean Coal technology we've addressed socks KNX Mercury and now CO2 will you commit to working with us to address the carbon capture the CO2 capture not only to address CO2 concerns but also to use it as a resource for additional oil recovery our state's leading in that area you know that I want you to touch on that and then uh respond to whether you will come with me to the University of North Dakota the energy and environmental uh research uh uh uh commission there uh and see what we're doing and work with us on things like project Tundra to do this thank you Senator all in 10 seconds I'm sorry my answer is a resounding yes great that's fine thank you Senator pil thank you Mr chair uh look folks we've all seen the uh Devastation in Los Angeles due to the ongoing wildfires that have burned more than 40,000 acres of land this last week and have destroyed more than 12,000 structures and have has led to more than two dozen lives being lost uh the fires are now the most destructive natural disasters in Los Angeles history and despite the misinformation that's circulating here in the capitl in Southern California and everywhere in between it's clear that these fires only reach the size and the scale that they have because of unseasonably dry vegetation and extremely high winds both of which are a direct result of climate change Mr Wright thank you for being here but as you've seen the last week the climate crisis and its deadly effects is very real to my neighbors and my constituents as we discussed in our meeting yesterday uh you were a longtime resident of California so you've seen the conditions evolve uh firsthand so I got to tell I was pretty disappointed to come across some social media posts of yours and I'll will quote understand you've written that the hype over wildfires is just hype to justify more impoverishment from Bad government policies end quote given the devastation that we're currently experiencing in Los Angeles do you still believe that wildfires are just hype uh sir it it is with great sorrow and and and fear that I watch what's happening in your city of La and think it's just hype or not climate change is a real and Global phenomenon is it hype or not I stand by my past comment so you believe it's hype you know climate change is a real tell that to the families of the more than two dozen lost in these fires and Counting because the urban search and rescue teams are still going property by property with cadaver dogs that number is going to climb I'm disappointed Mr rght um let me make reference to another uh element of your social media you reposted a statement so not your words but you felt it important enough to amplify a social media post and I'll quote now obviously burning to death in a fire is a pretty Grim but that is not what is happening like the climate zealots would like you to believe end quote so again to the families of more than a couple dozen of my constituents who have died in these fires and that number is growing like I mentioned do you believe that californ who have died over the past week are somehow just a figment of our imagination of course not Senator it it is it is heart-wrenching to watch the destruction most importantly lives I Ag and I'm not sorry for cutting you off here I think that the point has been made and you're standing by your posts and I assume the reposts as well and I'll tell you why I'm further disappointed we had I think a a genuine conversation yesterday in my office you said you're you're a science you have a science background you pride yourself in uh leaning on facts and truth and evidence and data uh as you make decisions and decide which actions to take to let me actually transition to something that's very substantive in this role should you be fortunate enough to be confirmed one of the most important functions of the Department of energy is research we've discussed the uh uh 17 National Labs and you referenced it earlier in your testimony that are working hard to tackle critical scientific challenges California is home to three of these labs and we understand the need for these labs to advance our research and our knowledge the data and research published by these labs and the department written large are foundational for unlocking new technologies and maintaining our competitive advantages globally will you commit to publishing and not censoring non-classified Department of Energy Research absolutely Senator the scientific process has been a key driver of our progress of our country and of our world and let me tell you why I feel the need to even ask the question it should be a no-brainer because it is a very real possibility that you may be asked by incoming president Trump maybe through one of his intermediaries to not publish or to withhold or otherwise suppress doe research and studies what would you do if asked I'm very proud to be serving I hope if I have the privilege to be confirmed with incoming president Trump he is my passion for energy and for bettering American lives um I'm if asked what would you do I will follow the scientific method I will be honest in integrity and follow the laws and statutes of our country of course I will Senator the one other question my very little time uh remaining uh and I'll just sort of cut to the chase in my office you uh May me shared with me uh your opinion that uh Federal subsidies do not make sense for mature Industries correct less fruitful there yes and you included oil and gas in the examples of mature Industries correct correct so please share with me with my colleagues on this committee um expand on your belief that if oil and gas are truly mature Industries and subsidies don't make sense here anymore and we should retract those subsidies and maybe redirect those into smarter more uh uh contemporary Investments yeah as a career entrepreneur a a free market uh Advocate my goal is to have the a small role for government in business particularly in mature businesses just as I discussed you have to have the rule of law you have to have the the enforcement of contracts but the best role for the federal government is basic research and helping launch new technologies that are just getting their footing so I take that as a supportive position of rolling back subsidies for oil and gas thank you very much uh thank you very much um we we are in the presence of greatness as we have Senator R who's the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee he's got another cabinet nominee uh with Senator Rubio in front of his committee we're gonna Senator baraso was graciously agreed to allow Senator R to take the first couple minutes of his time and uh so we'll go hear from Senator R and then immediately thereafter Senator baraso thank you very much and thank you Mr chairman and uh and also senator braso for your Indulgence here I do have to get back um Mr I first of all thank you for taking the time to meet with me and uh I I'm came here today because I want to give you an opportunity to underscore your understanding the importance of nuclear energy as you know Idaho is the birthplace of nuclear energy in the universe uh we still have the first light bulbs that were lit with nuclear energy there at the idol National Lab um and as I explained to you uh the Ido National Lab is a incredibly important uh Cog in the wheel of nuclear energy and uh appreciate your commitment to visit there and uh we'll we we will look forward to that as I explained to you um with the Renaissance of nuclear energy not only in the in America but even louder really in the in the world r large um we compete we the United States of America compete with Russia China and France in in providing being the Prov uh of uh uh nuclear power plants uh to other countries who are interested and there is so much interest right now U and as I explained to you the the importance of us when a contract is put out from another country the importance of us being the winner in that because it creates a 100-year relationship uh uh as we go forward with nuclear energy uh could you uh take a minute to articulate your understanding of the import import uh that we the United States of America and particularly the Ido National Lab uh the importance they have in leading the world as we go forward over the next decades and through this Century on converting over to nuclear energy thank you Senator and I very much enjoyed our visit a lot to be proud of in Idaho particularly Idaho National Lab but the United States invented the technology of nuclear first for for abrupt action weapons and then for commercial nuclear power of course we should lead in that the president Trump president-elect trump and I are entirely aligned on this but you're right there's other players out there in the space and if the US moves slowly other players are going to fill that vacuum much better if that technology that Alliance that partnership is with the United States I'm firmly in favor of that nuclear is probably a smaller today energy source only 4% of global energy that could grow huge um it's had that potential for some time and I'd like to see it move faster as soon as we can that's I I appreciate that and I I agree with you it not only can move faster it will move faster the Advent of the small modular reactor the SMR and the Advent of the micro which is going to be behind it U fairly quickly uh we are moving uh quick uh China is competing with us as far as who can get these online quick enough who can get them demonstrated quick enough who can get the first commercial up and running when that happens there's going to be a stampede by countries to sign up to get smrs and micros and uh and I I after talking with you I'm convinced that uh that you agree that we need to be a leader the leader uh in doing that so thank you for your understanding in that regard and uh look forward to working with you uh on that thank you Mr chairman Senator Brum uh thanks so much and first I want to congratulate you Senator Lee on being chairman of the committee through your first hearing at the helm and we're very grateful for your thoughtful leadership on these important hearings we're getting underway and tomorrow we have North Dakota governor uh bergham who's here to testify as a nominee and I I assume we're going to hear another wonderful introduction by the go the great Senator former governor of North Dakota absolutely great thank you U Mr Right congratulations we've had a chance to visit I have a number of questions but before and I'm going to submit most of them for writing uh there were some questions from the senior senator from California about why fires and you abruptly cut off from trying to answer and he apologized for cutting you off but I would want to give you time to Now respond if you'd like to for some of the comments that he had made that you weren't able to respond to oh as as someone who has spent my life focused on poverty and poverty abatement in our country and abroad seeing people suffering seeing people in pain seeing people lose family members lose their property lose their sense of self lose their security is absolutely heart-wrenching um it's horrible to watch what's happening in LA today um and wow that's this is these are the kind of things we want to protect people from we want to make our society more resilient stronger um there's there's no words to say in the middle of a personal drama trauma you know that that that reflect Global policy and all that these are human tragedies that touch every one of us I lived in California for 19 years have lots of friends in the LA area I probably get emotional talking about it it's horrific to see what's happening there we need to do everything we can to get those fires out to get that infrastructure rebuilt and to get people to return to the lives they had before it was visited on by these horrific fires I I agree it's heartbreaking and I know we have our Wyoming National Guard there with equipment as well as Manpower and trying to do that I Senator Cortez Mesto made a made a point about um actually was your answer to Senator Cortez Mesto mentioned that we've lost the capacity to enrich uranium and America is dependent on Imports right now to to fuel our nuclear reactors we have extremely limited commercial uh enrichment and conversion capacity not in America's best interest in 2023 Congress passed the nuclear fuel Security Act uh we uh repurposed $2.7 billion in funding to support this goal if confirmed will you make it a priority to build and secure our nuclear fuel supply chain Senator absolutely I know we shared that uh concern in our dialogue in your office it is a significant hole in the US Arsenal right now a technology we developed but yet we import most of it from abroad and most that's enriched in the US is by companies that are not American companies in the US yes we need to build American nuclear infrastructure on mining on enrichment on power production and on waste disposal which is a tough challenge Congress passed legislation to ban Imports of Russian uranium in the United States this law is intended to revive American uranium production strengthen our nuclear fuel supply uh it has to be implemented correctly the Secretary of Energy has the discretion to provide wavers to companies seeking to import uranium from Russia do you agree these waivers should be very limited and used only in extreme circumstances uh Senator I I I would agree with that assessment it is very sad how dependent we have become come on imported enrich uranium from Russia that is a sad State of Affairs where we are today we need to get beyond that but we need to get beyond that without shutting down the nuclear power plants we have running today um so it is an it is an area that requires urgent action because it does seem that as the shut down Russian uranium now we see more imports from China uh so the the next issue is confirm will you support efforts to end uranium imports from China as we continue to try to build the US nucle nuclear Supply yes Senator that that that is another C another country on which we should not be dependent upon for critical supplies and of course enrich uranium to turn on our lights and power our factories are critical supplies and then finally with to Advanced nuclear reactor and demonstration projects uh Department of Energy's Advanced reactor demonstration program is meant to help developers overcome some of the hurdles that we have in terms of the expense early on with the development programs receive Broad byart partisan support from this committee and across the Congress so I look forward to getting the current projects over the Finish Line will you ensure the department continues to be a faithful partner in this Mission yes Senator I think that is a key role of the US government and particularly of the Department of the energy to help bridge these technologies that have lots of Running Room but for mostly for government regulatory burden and uncertainty have not been able to reach full commercial status yet thank you thank you Mr chairman thank you very much um we're now going to turn to another new member of the committee our our new colleague representing the state where I was born and it turns out a fellow fan of marashi Music gracias thank you chairman uh thank you Mr R for your attendance here today and thank you as well for meeting with me yesterday for a productive discussion about the energy future of Arizona so I'd like to follow up and expand on a couple areas that we discuss and and have been discussed here so number one I really do appreciate your enthusiasm for nuclear energy and in my time in Congress I've supported annual Appropriations for small modular reactors we've heard a couple times about them here in smrs and I do see great potential in them as a safe renewable energy source however smrs and nuclear energy more broadly face several challenges including the cost of scaling commercialization public perception and permitting as Energy Secretary what actions will you take to improve the development and deployment of smrs uh if I thank you senator for the question thank you for our great dialogue recently and and uh congratulations also to be a new senator in this August body um it's a big Challenge and I'm new to government so I I can't list off the five levers I can pull but I will I certainly been in dialogues and investigations about how do we how do we make it how do we make it easier to research to invest to build things I think doe has land in facilities that can be helpful in this regard my current company Liberty energy owns part of a small modular reactor company called OKO and their first small modular reactor is going to be built in the Idaho National Lab a doe facility um so is there enabling role doe can play to help launch nuclear energy I think absolutely I think it's both creative things like that it's also research it's also communication about the energy and the technology look this should be a huge part of America's future energy source but that won't happen without action within the legislature of the United States uh with action from the Department of energy and our and our incoming Administration okay and assume that this is where we'd have some communication from your ledge staff to us what kind of legislation could we also be passing here to help you know really scale up uh smrs and other types of nuclear uh energy to help you cut through the regulations too absolutely the advaned act that was passed not long ago I think is early on and I think it's a great first step so step some steps have been taken but certainly more can be done excellent so Arizona is actually is a state with ample renewable resources sun and rapidly growing industrial sector since the passage of the IRA Arizon has seen billions of dollars in new clean energy Investments and created tens of thousands of really good paying jobs in some of our rural areas too some Republicans uh have started talking about dismantling and narrowing the energy Provisions from the IRA uh which in the end would not actually save money and doing so would actually cost Arizona middle class jobs economic growth and also clean energy production which I think we all agree we want as much energy production above you know no matter what where it comes from will you commit to protecting clean energy production provisions of the IRA and how will your department of how will the department of energy ensure that previously authorized IRA funds are efficiently distributed thank you for the the question senator look it's I'm not involved in lawmaking that that'll be here in the body of the Senate and the house my goal would be to implement the laws of the land and maybe make some decisions on allocation of capital or funds that are approved by Congressional bodies and I will seek to allocate those funds in the most en in the most efficient way to grow our supply of affordable reliable secure energy and to invest in technologies that can't do that today but have a clear Pathway to do that in the future that I think is a critical function of the doe from basic research to emerging Technologies to technologies that have been born but are not at commercial scale yet I think there's a a critical role from the doe and all of those things and now moving on from generation now to transmission uh because doesn't really make a difference if you generate C move it right uh so I do believe that more transmission construction will also be vital to meeting the energy demands in the coming years all over the country and I voted repeatedly to streamline the permitting for transmission energy projects what will be your approach be to improving the timeline for transmission project approvals oh I've been a a passionate advocate for making as I said in my opening statement to make it easier to build things in America it'll always be hard it involves communities and space and movement of materials but we need to be able to build things in America you can't build the Next Generation system if you can't build anything I think uh president Trump campaigned aggressively on building things again in America on growing American energy production on securing our electricity grid and driving down the price the only way you can drive down the price of a critical commodity is to grow this Supply so there's going to be many different Avenues to pursue there and as a political novice I'm going to be learning along the way and learning from all the members of this Committee in the most effective ways to do that but I am 100% committed to Growing our electricity grid and our energy production and removing those barriers that are standing in the way of doing things in Arizona and across our country great look forward to working with you thank you Mr chairman thank you Senator we'll turn now to our former chairman Senator marowski thank you Mr chairman and it's nice to be able to call you that um I think one of the benefits that you will will see as being chairman is you get to listen to the testimony from beginning to end and I will tell you that uh your testimony this morning Mr Wright is so encouraging I love the fact that you are a self-described energy geek I love the fact that uh our colleague Senator Hickenlooper uh in his introduction calls you a scientist who's invested his life around energy to have somebody before the committee who understands energy from the scientific perspective from the entrepreneurial perspective from the economic perspective to the security perspective is truly extraordinarily unique and so the fact that you have been nominated to this position and you have have agreed to go through this process thank you for that um you bring to the table uh I think just the type of enthusiasm and quite honestly the ability to communicate why energy is so key in our office we talked about the fact that we have those to view energy somehow as a liability we view it as an asset we agree on that but your focus about affordability and abundance is so important to understand so there's been a lot of passion that you've heard in the back of the room today and you've had your back to it but your ears and I think your heart is attuned to it because there is so much emotion that is attached to what we're seeing with the changes in our climate today and we can argue about uh the the percentages or how much is human CA or whatever but we are seeing that undeniably there is change you are not denying that you have said before this committee and in other places that climate change is real is that correct absolutely Senator and I heard you say uh this morning and make sure I wrote this down correctly that the solution to climate change is is how we evolve our Energy System is that a correct summation absolutely Senator so it's about technology we're acknowledging we're dealing with it we're living it we're feeling it we're feeling it in Alaska right now I wish that I could tell you it was as cold as in Alaska right now as it is in Washington DC this morning but we're seeing changes that are detrimental to our system our thermostat is out of whack and we want to have the Arctic temperatures up North but one of the ways that we know we're going to get there is through our our technologies that will help us adapt mitigate and and and to really help prevent so I want to direct a couple of my uh comments this morning more to the perial side um when we're talking about arctic we don't necessarily have the National Labs although we do have a great partnership with enr um with our cold climate housing we're very very proud about that but where do you think the Arctic energy office the office of Indian energy and enals Alaska campus fit into your thinking when you're thinking about not only the Technologies but how you can how you can use a place like Alaska as a proven ground for so many of these Technologies where our energy costs are higher than just about any other place in the United States of America and arguably in parts of the world Senator thanks for the question and thanks for the fabulous dialogue we had in your office that was so broad ranging and and and as I think we discussed there I view Alaska as a microcosm for the world now it's hard to call Alaska micro but here here you are a state with just enormous energy resources set right next door to remote communities with very little energy access and the energy access they do have is expensive you know this is the combination of resources lack of infrastructure different settings need different energy sources um I have worked uh for years in this area and in fact sitting behind me is the gal who runs our bettering human life Foundation trying to bring energy access to remote villages in Africa so I when I hear of your Arctic energy office and the communities you're trying to serve this is the global problem how do we get different Energy solutions for different communities at different stage of economic development at different uh different Lifestyles different cultures and uh I would my my vision if I am get the honor to be confirmed maybe is to expand on that Arctic Energy Office to this isn't this is an energy office for remote communities for different communities there's different Technologies and different answers there than for industrial energy for manufacturing steel not going to do that in a small Alaskan Village it's appro it's appreciating the diversity of where we all are as well as the diversity of resources I want to ask one quick question even though I'm I'm at the edge of my time here because nobody has really spoken to critical minerals this morning and I view this as this next looming ener next looming security vulnerability if we want to move out with these Energy Technologies regardless of where they are we're going to need these minerals and we recognize that and I think we recognize that we are stronger when we are developing more of that here at home I shared with you in our meeting in December how frustrated I I was with the Department of energy over its repeated subsidization of of a graphite processing plant that was getting its supply of graphite from mosm Beek um we have a a natural graphite deposit up in Alaska outside of gome the same day that uh that we met the company behind that project that was importing graphite from mosm Beek was forced to declare Force meure why because of the violent unrest in mosm and and so now we've got millions of of US taxpayer dollars that are at risk and so it's it's something that I hope you will look at very critically in terms of what we are doing to ensure that we are responsibly accessing our resources here particularly in the critical minerals vein but but making sure that we're not we're not embarking on on uh exercises that are going to to result in a loss of taxpayer dollars without any net benefit to to the people here in this country I'm over my time but I am really excited about the potential that you will bring to the energy discussion in this country thank you Mr chairman thank you Senator thanks Senator mccy we'll go next to Senator kwell thank you Mr chairman and before I begin my questioning I just want to comment on you know I've been on this committee since uh working with chairman marow I mean Frank marowski which means I've served with a lot of a lot of chairmen and a lot of different committees uh this committee has debated and argued over a lot of issues but paperwork has never been one of them so I just hope that everybody will take a deep breath and understand that transparency in the process here is all that people want and I think I know that people are anxious in the new Administration to get their people we want them to have that opportunity but um um the transparency that it takes to just get the paperwork and have time for people to digest it is important and I think everything will go smoother if we if we can get that done um Mr Wright congratulations on your nomination and I add my colleagues who've said um thanks for your willingness to serve I have to start with handford cleanup I think you could go back to my record on every Energy Secretary and that's where we would always start I mean we played a very important role for our nation during World War II we're very proud of that but the cleanup after the Manhattan Project also has to be historic and committed to over a long period of time um I've have definitely voted for Republicans to be Energy Secretary but they've also committed to cleaning up Hanford and I want to ask you about your same commitment we as a a state and the and the department of energy entered into a tri party agreement that has been updated recently into a final uh agreement will you commit to upholding the commitment that Doe has made to the time frame and cleanup of handford waste and usually what happens is energy secretaries or actually that's not true o andb people come in and say oh we can do we can save money we can do clean up on the cheap or we can get it done faster most of the time those ideas go in the trash can but it puts you in a horrible situation because you have to fight for those dollars so I just want to uh will you commit to upholding the tri party agree between doe and the state of Washington and others in supporting Hanford cleanup and advocating for a budget that represents that commitment Senator I can't overstate how critical I think it is to finish the job finish the cleanup at Hanford the majority of our country's plutonium was produced there not just for the World War II but the post-war period and our Arsenal today so henford gave a lot to this country and and and we behind left left a mess and that needs to be cleaned up it's being cleaned up thanks in part to your efforts and many in your state to push for that but I I am firmly committed to continuing our obligations and our and our our moral uh obligation to clean up the mess that was left in your state under that legal framework I I will you can take it for the record but you you need to look at that and just say yes I believe in that legal legal framework you know it's it's it's the the process that's where people get into trouble because somebody else tries to redefine the agreement that's been made um or let's just make it simpler they try to redefine what is the waste and then they try to reclassify very hazardous waste into something else and then just say we're just going to leave it in the tanks or grounds which are leaking and we don't want those leaky tanks and those uh sources of of of very severe issues okay secondly do you believe in hold upholding investments in our cap capabilities in our National Labs particularly when it comes to the issue of AI and Quantum I think you and I had a chance to have this conversation we think both of these things have major implications but we have to have our Labs continuing to play a leadership role with the right amount of funding uh to continue a very important competitive and National Security agenda for our nation I agree very much with your comment and your question Senator n pnnl has done fabulous work in this area cyber security is a growing threat it's not obvious to all Americans because we don't see it but it's the infiltration into our systems across our government and our industry um from foreign actors is huge and driving that research forward is critical for the security of our country economic and geopolitical security of our country great um I know you know a lot about fusion um do you think it's time that we look at Fusion and um uh let's just say the Tri Cities is doing everything okay so they're they're very much a hub for a lot of different energy Innovation because of both the long history of the handford cleanup and the National Lab footprint and a lot of diff just natural resource issues but do you think when it comes to um Fusion that we ought to be more aggressive of thinking about in case this does become a reality Supply chain and uh grid grid integration do you think that would be behoove us as a nation to be faster at our deployment of such technology if we knew what those supply chain issues were now and identifying them and identifying what a faster process for getting something like that integrated into the grid would look like yes yes Senator this is an exciting new technology with again just huge room to run and it's moved very rap rapidly the last decade has seen more progress than in my lifetime and uh I would love to see that come uh to commercial power in the next decade great and then just last doe has invested more than 14 billion in um us power grid and many states have had grid resiliency programs I hope you will continue to support those projects grid resiliency as as I've talked throughout this hearing is is critical it's the most urgent energy issue we have today thank you thank you Mr chairman thank you in just a moment we're going to turn to another one of our new members who comes from an energy rich State a state with some oil refineries as well uh Senator McCormack before I do that I just want to clarify one thing you submitted your paperwork in a timely manner um and uh your paperwork now having received the final certification last night before close of business should it trigger any questions you'll make your save available to members should they have any is that right absolutely any questions about my disclosures or paperwork please just reach directly out to me Senator MCC thank you Mr chairman Mr Right good to good to see you it was great to have a meeting with you and I'm excited about working with you and uh we we believe in Pennsylvania the road to energy dominance goes through Pennsylvania and it's critical to our uh future in Pennsylvania so I'm gonna I'm G to ask you a couple questions forgive me their parochial but I want to stay focused on the things that matter to Pennsylvan I'm going to hopefully do a quick lightning round here with you first the east coast is at a sign significant disadvantage on LG export capacity compared to the Gulf Coast which is a big problem for getting Pennsylvania energy production to other parts of the countries allies around the world can we work together on getting export terminals online starting in southeast Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia Senator the more energy infrastructure we have in this country the better for America the better for Americans the better for Pennsylvania I agree very much with your desire there I've expressed that that view many times we have the Marcus Hook teral terminal for Natural Gas Liquids but not for the main the main event for methane and for natural gas would be hugely beneficial to Pennsylvania and to our country to have access at ex LG export terminal on on the Pennsylvania Coast near Philly great thank you uh you know we can't power the AI Revolution without cheap and reliable power for data centers and Tech clusters in Pennsylvania we've seen recently an Innovative approach with a Microsoft um arrangement with 3m Island uh you and I spoke uh when we were together about the the potential for penssylvania to become really a leader uh with energy and AI uh going hand in hand and so as we discussed our meeting I'm I'm putting together a Pennsylvania energy and Innovation Summit later this year to bring together the energy sector leading AI companies huge sources of capital Global Investors to deliver on President Trump's Vision to unleash American Energy en and technological leadership and so I'm looking forward to working with you and secretary berham on that uh can I count on your support we had a great dialogue about that Senator and absolutely you can count on my support it's a it's a great way to frame this issue if we want to build a new American industry in artificial intelligence and we want to lead the world in that industry and boy for our economic and National Security we better it's you can't build any new industry without the energy to support it so this you you this Vision that's a great coming together of a new manufacturing industry to manufacture intelligence and use the energy resources you have in Pennsylvania and attract the private investment Capital to make it happen I'm all in on that thank you uh finally we have a major opportunity in Pennsylvania to leverage our natural gas resources and carbon capture and storage Technologies to produce blue hydrogen will the Trump Administration with with your leadership ensure that Federal support for the hydrogen development does not disadvantage blue hydrogen projects uh Senator I I I know of what you speak but I would say too early for me to speak uh about tradeoffs between different Technologies uh and all that stuff any commitments there I will say again that the president um who I hope to be honored to serve is very passionate about energy about growing energy about growing America American production of energy with the end not just for energy in itself but to enable Better Lives for Americans stronger power economic and political security for our country everything part of that mission I think you'll see this administration's support great and finally the office of fossil energy has a storyed history of driving Innovations in the industry including contributions to the Shale Revolution one of the major Labs is in Pittsburgh how can we you know as you take uh leadership if confirmed at the helm here Revitalize this office to focus on the next generation of fossil fuel Innovations yes you know again fossil fuels again who've powered the world throughout all of my lifetime um and will continue to do so is somehow fallen out of fashion and out of favor so even though it's a critical technology for us there's been less interest to invest in it less interest to talk about it um I don't I don't share those aversions um I'm all about new technology to improve energy sources across the board of course including hydrocarbon energy sources as well one of the things the senator from Alaska said which I I'm excited about too is you're an innovator you're a scientist one of the consistent Trends we've seen over the past decades is the reduction in carbon emissions as a consequence of technological innovation uh so by developing these Innovations we have more National Security we have greater economic growth in places like Pennsylvania and we have a cleaner your environment what energy Innovations are you most excited about uh given the trends that you're seeing Oh there's so many but as you're talking there about natural gas in Pennsylvania it's been the biggest driver of reducing America's greenhouse gas Emissions on a per capita basis they were lower last year than any year since I was born like think about that this isn't a recent Trend this is any year since I was born and everyone knows my age now so I'm not going to say it but everyone knows it since it's it's my birthday but thank you Senator oh you're going to end on happy birthday thank you thank you Senator Senator King you picked a hell of a way to spend your birthday Mr Wright I think your position on climate change is more subtle than is publicly recognized as I understand it you don't deny that there is climate change happening in the world and that things like sea level rise and warming are occurring and that they're related to the combust of fossil fuels which has drastically increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is that correct absolutely Senator I enjoyed our dialogue about that and future dialogues about that but yeah I've been outspoken about this for probably at least 20 years the the mostly from the combustion of hydrocarbons to enable our modern worlds we've increased atmospheric Co CO2 concentration by 50% and that has affected absorbs infrared radiation makes it harder for the earth to shed heat but as I understand your your position is as I say more subtle you see a tension between diminishing our Reliance on fossil fuels and powering those six million people who don't have adequate energy sources today that's the kind of balance that you're talking about is that correct yeah well state center that that that is my view they energy is critical to human lives climate change is a global challenge that we need to solve and and they the tradeoffs between those two are the decisions politicians make and they're the decisions that'll impact the the future of our world and the quality of life those trade-offs are are critically important I think I think there are two observations one is you you've you've said there's no energy transition you're a walking energy transition what you did in your work in Shale was a was an energy revolution in this country that transitioned us in many ways toward natural gas uh so there is possible transition it can happen either slowly probably faster Fusion smrs battery storage all of those Technologies and I note that your company wasn't exclusively oil and gas but it also has investments in uh Battery Technology in uh nuclear smrs uh so you you do believe that we do need to diminish where we can the the the emission intensity of our manufacturer of energy absolutely Ely Senator you you're bringing me back to the great dialogue we had about energy about climate change about tradeoffs and and I I appreciate very much your comments today the I am for improving all Energy Technologies that can better human lives and reduce emissions they go together I would add one note however and I understand the tension and I think that's a a reasonable I I remember saying years ago we can't tell the the Indian uh nation that they can't have air conditioning uh because we don't want them to be uh using energy the thing that has to be considered though is what if you're wrong what if what if we're wrong and something really drastic happens my concern that isn't discussed very much is a climate effect on the Atlantic currents if something happened to the Gulf Stream Britain Scandinavia would be uninhabitable so I I think we need to bear in mind that it's it's not as easy as saying we're going to help the third world and we're going to keep burning fossil fuels there is a significant risk that we have to have in our calculation would you agree Senator I I agree with that comment as well you know in my writings on on climate change what what I record a lot and talk about is what we do know which is the past up to today predictions are hard particularly about the future and so I yeah I think we need to be humble about that we don't know what's coming in the future um but advancement of Energy Technologies that grow the amount of of energy we have the cost drive down the cost the quality and lower emissions those are all wins in all scenarios and I'm hoping that 10 years from now we'll look back on this discussion as rather quaint because if technology will have solved the problem uh we're all working in in that direction a couple of very quick questions uh you have the department of energy has a role in approving LNG uh export terminals uh it's supposed to determine the public interest and I think Senator Herona asked this but I want to confirm uh that your office your department will consider the effect on domestic natural gas prices of expanded LNG export capacity uh absolutely true Senator no nothing is more important than the supply the affordability and the access to energy to Americans in America so absolutely that's a critical factor in that in that determination and one other question I want to a couple of others I want to underline uh improving the energy structure of this country includes uh improved transmission is that correct absolutely that's one of our major bottlenecks today and one of the things I hope you will continue research on is what are what are called gets uh grid enhancing Technologies which are non you don't have to build a whole new tower you can Rec conductor there are Technologies to improve the throughput of of our grid that I think is a direction we should move in I I commend the research on that to your department thank you and I agree with that comment as well Senator actually was a dinner discussion last night well I I appreciate your testimony here today and uh look forward to working with you uh this is a critical area you bring a unique perspective and and breadth of knowledge uh and I appreciate your willingness to take on this challenge thank you thank you Mr chairman thank you Senator Senator Danes Chris good to have you here I get the best view here to see your family see Liz and uh had a grandbaby there for a while but as a a new grandfather like you of of uh of six I understand sometimes you have to step out with those busy moms and dads but I did get a picture of that with your grandbaby there I sent it to you as well so you'll have that as a memory from today but it's great to have you here I mean uh your track record is amazing there an innovator a scientist uh mechanical engineer electrical engineer I'm a chemical engineer so we could geek out here for a moment but I just appreciate your thoughtfulness looking at tradeoffs in this you know complex areas it relates to energy and being thoughtful and intentional going forward here with getting the right policies uh for our country so thank you for stepping into the public service world uh it's a sacrifice for you and your sweet family and I want to thank you both for doing that uh as I step back and look at the numbers at 30,000 foot view think we're going to need 50% more energy in the next 25 years than we currently consume today globally this has got to be a discussion increasingly on how do we increase how do we get more energy not less as we think about these tradeoffs I think you play a really critical role here um when confirmed as our secretary of energy uh the last four years I've seen I think taking some steps backward unfortunately we saw pauses on LG exports prohibiting new coal leasing in eastern Montana uh putting a pause overall on oil and gas development even trying to ban new gas appliances uh I think that's out of touch where the reality is and that's why I appreciate I think your pragmatism as you look at where truth is where physics are and what the demand is going forward one of the first things you can do as secretary I think is to refocus the department on Pro baseload energy policies Bas load power resources like coal natural gas hydr power nuclear I think will ensure that we have access to Reliable and affordable energy year round whether it rains or snows or the sun shining or not the world needs more energy not less and with a proliferation of data centers thinking about you know how does Google and Microsoft and others think about it right now that they're they're buying baseload power they need to think about baseload power as a way here to fund what they need to do here is it relates to the Revolution going on in AI blockchain Tech Technologies Quantum Computing the load is I think I think the 50% forecast of more is probably low in in in where this is probably actually going to land here and you can help us get ahead of that curve so so here's my secret my question Mr secretary to be um will you promote policies both at doe and throughout the government that will expand energy development and ensure that reliable and affordable basad sources of Power are protected absolutely Senator if I get the the honor and the privilege to be confirmed and to serve top goal of mine you just summarized the top goal our electricity grid as as I've said earlier in the testimony today it's become more expensive and less reliable reversing a hundred-year trend where that was becoming cheaper in inflation adjusted cost and more reliable and we've gone the other direction we cannot go that direction that's not good for America it's not good for our Industries and um that is a top priority of mine to work I think we violently agree that reducing emissions is better through Innovation not regulation um what what are some ways you think about how Innovation could help Drive reduction in emissions yeah I mean if you look at at at at the track record right now almost all of the emission reductions in our country and across the globe almost all of them have come from Innovations you know in the United States the biggest one by far is been the arrival of lowcost natural gas through the Shale Revolution that was Innovation it was not imposed we got lowcost gas lower emission gas not just lower greenhouse gas emissions but lower pollutants lower particulate matter lower socks lower knocks that helps air quality countries that have reduced a lot of country emission reductions that have been from regulation and from top down mandates have actually not been the emissions reductions they appear to be they've more been an emissions removal you know if you shut down industry in your country or in your state the emissions from that industry don't go away they just go somewhere else and if they go out of the United States with the cleanest and most advanced manufacturing technology those emissions just go up so really the only Pathway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lift up people's quality of life is through energy Innovation and um and America's been a hot bed of that and we need to return turn a Vigor and a focus on Innovation on energy right here in this country all right I'm out of time one final quick sentence statement is uh as you know Montana is becoming a Quantum Powerhouse and places like bosam in my hometown are leading some of this high-tech Innovation uh we've got the the quantum leadership act that we're working on to Spur more jobs and research in this area um my question is when confirmed will you work with me to bolster Quantum and other nextg Technologies not only I will more importantly this Administration will this Administration and president-elect Trump is passionate about leading the Next Generation Industries and leading them here in America absolutely great thank love your passion thank you yeah he would well I was out okay we'll turn next to another new member of our committee uh the great senator from the great state of Arkansas Senator cutton thank you Mr chairman Mr Wright congratulations on your nomination I apologize for my tardiness I've been presiding over John ratliff's hearing at the intelligence committee um a Geological Survey recently found anywhere from 5 to 19 million tons of lithium reserves in the Smackover formation uh in particular in South Arkansas can you commit to working with my office to feasibly develop this rare and strategically vital supply of minerals Senator thanks for your question thanks for your service to our country um and absolutely this this is a different lithium production technology to get it out of brinds there seems to be an enormous resource of it in in Arkansas into the south of you and uh I think that's an area of critical interest to our country and should be looked at evaluated in and uh if it's commercially viable developed thank you very much for that commitment um one of the responsibilities of the Department of energy that is sometimes over overlooked is the National Laboratories we do everything from nuclear development to Quantum Computing and other high-tech Cutting Edge unfortunately these Laboratories are a target of foreign Espionage in fiscal year 2023 more than 8,000 citizens from China and Russia were granted access to doe National Labs out of a total of 40,000 foreign users it's my opinion and the opinion of many other senators in particular on the intelligence committee that the department of energy energy cannot continue to allow adversarial Nations to exploit milit military and dual use Technologies for their own gain what steps can you take to ensure that the Department's National Labs and other sensitive facilities are not compromised by our adversaries thank you for the question Senator thank you for your concern and focus on this issue i' I've spoken at length today about what a treasure our National Labs are how they've transformed our country to where it exists today and how they are really a vector to transform our country going forward as well um but if we have American innovation funded by American taxpayers performed by American citizens walk out the door and go to our foes uh for free and without knowing it clearly that undermines our national security that undermines our Economic Security um I'm aware of of the problem in concept if I have the privilege to be confirmed and serve in this role I will quickly learn a lot more about the problem uh including working with the team there and across the administration to find solutions to this critical problem you've identified I agree with you about the gravity of the threat and the need to address it thank you I I appreciate it I'll just say that in our experience many of the Personnel at the labs are brilliant scientist who go on to become managers but often times they have a purely scientific mindset and they have it in their minds that they collaborate openly with fellow scientists from around the world which may be fine if we're dealing with French scientist or Japanese scientist but I'd say it's not the case with Chinese and Russian scientists I'd also point out that the equivalent kinds of sites in China and Russia are not nearly so open to American scientists and that would violate president Trump's treasured principle of reciprocity with foreign Nations finally uh another key responsibility of the Department of energy is sometimes overlooked is the national nuclear Security Administration actually constitutes almost 50% of the Department's budget um Can can you give us assurances that you'll Advocate that the nnsa receives adequate resources to complete this top priority mission for our national security absolutely Senator I have significant concerns in that area you know are uranium en enrichment capabilities in the United States have been denuded over the last few decades even our ability to produce PL plutonium pits has collapsed to nearly nothing there's some efforts in place to reverse that but I want to make sure they move as fast and expeditiously as possible that is the ultimate guaran of the sovereignty of our nation is our nuclear Arsenal that is not something we can cut corners on and not worry about well thank you very much I I appreciate again your testimony and your answers on the critical questions that are not always highlighted uh when you think about the department of energy but they cross into our work on the armed services committee and on the intelligence committee where I believe we'll see you in the future as well um in addition to vital energy development questions like the Smackover formation so thank you very much for your testimony congratulations again I look forward to working with you thank you Senator particularly for working two hearings at the same time thank you Senator cutton um round one is now complete and hereby notify all members if you want to participate in a round two uh come back right away because round two tends to go pretty fast we'll start that now again with five minute rounds um the beginning of my second round I just want to ask you a little bit about the department of Energy's um Appliance standards programs uh some of these regulations um are of concern or at least ought to be noticed by the American people as they impact all Americans in one way or another they reach uh almost all equipment that uses energy to any significant degree in Americans homes so dishwashers clothes dryers cloth washers uh light bulbs and and a whole lot more there are consumer protections of course built into the statute uh protections that were designed to ensure that things wouldn't get too expensive and that you know quality didn't fall off the table in connection with them but in contrast to the previous Trump Administration the Biden Administration has run somewhat rough shot over some of those U consumer protections built into the law this effort was of course in service of the Biden administration's whole of government focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions uh sometimes uh to the exclusion of authorized statutory mandates what will you do to ensure that maximum protections for American families uh and consumers will be um uh recognized and expected uh uh if you're confirmed as Energy Secretary when implementing the appliance standards program thank thank you Senator thank you for that question and for raising that concern I I can assure you that concern is on the mind of millions of Americans across the country it I I hear it very often you know we want to drive and the department of energy and the government wants to drive Innovation and more efficient Technologies meaning delivering the same end with less inputs that's advancement that's technology but to take Clos dryers for for example you know it it takes heat and it takes air flow and both of those take energy and I look at some new appliances today and well they use half the energy per minute but if it takes an hour to dry your clothes instead of 30 minutes to dry your clothes it's the same energy consumption and you lost a half an hour so does regulation go well beyond what's sensible and logical it it does a lot it does a lot and um what I want to do is look at what's happening there what's driving that analysis and are we playing a role of a reasonable regulator or are we trying to check boxes or or make achievements where the trade-offs are simply not worth it I think you should always be a little humble and a little cautious when you're proposing to reduce the choices of American consumers that is a that is a fair point especially when you're dealing with administrative promulgated rules that themselves have the effect of generally applicable federal law they're enforcable as such if they're not complied with they can result in massive fines they can result in somebody's business getting shut down they can even in some cases uh with some administratively prolongated regulations result in prison time if you fail to abide by them and so that's all the more important any time you're taking away consumer Choice uh that's of concern any time you're making new law uh outside the people's elected lawmaking branch that that's also concerned um we've got um a number of of of things in in front of us one of the things that I've enjoyed uh reading is this document which I understand you yourself wrote uh it's it's entitled bettering human lives and you see energy is playing a significant role in that um in this you take on a whole bunch of different issues including the fact that as a result of the fact that uh We As Americans have access to Reliable affordable clean electric power uh we're able to avoid a lot of problems that in many other countries they face for example you cite some alarming statistics from the government of Kenya the Kenyan Ministry of Health talking about respiratory infections tell me how those relate to the availability of affordable reliable uh electric power yeah I view this as maybe the senator the most urgent energy Challenge on the planet today which is just simply the access of basic clean cooking fuels also used for heating but all of our ancestors all stayed warm in cooked food burning wood and regrettably more than two billion people on the planet today still burn wood indoors sometimes charcoal or dung but mostly wood indoors to cook their meals and keep their house at a at a safe temperature that indoor air pollution kills over 2 million people every year like this is this is outrageous and it's entirely solvable and in fact one of the things I'm most proud of of the Shale Revolution is while we've well more than doubled oil production nearly doubled natural gas production we've quadrupled us propane production we've gone from the eighth largest exporter to by Far and Away the largest exporter and we're making propane that critical fuel that replaces wood to make people's lives longer healthier and more opportunity Rich lot to be proud of in this country but there's so many other energy challenges out there that are little known and therefore not addressed but we can do better indeed thank you Senator Henrik thank you chairman um so I I tend to approach in energy with four goals and one of the primary ones is affordability uh reliability is always non-negotiable uh that's critical and to the extent our policies can make them both abundant and clean those are things that are incredibly important to uh to my constituents and we've heard a lot about cost today and I know you and I talked a lot about affordability when uh when you visited me in my office and so I I pulled up the latest cost data for wholesale uh generation costs in cents per kilowatt hour from Lazard would you consider Lazard data to be Fairly reliable I mean um well Lazard is is Senator they were the easiest to pull up but they they're they're the they're the most famous for publishing statistics on levelized cost of energy no subsidies involved levelized levelized misses the boat on electricity generation because it it treats it like would you would you take an Uber that was 10% cheaper in cost if you didn't know when the Uber was going to show up and where it was going to drop you off so one of the reasons why I I raise this is because in in New Mexico um I think we have been able to do both of those things at the same time so we've pursued both affordability uh actually I should say all three things affordability reliability um but also uh clean and I know in 2023 there was a statement that you made that said you know wind and solar energy will quote likely never leave single digits um I guess as a percent of total energy and I know you understand the difference between the grid and transportation and and and heat energy that we use in our total energy uh balance but when it comes to the Grid in New Mexico in just uh my utility which we talked a little bit about in my office they now produce 58% of their generation from carbon free Renewables and nuclear nuclear being the smallest of that at about 7% uh wind and solar solar being 35% and wind being 15% of their kilowatt hours so that means that when you combine that with storage resources which are primarily getting charged by Clean excess Renewables that their penetration rates are now you know well into the 60s even the low 70s how do you know when when when Chris Wright says uh these resources will likely never leave single digits it's one thing but if the Secretary of Energy says that I think people will get the impression get a different impression so how do you square those those two very different data sets thank you Senator um and I appreciate the question I appreciate our shared interest in affordable reliable secure energy and I think New Mexico's done some great things there um globally which is what I talk about mostly in that report um in 2023 the last year we have full data wind solar and batteries were 2.6% of global primary energy um in the US they're a little more than 3% but not wildly higher than the global electricity only delivers 20% of global primary energy so getting to you know 50% in electricity which would be an incredibly High penetration that would that would be double digits um but where most of the energy is consumed in the world today in where it's growing the fastest is in South Asia southeast Asia um northern Africa and and through the well mostly South Asia and Southeast Asia the these are countries with very poor wind resources and actually not very good solar resources India's got some dry places and some deserts and good resources but Vietnam Malaysia um Indonesia if you go to the places where energy growth is rising the fastest they don't have great energy they don't have great wind and solar resources that was the context of your your statement Global energy cuz I want to I want to make sure that we understand you know what what we as a country are accomplishing and if you just look back at the last year worth of data of the first 11 months of 2024 and you look at new generation the vast majority of that and I don't have the figure in front of me but it came out in the last couple weeks the vast vast majority of that is all clean energy and so if we can take some of these lessons from what we've been able to accomplish as a world leader in energy and and use them to help uh people in the world have access to the abundance that you talk about I I just think it's important understand the rate of change in some of these systems is not linear and so we're seeing like for example last year in the US the vast majority of that generation on the electric grid being clean I agree Senator thank you and I appreciate your your passion for numbers and energy as well thank you for that good comments we need more data guys Senator Meli thank you Mr chairman and uh I appreciate the opportunity for a second round here um uh I mentioned critical minerals uh I'd like to ask you more a little a little bit more about geothermal because as as we think about these areas of opportunity um there's a lot of focus on wind and solar and I don't mean to be pointing to my friend from Colorado there but um geothermal is kind of like it's the mature Tech technology because it's been around for a while but the technologies that are being used nowadays are not necessarily uh what we have seen in the past you have had an interest in this um a business interest and I'm a little bit excited to know what you think the potential is for you in this new role At Doe to help accelerate more in the geothermal development space and reduce some of the project uncertainty so I'm I'm looking for for better Assurance for some of those bright people who have these crazy wild ideas that we can do things on adak and and on Alaska and and out on Mount spur to to try to reduce these these barriers to entry in in an energy area that's been around for a long time that should not be so hard what can we do and are you excited about it from a doe perspective very much so very much so look I'm I'm uprooting my life and moving to Washington DC if I get the honor and privilege of being confirmed because I love energy all kinds of energy for all Americans and and I love that you highlight geothermal just tremendous potential energy source I worked on this 30 some years ago and wrote some papers about it and a new idea called hot dry rock where geothermal today is where there's Hot Rocks approachable they have fractures in them so fluid can flow and they're full of water well that's a small set of the microcosm but anywhere we drill right here we drill three miles underground it's exceedingly hot that energy is sitting there so the idea of hot dry rock is to inject water into a well flow through that rock and therefore take some of the heat out of that rock and make that water very hot and then flow it up and produce electricity from it produce heating for homes or houses it just an enormous abundant energy resource below everyone's feet can I interrupt you and just ask you to save that energy and passion for when you are confirmed as Secretary of Energy and and Elevate this within the department um I know everybody wants to get to the top of the list but if if I can express disappointment with what I have seen within the department of energy over the years we've seen great things in great areas and geothermal just kind of sits back there as as kind of the Forgotten child and we're not we're not going to allow that to happen so I appreciate that passion um let me ask you about uh about Alaska's natural gas you've talked a lot about how the um uh how we've really seen this this revolution when it comes to to being able to access our natural gas through the fracking um you know Alaska you've been up there you know our issues um Congress has approved a a loan guarantee for for an Alaska gas line and I would just ask for your support if confirmed that you're going to work with the delegation to help stand up the loan guarantee through regulations whatever may be necessary to ensure that Doe can actually accept the the application when the project proponents are ready it should be an easy answer yes Senator tremendous resources in Alaska of oil natural gas minerals min logging geothermal you've got it all you've got it all and to grow natural gas production in Alaska and build infrastructure to export that to the world given how close it is to the biggest fastest growing markets in the world in Asia I think is a tremendous idea great for our country great for Alaska and I'm confident that President elect Trump will be a will be a champion of these ideas of growing American energy production and influence in the world well we've got it as you mentioned we have it um uh and we're we're ready willing um we just need good partners at the federal level to help us Advance this and last point on that we have seen some really um critical energy investments in Alaska as a result of the infrastructure investment jobs act um a lot of folks on this committee helped with that but the doe programs that are funded by AA have have provided a lot of benefit to project so far U most of them are already underway they range for everything from the renewable uh the rural renewable energy Investments uh carbon storage um transmission upgrades is huge demonstration of of long duration storage so I just want your assurance that we're going to um we're going to still be able to continue these projects as a priority with in due what we have started we don't want to have a a a drop off here we want to have a smooth transition for these existing doe projects to be able to continue to allow us to build out that uh that infrastructure that uh that transmission capacity that's going to um allow for a betterment of alaskans and and really our opportunity to help Americans I'm thrilled to see the breadth of energy innovation in Alaska and would love to see that continue and expect that it will continue are you going to come up and visit absolutely I figured it didn't take much of an invitation I appreciate the fact that you've got uh uh you've got ties to the area already and um I appreciate that but thank you for your willingness to give the committee this much time I know that you've got a lot more energy but I think that your grandson is probably bored with us so might be time to end Mr chairman I think his grandson seems riveted actually uh before we go to Senator hicken Looper uh I'll note that love the geothermal discussion um uh Senator Heinrich and I have a a bill together uh on geothermal we've got access to heat like that might as well harness it just as we would with puff Magic Dragon if we could find and harness him and we'd make power out of him somehow Senator hicken Looper and then we'll go to Senator Hoven thank you Mr chair um and again glad to back I I don't think I have to extend an invitation to come to Colorado I accept and I do appreciate uh and there was some understand how quickly things were working and how hard hard you work to get your uh financial information your ethical disclosures the FBI background check that we didn't get it until I didn't never saw us I had a dinner last night uh and then I had meetings starting this morning um but I do look at geothermal which I share your enthusiasm and and want to ask a question about how rapidly you think it can scale but it is is something so Pro promising uh obviously you thought through your conflict of interest in something like that where you've you've helped you dramatically uh uh you've been part of the Catalyst to allow the geothermal that we can imagine it scale at least I can I'm imagining at scale uh you s you thought through that I don't have any of the numbers in front of me yet yeah thank you for that that question Senator but my involvement with a particular company I think a leader in Next Generation geothermal fero energy I will sever all TI Financial involvement with fvo in everything I do in energy I'm still pass about it I'm going to be a champion for it but and and even in my world in the small modular reactor our company and I'm a director of one of those small modular reactor companies but I'm cheering for all of them and yes I will sever all of my ties from across the whole energy space but but I won't sever my passion for seeing those Technologies advance to better American lives I appreciate that and I appreciate that you're open to discussing it with other Senators if they have if they once they've seen that those documents that they have questions that I I appreciate that absolutely yeah given the compressed time frame if anyone has any questions about anything in my disclosure form as you know sometimes to your detriment uh I'm an open book and so are you fair enough um in in terms of geothermal and I you know the the details better than I how rapid can we get that to scale because it the the the transformational capability of that as you've described before it it can do some of the making of things it can be high temperature that actually does uh display displace uh hydrocarbons in a successful way so fvo right now is building a 400 megawatt plant in Senator Lee's State um and uh and one of the reasons they can do it in that scale is there already is nearby electrical infrastructure but Senator we'll Circle back to everyone's top issue today one of the limiters in the growth of geothermal is there's so many resources out there but there aren't easy ways to connect to power lines to sell that power to users there are a number so we're going to see gigawatts come on in the next few years but could it be tens of gigawatts with infrastructure it could well we're aligned on that and we have I have a couple bills that we've worked on uh the big wires act you'll you'll you'll get immersed in all that uh soon enough let me talk a little bit about nuclear waste because we haven't really talked about that but I uh you know I was someone when I was a kid protested against nuclear energy uh couldn't get my arms around how we deal with the waste uh I think looking now at some of the risks of climate change and the the potential the possibility that acceleration of climate change is worse than they think um makes those the the nuclear the issues around the waist we still have to deal with it and deal with it safely have you got any ideas of how to do that and and and help uh especially some of the younger people in this country are very concerned about that about nuclear as a as a solution tion but it is it's clean it's it has high temperature capability it can do so many things if we can figure out how to deal with the waste yeah and I think that the concern of of kids and us when we were young and everyone else of nuclear and and of climate change they're all very Justified concerns these are real things radioactive materials are dangerous um but fortunately I think with engineering and sensible regulation and safeguards um I think the nuclear waste problem is one of the most manageable problems cuz the volume of waste is relatively small like we've been selling commercial nuclear power for over 70 years and all of that waste today is in swimming pools on location cooling off at the start and then it's in Big Dry casks right on location in urban or Suburban areas so and it's been there for 70 years and the radioactivity near those power plants is lower than Grand Central Station in New York City the subway station so I think even without per perent repository we've been able to do that in a safe way it's better in the long run to have a more remote probably deep storage but there's many ways to do it I think the politics of it are the trickiest part but they matter we you need to have people on board we don't want people with fear and anxiety about what's going on so it's a political and social challenge but technically can we deal with nuclear waste safely I I I believe firmly we can and we have well thank you and I'm out of time but I do I think that discussion we're going to have to figure out how to have that National discussion to make sure people are aware of how engineering and how technology and Innovation can help us make sure that is truly safe thank you thank you Senator I hope we're not actually seeing them in swimming pools where people are swimming I Senator hovind thank you Mr chairman uh Chris I'm also on defense Appropriations and I just want to follow up for a minute on a question that was asked by Senator Tom Cotton and that's the work of the nns say in the National Labs in regard to our uh military uh in my state we have the only dual nuclear uh mission base Air Force Base in the country yes and the work at the nnsa and the National Labs is vital as we upgrade our nuclear Triad will you commit to work with me on that very important uh function uh for de on behalf of our country and the you know our military absolutely Senator this is foundational to our security to our way of life right on uh I want to thank you for your uh very open and articulate responses across the board this morning uh just an outstanding job uh and I mean it open knowledgeable uh and articulate and I think all of us on the committee could see that very clearly and the only other thing I would uh put forth is there anything else that you would want to put on the record I just want to give you that opportunity uh you know before uh we adjourn and and the chairman May well do that as well but if there is anything else I want to give you that opportunity anything you wanted to respond to or anything else uh that you wanted on the record oh thank you senator for that I'll end with just a a couple comments that have been in my mind one is to come back to Senator Heinrich and say New Mexico has fantastic solar and wind resources and you've responsibly developed them so look I I don't I don't want you to feel there's a more tension or disagreement there than it than it sounds like the other thing I'll end with and I think we share that everyone in this room is that the importance of energy and the affordability of it 10% of Americans got a disconnection notice to their utilities in the last 12 months you know more than 20% of Americans report struggles paying their bills whether it's paying their energy bills you know whether it's filling their car with gas or heating their home or paying their their electricity bill so this is important it's not just important for National Security and Industry and all that it's important for the quality qu of Life of every American so I thank everyone on this committee to be dedicated to energy and natural resources um I'm honored would be honored to work with you all on this just critically important thing energy is the infrastructure of life it's what makes everything possible thank you all for the uh great dialogue questions today and thank you for your service to our country thank you so much uh Mr Wright I really appreciate you being here uh my colleagues and I we can be a lively bunch and you've handled our questions responded well to them and U I appreciate your family coming I want to thank the uh members of the committee the committee staff and especially the Capitol Police who have been here today to keep us safe and keep things orderly thank you for your work the record for today um uh we will stand open and ready to receive questions for the record until 6 pm today and uh we stand adjourned thank you very much thank you e",

        "bring in show music please hi I'm CNBC producer Katie Kramer today on squa pod former house Speaker Paul Ryan he swapped the hill for seite Consulting and he says there's optimism heading into the inauguration these CEOs see you know an A Team being put in place on the economy and they're ready to go but the key for the GOP is delivering on all that promise it's all about not having Republican f ISM erupt cuz if you break into factions you can't get your agenda passed especially with these narrow margins and where Los Angeles is leadership lands as the city plans a rebuild after wildfires crisis management expert Eric deshal the only thing that matters in this news cycle is blame nobody wants to talk about Solutions it's all about blame all of that today plus the SEC has sued Elon Musk Microsoft is cutting back and Zuckerberg who the evolution of the world's third richest man he totally he's not the same Mark Zuckerberg well I think it actually started with the mixed martial arts training it's Wednesday January 15th 2025 squawk pod begins right now stand Becky by in 3 2 1 C please good morning everybody and welcome to squawkbox right here on CNBC we're live from the NASDAQ Market site in Times Square I'm Becky quick along with Joe kernin and Andrew Ross sorin the SEC uh filed a a lawsuit against Elon Musk yesterday accusing the billionaire of committing Securities fraud back in 2022 by failing to disclose he had amassed an act an active stake in Twitter the SEC says musk was 10 days late in reporting that he had built a position greater than 5% and that the delay uh in reporting allowed him to underpay by at least $150 million uh for shares he later purchased he got such a deal on those Twitter shares uh and a lost how much money an attorney um from us called the case a sham uh and a Ticky Tac complaint not a Ticky talk complaint Ticky Tac and said the sec's action was an admission that they cannot bring an actual case and SEC spokesperson said that the litigation release is in their words literally an actual case brought by the SEC they declined to comment further and a post on X musk called the SEC a totally broken organization it's unclear how the SEC will proceed the case under the Trump Administration I have a pretty good idea but it's unclear at this point you wonder if this was a Parting Shot um exactly there's a lot of parting shots that uh that we're seeing how many more days what's it uh five more days five six more days well the qu to me though I imagine and we got to look into the details of just how it how it all happened if you if there's if there's a rule that says you need to disclose by next day and you don't accounting Rule and you don't do it yeah then you pay and and I say it's like a fine and in this case it would be a fee right uh but that's and I I remember at the time yeah I remember at the time it was a big deal because I think it was not only that he didn't disclose I think it was he was saying he was not looking to be an active manag an active um uh manager or to try and change and sway the company that he was going to be a passive investor and I think that that was marked uh incorrectly at the time too now maybe he was changing his mind over that period of time but that was the like trying to go back and I think that one of the reasons they were trying to get the the depositions in the testimony was the idea of trying to understand what actually was going on not just to people's minds but the phone conversations the emails about what in fact was really happening in this particular moment and as for being a bad deal I would actually argue to you it is probably even economically the best deal he's ever oh yeah but it just in terms of uh how much market cap Twitter has lost since see oh what no but what I was going to say is it's the best deal he's ever made because he the AI stuff for Gro well that's what I was going to say so all of a sudden he has bought this funnel of data that's going to have a Hu I I and I've always said this I was not always in the category of oh he's going to lose his shirt I was in the category of he's going to turn this thing and actually make money out of this thing somay and you say somay you say someday I think actually we're probably theing was about how much the banks lost and you know the loans that were made and it was a bad deal I mean the there were certain parts of of media that just loved the valuation of Twitter and how much money he had what what did he pay for it and what's it worth now well a lot of it wasn't hisy too he had so many what I mean and that the banks got killed and and everything else so maybe there was always a method uh to the madness but I I don't think he got a good deal when when he bought it I don't think he was able to buy it on the cheap I think he way overpaid for it he wanted out of it at the time I'm not disagree I'm just saying but in the totality of life when we look back on this it will turn out to be that both the actual both the actual Twitter because of what he's been able to do with grock and what It ultimately has done to his influence and therefore the valuations the Free World in the First Amendment yes it was a very good it very good for Humanity and for all of us so we should all be celebrating and I agree with you oh okay on that Moe let me move on quickly you guys agree uh speaking of Elon Musk he will be in attendance at president-elect Trump's inauguration on Monday along with billionaires Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg that's according to an official involved in the planning of the event who said that they would have a prominent spot at the ceremony all three of them by the way musk Bezos and Zuckerberg are currently the three richest people in the world according to the Bloomberg billionaires index in that order musk Bezos Zuckerberg Monday is a market holiday but CNBC will bring you special coverage of the Inauguration live from Washington that coverage starts at 9:00 a.m. eastern time we're going to be talking to a lot of special guests including Stanley duam Miller who's going to talk to us about what he's concerned about just in terms of government spending how we try and get control on that um but a lot of big guests who will be coming to us from that coverage and again it all starts at 9:00 a.m. on Monday morning Microsoft planning to pause hiring in part of its us Consulting business this is part of a cost cutting plan it's according to an internal memo that's also instructing employees not to expense travel for any internal meetings but to use remote sessions instead Executives going to have to authorize trips to customers sites to ensure that spending is being used on the right customers really that's such a weird thing to think about when you think about how much they're spending overall on AI right now and getting other things out you know I guess you got to look at all taking place you got to look at everything you do uh meta platforms meanwhile cutting about 5% of its Workforce focusing on the company's lowest performing staffers on an internal uh Forum or in an internal Forum CEO Mark Zuckerberg informed employees that the company would be moving out low performers faster he told workers that uh 2025 will be an intense year like the low for the yeah for the lower performance not not in a good way this is what um Brian chesky called founder mode you remember the idea of like stop listening to everybody else around you mhm do what your gut says even when unpopular mhm and this is what this this is what Mark Zuckerberg is now doing and you can see it across the entire enter I'll started with the hair used to be really short remember I like it longer too but he's like is it is he totally he's not the same Mark Zuckerberg well I I think it actually started with the mixed martial arts training that was a few years ago in the surfing with the looking cool with the flag and and stuff remember that yeah in Fourth of July okay let's go coming up he's I I like him a lot more and let's go move it or lose it chees will be next coming up on squawk pod the road ahead for Republicans the party's lofty plans for a giant reconciliation Bill we'll talk to former speaker Paul Ryan it will take a while it's a sequence of bills you first have to build your Baseline pass your budget then do reconciliation fastest they could probably do this is probably July plus he left Congress during the first Trump Administration what do Ryan think about Maga now as Donald Trump prepares for a second time on the capital steps of course you want Trump to succeed you're a republican here look I'm a Conservative Republican my brand of conservatism doesn't always overlap with Trump populism we'll be right back this is squawk pod you're watching squawkbox right here on CNBC I'm Andrew Al sorin along with Joe kernin and Becky quick president-elect Trump is ready to take office in 5 days and a big agenda item for him this year will be reauthorizing those tax cuts and job Acts than getting the economy back on track joining us right now to talk about this and more is former house Speaker Paul Ryan he is the chair of Tao and a partner at solir Capital and uh Paul thank you very much for being good to be back happy New Year uh let's I want to talk about a lot of things and what your expectations are but I know you've got your focus on the tax cuts Bill and and whether that will be uh reauthorized coming up this year that was something you had fought for I think you've called it your white whale it is it was one of my biggest U goals in Congress was to do tax reform it's coming up for reauthorization we couldn't make everything permanent we made the corporate side permanent uh this is the individual side but it affects a lot of businesses and when you have these kinds of tight margins like you do in the house and you're doing reconciliation it is going to be a tough needle thread um that's why to me Republicans need to stay unified look I want to see Trump succeed I I wish him well if he succeeds we all succeed as a country and there's all of this optimism that's coming through the country we just at too we surveyed 700 Global CEOs and investors representing $1 trillion in market cap it's a 32 point swing in optimism but from when a year ago from a year ago so that kind of optimism um will be will manifest itself if Congress delivers on these policies that means this reconciliation bill has to pass it is going to be a very hard to write so to me it it's all about not having Republican factionalism erupt because if you break into factions you can't get your agenda passed especially with these narrow margins so to me it's really really important that Republicans stay unified get this done and I think they're going to do it it will take a while it's a sequence of bills you first have to build your Baseline pass your budget then do reconciliation fastest they could probably do this is probably July but but there have been there's been this idea for one big beautiful plan that that Mike Johnson and I think the Ways and Means Committee were kind of favoring one big plan to put all of this together instead of using reconciliation twice which you have the opportunity to do this year Kim strel from The Wall Street Journal says not doing it twice not using that gift is like flushing this gift down the toilet I I did it twice in 2017 I've I spent my whole career in Congress working in the reconciliation law it's actually been should it be one or should it be two I'm for whatever Mike Johnson and John th think it needs to be to get the agenda they think it's different I think they have different John th has a really nice cushion relative to the house he's got a 53 seat Senate Mike Mike Johnson he won't be at full strength until these special elections are done in the spring so you can't even pass anything very tough until then so frankly I would defer to Johnson and to Jason Smith at Ways and Means those are the Committees I come from I chaired budget Ways and Means then was speaker I would defer to those guys as to what they think is necessary to pass it and I think they're probably right one big beautiful bill with with immigration reform but border control and tax cuts is probably the way you go you uh you know I love you and I like to needle you and stuff but you know I love you comma Comm Comm so now so now you're calling for Unity I am calling for Unity well that's nice yeah would have been nice before the election he won look he won and the other thing I thought was funny that you said was when you said hey look I want Trump to succeed you know who that sounds like sounds like a Democrat it sounds like a Democrat saying you know Democrat sound like that of course you want Trump to succeed you're a republican here look I'm a Conservative Republican I'm a free market limited government say that's who I hear conservatism doesn't always overlap TR I understand but it was a it was binary you know we argued about that binary all along it was always binary and a vote not for Trump was a vote for KLA Harris can you imagine I know you want to back this here's the point a lot of this agenda my kind of conservatism Trump populism it overlaps we disagree on trade and things like that and not with trade fights on China but I'm not a big fan of all the tariffs on our allies but the point is all this other stuff the tax policy the Border policy the deregulatory policy very good for America very for it only gets done repic UniFi and I think it's important that Republicans stay unified do you think they will stay unified I do I do but it's going to be a challenge I've watched Congress erupt into the factions more often than not and when Mike Johnson's dealing with such a razor thin majority you know you have very you have no margin so that's why Joe is giving me he's riding me here because I think it's I wasn't I just think it's funny when you come on and say hey look I want Trump to succeed that sounds like what Democrats say the man won look he probably won the biggest political comeback in history I don't know I'm not familiar with the Grover Cleveland race but this is probably tops that one and you can say you know people saying 1% seven swing States you know doesn't need any help Andrew go ahead Paul you know what I think you know what I thought before but now that we have an opportunity to pass what I think is a very good agenda it's extremely important that he doesn't have to be reelected uh at this point so it seems he seems a little bit different he must be more palatable to you uh this time around yeah and my hope is that the by the end of his administration he makes good dent on entitlement reform that's what I I was just actually talking about what are the chances that not having to to run free election what are the chances that Doge actually finally looks at entitlements well Congress needs to look at entitlements Doge can do a lot there I think Congress what be led by by the leader of the party yeah ideal in an Ideal World in a Reconciliation bill you make the tax code permanent and the way you make it permanent is you put big savings in that bill that in the out years pays for the second decade that's how we measure it and you have really good entit reform that's the ideal reconciliation package you think that the the tax policy the extension of this is as is or do you think there's going to be a complete rethink of it you know a lot of folks are now looking for example uh the Wen school has done a new budget proposal model you know about it effectively brings actually the top corporate top individual rate actually down to 27% interestingly but also base what' you say B and then gets it gets rid of basically uh all deductions and then also moves the capital gains rate up to 27% it's very interesting I don't know if you think that Republicans Democrats get behind that or or the only reason I'm asking is the sort of format with which we're living with today is it that is that what we're will be voted on or do you think that people are going to bring all these other ideas t look I spent my entire adult life in tax reform um it everybody has a plan until you get punched in the face right right Mike Tyson getting this stuff through Congress is really really hard look I try to get rid of salt I'm I did a $10,000 uh salt deduction that now because of New York and California members has to be raised when you're passing something through the house you're relying on Blue State votes in the Senate they don't have blue State people so it's a totally different Dynamic quick answer your question is I think they're going to stick with the plan as it is I don't think they have the the the vote margin to go comprehensive different tax reform stick with the plan as it is make some modifications get it ped to his point the Doge guys first of all those guys could do a lot to help digitize government to bring sort of modern technology because they're technologists to making government in its payment rails and all of those things work much better so I think there's a case for optimism there but but to to my point is if the way reconciliation works if you want to make this tax code permanent and certainty is a big deal for the economy then you combine it with real savings that acrew in the out years and get yourself a nice debt reduction on top of it can I ask the ideal a very practical tax related question as it relates to the tech of it all when I say Tech you're talking about the rails and everything else there's been an argument for a very long time that taxes meaning individual taxes should just be able to be sent in a very easy way we've talked about putting it onto a card we've talked about uh having a easy to use web site where everybody can just do it and all that and there's always been push back both from the you know uh tax accountants who want the business in the systems but also frankly Republicans for a very long time who said we don't want to make it so easy I mean that has been a big push back uh you think that changes under this I think it changes I think this is something these Doge guys could do a lot of good on on on digitizing government um I always wanted the eitc to be baked into a person's paycheck so they could see work paying and and not have to wait to get not wait for a lump Su at the end of the year they I I couldn't when I was weing means I just wanted to make that happen the treasury Department still doesn't have the ability to even do that they don't have te tax credit for anybody who's play ability to do that so their rails are so screwed up their technology is so bad so I think that is that's where I'm hoping Doge but do you think people would would be okay with the idea of making it a lot easier to pay your tax I do I do I think we're going into the 21st century we've got to modernize all of these systems the way we pay for our infrastructure the way we file our taxes the way we transmit money through the system I'm working on a program at American Enterprise Institute to digitize the entire social safety net so we have digital safety nets you know so that we have programmable benefits so you have real work requirements you have you know food goes for food you you you can digitize all of these things I think there's a big a lot of conservatives are for that why why do you think that that that Donald Trump would necessarily look at the reform of entitlement programs and do it even though he doesn't have to run for re-election he he's a populist because he's popular republicanism overlap we have to it's going to happen What Joe said interest rates hey Paul we have to revisiting the unity thing in a Ser more well I was serious but in a more uh in a different way um are you surprised at Mike Johnson how how he survived with such a neurom morage really amazing and then my second thing is do you think Republicans could ever be like Democrats and do you remember how many times remember how many times hakee got he never lost they're like the I call him the board Collective they're like said right there though so so so you have to remember the mind they never do that the mind of a republican is as an individualist right a lot of the battles in Washington are individualism versus collectivism philosophically they can't do it Democrats traditionally are more collectivist therefore they're they're more happy to operate in that kind of a collective mode Republicans are historically because I think Democrats see it differently I think Democrats think that actually Republicans are more aligned with each other I'm it's a very interesting one's a heard a Reagan conservatives say I want to see Trump populism succeed because eight times out of 10 we agree on things and we're going to stick with the eight not focus on the are you at eight now I'm when before you leave I'm going to give you you come home I left the lights on for you you come home but but to the Mike Johnson question eight out of 10 the reason okay seven I don't know the reason round it up Mike Johnson won is because he's a very honest man yeah and everyone knows that when he talks to them he keeps his word even if he doesn't tell them what they want to hear they know it's truthful that's why Mike Johnson um is remain speaker of the house he represents a certain type of conservative there are others in the party that aren't his type but they know he's a straight shooter yeah Paul what's your sense of you advise a lot of CEOs now uh at corporations across the country and a lot of them are now put putting their support quite publicly even if they they might have been privately supportive I think many of them actually weren't and now they have switched somewhat potentially like you what do you think of that I I think they see a top tier economic team coming in to the government bence a top first round pick in any s lutnick perfect really good guy for Ken Keys he's literally the most qualified person in the country to be the assistant Secretary of Treasury for for tax you see Russ vote one of the young budget guys we had in the house he's one of the smartest budget guys in the country you see you know Kevin hasset very accomplished Economist with a bunch of experience I'm not a big protectionist but Jameson Greer who's going to be the USR the guy's a very credible guy really knows what he's doing so I think these CEOs see you know an A Team being put in place on the economy and they're ready to go that's what our survey tells us at too in solir we invest in founder businesses these Founders in these Middle Market businesses they're ready to go they think m&a is going to be unlocked this year when you say they because they see this this regulation you know Suffocation being lifted off the economy and they see tax policy being more predictable and more favorable and T too you see CEOs actually putting deals in place this is not just talking about talking being made that's why I say Republicans got to deliver yeah this optimism has to be translated into the policy that people are optimistic about taking place and when you have these narrow margins we can't factionalized we got to stay together to get this stuff done and that's why I think Mike Johnson is the perfect type of person to help deliver this and that's why a big beautiful bill whatever Mike thinks is the best way to go that's what we should do and it's ask is it a little bit different with Trump and Trump called a a couple of those guys and said you know they were they were going to hold out on Johnson and he called him that day and said you do not want to get on the wrong side of this I think yeah you we got there's we have about 18 months Maybe maybe even less you're saying we we that's amazing as a country we I know Congress has about a year and a half to get the Royal week yeah we we have about a year and a half to get stuff done and then in the who knows what's going to happen you're back I like it I'm happy eight out of 10 former speaker Paul Ryan Paul thank you very much for being here happy New Year next on squawk pod Wise Guys and the White House crisis Communications expert Eric deshal has a new book on Mob ties to the Oval Office and it comes pretty recent one of the cliches we always hear in Washington it's not the crime it's the coverup it turns out the coverup works really well you're listening to squawk pod from CNBC here's Becky quick up and Becky Q our next guest is a crisis PR veteran we're going to get his response to the California wildfires Plus share his unique insights on the White House's unusual alliances throughout US History joining us right now is Eric deshal he is the chairman of desen Hall resources he stepped away from his day-to-day duties at his company he's got a new book that's out this week it's called Wise Guys and the White House gangsters presidents and the deals they made and we'll tease it for now just to say that you go back through lots of administrations and this is not just a history book you're looking at current administrations too and we're going to talk about that in just a second uh but why don't we start with what's happening with the California wildfires already we are seeing uh the blame game taking place what happened what went wrong uh how was this allowed to get so bad was the was the state and the city were they prepared for what's happened here I remember years ago there was an LA earthquake and I was watching the news coverage and somebody a reporter went up to a town manager and said what went wrong here and I thought well the Earth moved and so what what's happening now is the only thing that matters in this news cycle is blame that is the only thing people are going to want to talk about nobody wants to talk about Solutions it's all about blame the uh the mayor really cannot recover from something like this she was out of the country she out Ghana she slashed the the fire department's budget of dollars and I I think that when you are a mayor when you somebody in this situation the whole idea in politics is it's it's all about accepting credit for things you didn't accomplish and taking the blame for things you didn't cause she is going to take all the blame there's nothing that can be done about it the one that's more interesting to me because it's more survivable is Gavin Nome because he wants to he wants to have a future and what is going to be imperative for him is what the public if he wants to run for office is going to need to look at is how well he takes your Beating one of the things that voters are very interested in they want to see how well you take it and and whether you can endure taking it and and second what he's going to have to worry about is bringing money to the state that's really the focus in terms of what the mayor can do that is that is beyond anything I can possibly comprehend how what are Gavin Newsome's odds of success at bringing money to the state already you've had the house Speaker Mike Johnson suggests that there should be conditions to any Aid that comes along and clearly uh this incoming Administration is not friendly with Gavin Newsome and vice versa no I don't think that the odds are great but the that at least he has odds the mayor has no odds there is no play there for her for him if if he can get something to the state it could work the problem he's going to have is he's going to have tension between wanting to rebuild and environmentalists who are his big constituency who don't want to rebuild and so it it it is an absolutely fraught situation and you have somebody who wants to be president who external circumstances are really going to determine it more than anything he does you think he's going to be looking at the rebuilding process and saying maybe we don't do it as much because the environmentalists help put him in the position he's in I think that that's a tension he's going to have to deal with the problem is how do you tell people who have lost their homes well we may not rebuild I I don't I don't see how there's there's a win there I mean there's no option for them other than to rebuild you can't just say well just move somewhere else that's that's that's a little bit glib and that's going to be a problem he can't dig out of more than a little glib I think and then there are the questions that come back to why the reservoir there was empty why the fire hydrants were empty he's called for an investigation how much patience will there be with that playing out just given uh the acrimony that's already built up well that's right and and no matter how much a client under attack wants to get out of the blame situation I have seen no matter what chess move they make it always comes back to who takes the fall and that is going to be the new cycle we are going to be in for a very very long time how do you think of the contrast between what Gavin Nome is doing right now and between what the governor of Florida Des santis has had done when hurricanes have devastated his State because you can look at this and say okay there are there are natural disasters acts of God things we can't control but there are human responses to these things well well there the response has been pretty different I think that that there's been greater competence in Florida I think that they're more used to it and I also think that you have a leader there who while controversial is very very camera ready in the the sense that he looks like somebody who is in absolute command uh I never really understood why George Bush got in so much trouble over Katrina because there was really only so much you can do in a natural situation like that but unfortunately what the story becomes is the handling it is always about handling they didn't handle it it was a vacuum it was a vacuum and and they didn't address it and if you let you know the chips fall where they're fall it's exactly what happened to poor W back then and you know probably should have never come out and said that Brownie's doing a heck of a job they mishandled the whole thing but you're right but I think it's still a hurricane and and and you're still dealing with an act of God there's a reason why Force majour Clauses exist because you're dealing with somebody beyond control that's why I still find it humorous when I think of the reporter asking the town official in LA in 1994 what went wrong here the the tectonic plates moved right let's talk about your new book Wise Guys and the white house uh when I first got wind of it I thought it was going to be looking back at a lot of um historic administrations that that we've kind of known around the edges whether that's FDR right uh whether that's JFK some associations with the mobsters and things that they had done along the way I think what's most interesting about this is you take this right up to the Biden and Trump administrations that this is something that's still active today what's the relationship absolutely uh organized crime and and and power well you know one of the the cliches we always hear in Washington it's not the crime it's the coverup it turns out the coverup works really well and one of the things they're coverups and one of the things I've seen in the history from from Roosevelt down to Biden is covering up organized crime connections actually has worked very well uh the Biden My Favorite Biden example is when he was running for uh Senate in 1972 uh he was behind he was a kid he was 29 years old he had a serious opponent opponent that was supposedly going to beat him an incumbent and the teamsters which were controlled by the Bruno family in Philadelphia made sure that the attack ads that were going to hit Biden on Election Eve the newspapers weren't picked up and delivered the teamsters made sure of it so that's my favorite Biden an anecdote what's interesting about Trump is Trump drives people crazy when he says when he's accused of something naughty he says that just makes me smart he's actually right because if you look at how he dealt with organized crime he did it in a way that was right on the line nobody can provably show that it was illegal and to be specific about it if you picture in Manhattan talk about in buildings in building and you you picture a building being built you picture steel Trump didn't use steel in Trump Tower he used concrete steel is an international industry concrete is controlled locally it was controlled by the geneves gambino and Columbo families he simply gave them a good concrete con contract that took care of Labor problems and a detractor would say yes but if he got something in return that's illegal my response is it's been 45 years nobody has ever proven everything and so when Donald Trump says that's what make that makes me smart as much as people cringe it's it's actually kind of true the other thing that's fascinating about Trump of all the presidents I go through he is the only one who uses organized crime is a branding thing he openly has said on television repeatedly uh yeah I had to deal with these people he said on Letterman they're very nice people but as only Trump can do if he's asked five minutes later did you deal with a mop you go no I would never do that and people are going okay I mean this is Trump uh so The Branding to use organized crime as a branding uh as a as as a patina as a whiff of who you are is unique in presidents but I go back to Roosevelt and the work with Lucky Luciano and in the Johnson Administration Waterfront protecting the water protecting the Waterfront and and Johnson when they had civil rights were you un able to to connect the dots with with Joe Kennedy and and yes Joe Kennedy was not a bootlegger and that is a very important thing to understand what about the elections about West Virginia Chicago yes but Jack Bobby and Joe were different characters Joe worked the mob to get labor support in 1960 Jack and Bobby didn't necessarily know what was more interesting is the efforts to kill Castro where Bobby Kennedy and Jack Kennedy inherited the Nixon campaigns I mean the Eisenhower administration's efforts to kill Castro and Bobby Kennedy said was Furious to hear that the mob had been been contacted and the CIA finally said Bobby you want him dead Castro but you want us to use the nicest people really is this where we are so you'll see in the book what ended up happening but they did use the mob to try to get Castro didn't work it's fascinating stuff Eric thank you Eric desen Hall the book again is called Wise Guys and the White House and we appreciate it that's the Pod for today thanks for tuning in squawkbox is

        "Beaten on the bottom line, i  should say. Shares getting a boost from the  bullish estimates. Net income coming 25% higher  than the year before. Joining me is wells fargo's cfo, michael omassimo. >> thanks for having me. >> investors appear to be  encouraging by everything from  fees to expenses. How would you characterize the  quarter? >> i think it's another great  solid quarter that we had across really most of our business  areas. I think the caps off a really  good year. Where we have been able to not  only continue to do all the  things we said we were going to  do from an efficiency point of  view but see good growth across  many of the businesses. A little bit of market share  growth in investment banking. We have seen good growth in our  credit card business and really  across the board, which is  really good to see. I think in the quarter you saw  net interest income come down a  bit as we expected but really  just about offset by higher fees across all of the businesses. A good, solid quarter. >> let's talk about that. Fees up 59%. Can that continue? >> i think you're talking about  investment banking fees. We're up substantially. And you know, that's going to  bounce around quite a bit based  on timing of activity and deals  in a quarter. You really have to look at  investment banking fees over a  slightly longer time period. But we have seen really good  growth. We started to see that market  share we expected to see as we  have been investing in the  business for 2 1/2, 3 years. >> you mentioned the net  interest income. Got that higher guide there. A lot of investors have been  waiting for that. Can you walk us through why, is  it the shape of the yield curve? can you explain it? >> yeah, it's really a little  bit of a bunch of things that  contribute to sort of the  guidance. But as we have seen throughout  2024, we have been talking about sort of the stabilization of  deposit balances and the mix of  those deposit balances. We saw rates starting to come  down and the impact that had on  deposit costs. We saw some stabilization or  stabilization of loans in some  categories. Then we did some repositioning  on the securities portfolio and  continue to get the benefit of  those higher yields there. And so it really is a little bit of across the board. We are expecting to see a little loan growth potentially, more so in the second half of the year  than the first half. We do expect to see modest  growth in deposits across our  operating businesses. We'll get the benefit of the  securities as i mentioned, and  we'll see how it goes. But i think, you know, at this  point, that's the guidance we  have got and i think it will be  hopefully a good year as we go  through the rest of the year. >> are you surprised industry  wide the degree to which credit  quality has avoided becoming a  concern? >> i'm not sure surprised is the right word, but as each quarter, we continue to see very  consistent performance. And that's helped by the fact  that the unemployment remains  very low. The economy is doing well. People have jobs. They're paying their bills. The activity levels are still  strong across the economy. So as long as that employment  picture stays strong, i think  you're going to continue to see  good performance overall across  the consumer side. And on the commercial side,  people are just using less  credit still. We haven't seen that pick up in  utilization of credit across  many of the commercial customers so they're being quite prudent  as they look, and we'll see  growth later in the year, but  that's still been the case so  that's helping credit  performance. >> the other thing we love to  touch base with you, efficiency  and technology has been a story. A.i. Eating wall street's lunch. It looks at the equity analysts  cut over the year, the project  for job cuts in financial  services in the coming years. Is that a real trend to keep an  eye on? >> i heard it might be impacting media too but i'm not sure. >> believe me. >> look, i think a.i., we have  been using traditional a.i. For  a long time. Inside wells fargo in a number  of use cases. With generative a.i., it's early to see that have a significant  impact, but it will help  initially with making ou",

        "Wildfires in los angeles. The death toll rising to at  least 25 victims now. Current estimates of damage  totaling $250 and $275 billion. Our next guest overseas, a  regional bank based in l.a. With 24 branches across california,  joining a number of growing  institutions in developing  mortgage assistance programs. Appreciate the help today. I just wonder, we have talked a  lot about california evolving  into an insurance desert of  source. What do you think are going to  be the most pressing issues once these are truly contained for  now? >> hi, carl and sara. Thanks for having me on today. I think it really has a lot to  do with rebuilding. Rebuilding in terms of the labor cost, the material cost. I think the insurance will get  there. One thing we often think about  is how do we continue to lend to our communities, our friends and family and neighbors and cliejts clients is as long as they can  rebuild a house, insurance will  be there, if not, the california fair plan will be there. We'll continue to lend into our  communities. >> they got some comments out of kb home which reported earnings. They were asked about supply  chain pressures in the area. Their argument was population is so robust in that part of the  country that there's capacity. They didn't really see that much of a crunch in the making. Do you agree? >> i don't know if i agree with  that. Kb homes is a great home  builder, but there is already a  very limited supply. We is a supply issue for  probably the last two years in  terms of the housing inventory  and this is going to continue to exasperate that situation, both  on the rental stock and the  for-sale stock. >> i love it if you can talk  about more how you're impacted. I believe 48% of your deposits  are located in l.a. County. What are you seeing from your  customers? how are you working with  borrowers and are you seeing  missed payments? >> absolutely. So we have 24 branches in  southern california. There's been no impact to the  business, to the operations. We had one or two branches that  had to close because they didn't have any power. For the most part, we're all  back to work. We had a few of our team members that had to evacuate, but in  terms of the mortgage  assistance, we're launching a  program to do more mortgage  deferment for three months and  it could go as long as 12 months if that's what the need is. We'll continue to help our  clients. So far, we have identified about maybe about 18 loans or so to  the tunes of about $15 million  in total. It's not a big number. Our total asset on the mortgage  side is about $6 billion. >> jpmorgan did a look at how  households might be financially  stretched at least in the pal  sides where they argue the  average home value is $3.5  million, but more than half of  tax returns had adjusted gross  income under $200,000. Just making the point that a lot of these households had an  unusual amount of their net  worth wrapped up in the house. >> that's right. You won't see it on the tax  returns but you'll see it on the balance sheet of the consumers. That's really what you're going  to see. As great as the vast section and the tremendous loss they have  experienced, i think that area  will get rebuilt just because of i think the balance sheet that a lot of that population has. >> so does the rebuilding  effort, is it positive for your  business? do you participate in a big way  in terms of loans? >> we'll participate in every  way we can. I'm talking to some of our  clients who are focused on kind  of just rebuilding and they have always been in the business of  rebuilding homes and we're  definitely going to participate  as part of that. It's about building back the  housing stock for l.a. So that  everybody n have a home to  live. >> on the flip side, there's  increasing chatter about people  wanting to leave l.a. Or  california because of the  problems like this, and i wonder if -- how you view the migration issue and whether it changes the economic prospects for a bank  like yours that is so heavily  concentrated there. >> we have always talked about  that. The migration is impacting the  state population in general,  impacting the business growth,  if you will. I think we will continue to see  people that want to establish  businesses and open ",

OUR NEXT GUEST EXPECTING  VOLATILITY TO BE HIGHER THAN  LAST YEAR DRIVEN BY MORE  UNCERTAINTY AROUND INFLATION AND THE FED'S RATE CUT PATH. JOINING US IS CO-HEAD OF GLOBAL  ASSET ALLOCATION, MARK ANDERSON. DOES TODAY'S INFLATION NUMBER  GIVE YOU SOME RELIEF ON THAT  FRONT? >> I THINK IT DOES. THIS WAS JUST A GREAT REPORT FOR EVERYBODY. IT WAS GREAT FOR THE EQUITY  INVESTORS OUT THERE. IT WAS GREAT FOR THE BOND  INVESTORS. WE'RE LONG U.S. EQUITIES. WE HAVE AN INCREASED POSITION  AROUND TREASURIES. IT WAS GREAT ON ALL OF THOSE  COUNTS. I THINK A LOT TO THE DISCUSSION  YOU WERE JUST HAVING, THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS OUT THERE THAT  THERE WOULD BE A PATH FOR THE  FED TO START TALKING ABOUT THE  POSSIBILITY OF HIKING INTEREST  RATES AGAIN. WITH THAT REPORT TODAY WITH CORE INFLATION JUST GETS US BACK INTO THAT FUZZY FEELING OF GOLDILOCKS SCENARIO WHERE WE CAN PRINT  NONFUND PAYROLL PAYROLL REPORTS  WITH JOB GAINS ABOVE 200,000 AND STILL HAVE INFLATION COMING IN  ON A PATH THAT THE FED WILL  CONTINUE TO BRING THEM CLOSER TO A NEUTRAL TERRITORY AND VERY  LIKELY PUT THEM IN A PLACE WHERE THEY'LL BE CUTTING INTEREST  RATE. TWO TIMES THIS YEAR IN JUNE AND  IN SEPTEMBER. >> BUT IT DOESN'T QUIET THE  QUESTIONS OVER THE INCOMING  ADMINISTRATION AND WHAT THEY  WILL MEAN FOR THE BOND MARKET,  WHICH ARE REALLY STARTING TO  HEAT UP. EVERYTHING FROM FISCAL TO  INFLATION AS IT RELATES TO  TARIFFS AND TO TIGHTER  IMMIGRATION POLICY. ON ONE HAND, WE'RE HEARING FROM  SOME OF THE BANKS ON EARNINGS  AND IT'S VERY POSITIVE FOR  CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY AND FOR THE ECONOMY. ON THE OTHER, THERE IS STILL  UNCERTAINTY. HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT BOND  IMPLICATIONS THERE? ? I THINK BOND MARKETS ARE LIKELY  TO DO RELATIVELY WELL. WE HAVE EXPECTED THE BOND CURVE  TO STEEPEN A BIT. THAT'S HOW WE HAVE POSITIONED  FOR SOME PRIVATE CLIENTS. WITH AN INCOMING ADMINISTRATION  WHERE WE'RE NOT YET SURE TO  WHICH EXTENT WE'RE GOING TO GET  TAX CUTS, WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING  TO HAPPEN ON FISCAL AND THAT  TRAJECTORY, AND WE THINK THAT  REQUIRES A BIT OF A RISK PREMIUM FOR HOLDING LONGER DATED BONDS. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING OUR ATTENTION AND OUR OVERWEIGHT POSITION IN OUR BOND PORTFOLIOS  AROUND FIVE-YEAR MARK ON U.S.  TREASURIES WHERE WE THINK THERE  IS GOOD VALUE AND WE WOULD BE  BETTER TO EXTEND DURATION MUCH  EYOND THAT FOR SOME OF THOSE  REASONS YOU MENTIONED. I THINK THE TREASURY HEAD ALSO  HAS A LARGE FOCUS IN HOW HE  OPERATES AND TALKED TO INVESTORS ABOUT THE FISCAL TRAJECTORY AND  THE RISK OF UNHINGING OF THE  LONG END OF THE CURVE. THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE  INCOMING ADMINISTRATION TO HAVE  A FOCUS ON. >> MARK, SOME OF THE HAWKS,  THOUGH, ARE STILL POINTING TO  VARIOUS COMMODITIES OF  MULTI-MONTH HIGHS, THE ISM  PRICES PAID NUMBER WE GOT A FEW  DAYS AGO. TODAY, IT'S EMPIRE  MANUFACTURING, THE SIX-MONTH  OUTLOOK FOR PRICES PAID IS AT A  TWO-YEAR HIGH. YOU WOULDN'T CALL THIS MORNING'S PRINT AN ALL CLEAR, WOULD YOU? >> NO, BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT  ABOUT THE PRINT THIS MORNING IS  WE SORT OF SEEM TO BE -- WE WERE STUCK IN OVER THE LAST FOUR  MONTHS IN A PLACE WHERE THE  MONTHLY CORE READING ON  INFLATION WAS AN 0.3% LEVEL. NOW WE HAVE A 0.2% WHICH IS THAT PACE AND CLIP WE NEED TO GET TO  GET THE FED COMFORTABLE TO KEEP  CUTTING RATES FURTHER. WHEN WE LOOK AT COMMODITY  PRICES, THEY'RE STUCK IN A  LITTLE BIT OF A SPECIAL PLACE  BECAUSE WE SEE THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PMIs  IS SORT OF SUGGESTING THAT THE  MANUFACTURING SECTORS AREN'T  DOING TOO WELL. IT SHOULD SUGGEST THAT COMMODITY PRICES SHOULD NOT BE AS  SUPPORTED AS MAYBE THEY HAVE  BEEN. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE'RE SEEING  SOME OF THE TRANSITION METALS,  THE INDUSTRIAL METALS, IF  ANYTHING THE PRECIOUS METALS  SUCH AS GOLD WHERE WE HAVE A  VERY OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK AS WELL  BE IT AROUND GOLD AND SILVER, IN ADDITION",

Everybody is up except for  consumer staples at the moment. Getting breaks news from the new york fed. President john williams speaking to usiness leaders in  connecticut. Steve liesman with the  headlines. >> thanks. John williams saying he path  for policy will be dependent on  the data but the outlook is  highly uncertain, especially for fiscal, trade, immigration, and  regulatory policy. He said inflation has gone from  high to expected. He expects the process to  continue going downward, though  the process, he says, may be  choppy. This inflation, he says, has  been broad based and lists a  number of reasons why he think  it's true. Growth and labor force and in  productivity means the economy  can expand at a faster pace. The labor market, he says, will  not be a source of inflationary  pressures. The economy in a good place and  has returned into balance. Real quickly, guys. Barkin talking in the last hour  before williams saying he  doesn't see anything in the rise in long term rates that will  influence fed policy at this  point. >> it feels like they don't know as much as the market doesn't  know. We have to see what the trump  policies are and what the impact is on the economy. >> it's interesting you say  that. To me, reading williams' remarks and knowing from the interview i did with him at the end of  december, he doesn't think the  neutral rate is much higher than before, and seeing inflation is  coming down, he would normally  be a guy that you would think  would say, okay, we can lower  rates further. But you'll notice there's no  real monetary policy forecast in there. He doesn't make it, doesn't say  it. I think you put your finger on  the reason. It's because of the uncertainty  surrounding the fiscal side of  things and tariffs and those  sorts of things. Otherwise, i think the fed",

        "Stocks are rallying across  the  board.  meanwhile european data showing  inflation quarreling in the uk.  our next guest manages various  funds including the oakmark  global fund.  the portfolio manager joins us  now.  you know, it has been rough for  international equities.  the u.s. Continues to be he  center of the action.  is there anything that you are  seeing, david, that looks like  that will change?  >> if you look at the last 10  years at the index, it's barely  up 4, 5%.  s&p 500 is up 13 or 14% but we  are getting so lopsided.  evaluation differential is  getting so large that i think  we are looking for pockets of  opportunity, where to invest.  you certainly have to consider  overseas stocks because the  fundamentals remain okay.  they are not robust or booming  but we are growing.  single digits, yet we are  pricing the earnings ratios of  the portfolios for instance just 10 times and this is 10 times  on top of the projected 10%  earnings growth so these types  of value characteristics make it almost irresistible to start  dipping your toes or growing  your international exposure.  >> accept the fundamentals --  not to pay up but a lot of  people would argue with the  fundamental plan, the lack of  growth across the economies.  the fact they have firmer  inflation numbers.  the fact they don't ave  magnificent seven, a.i.  companies, anything like that.  that is what they point two as  to why they are cheap.  maybe they should stay that  way.  >> this is not an adequate  criticism because companies  based in europe, their growth  rates are not dependent on  where their home is.  they are dependent on where  they do business.  think of some of the global  industries based in europe.  there is no u.s. Competition  for them.  goods in particular.  you could look at other  industries such as  pharmaceutical.  strong pharma sector in europe.  so what does the separate?  company growth and company  fundamentals from what's  happening in the various macro  economies where they are  located.  this misnomer, this  imperfection allows a bona fide  long-term investor an  opportunity to make money.  and separately, not all of  europe is germany.  go ahead.  >> my question was about  germany.  any number of industrial  companies in that country, are  there opportunities there?  i know they are trading at  incredibly low multiples.  is it actually concerning?  >> first of all, the german  economy is concerning.  thankfully there will be an  election in the next month.  hopefully we have better, free  market policies that get  instituted because germany is  once again the sick man of  europe. There are other places  in europe doing very well.  spain, italy, portugal, et  cetera.  but germany, the biggest economy is on its back.  to the extent at which german  companies have to pay high  energy prices, we do have to  factor this in to how we value  the business as.  but luckily, again, you think  of a company that does business  all over the world's.  you know, process software.  industrial process software,  factory automation.  it does business all over the  world and you look at these  companies, even the car  companies incidentally like  mercedes and bmw.  only a third of their business  comes from europe in general  where as the other third comes  from asia and the u.s. So this  is an opportunity.  investors get scared off by  german policy in particular.  by the way, the uk sadly is not  learning from germany's  mistakes.  this is bad for the uk economy.  wh",

Stocks are  rallying on the back of this  latest inflation print.  the bank numbers are coming in  strong but when it comes to  inflation, not entirely clear  cut when it comes to investors.  steve liesman is here with  more.  steve, does this change  anything?  >> immediately.  sara, it is not going to be   clearcut for the fed either .  the numbers as you reported are  better than expected but it's  not a green light for the fed  to cut rates anytime soon.  let's go through the numbers.  0.4%, worse than the prior month on the headline number but what  everyone is watching, that came  in better than the prior month  and better than expectations.  year-over-year, 2.9%.  that's not good for the fed.  the court, 3.2%.  not good enough for the fed.  housing seems to be helping.  at least not getting worse.  it's up 0.3%.  airfares, that number is  expected to be temporary.  core services, 0.2%.  goods, well-behaved despite the  fact new cars were up.  clothing was well behaved as  well.  taking a look at the early  forecasters, they have their  numbers and they come up with  the fed's preferred indicator  that comes at the end of the  month and it is expected to be  well-behaved around 0.13 to 0.18 , roughly unchanged from  november but if you look at the  three to six month gauges if  that is the way to come.  we see the fed moving to the  sidelines for the first half of  the year to assess the evolving  economic, inflation, and policy  landscape.  that is where the market is  when you look at the  probabilities they are higher  but not 50% for may.  66 or two-thirds for jim.  hopefully this is the answer to  sara's  question on confidence.  most believe the fed will be on  hold.  why?  fiscal policy and being unsure  about inflatio",

        "98.5, something like that.  98 on 9, that is after a big  day yesterday.  >> more on how the fed is  likely to view this years  inflation, former vice  chairman, as well as cnbc  contributor . Let's do it this  way, let's say, you happen to  get a phone call from j. Powell  right now and he says, did you  see the cpi numbers, what do  you think i should do about  that?  >> look, a funny way to ask the  question.  look, i think the fed is  looking for trends.  the market is excited to move  one way or the other.  the truth of the matter is,  underneath all of this, the  economy is strong, the labor  market remains strong, and  inflation, if it moves to the  2%, it is moving glacially.  i think the answer is, you  stand at the next meeting, wait  for more information to get a  clearer view, and obviously,  fiscal policy will come into  play as well.  my view is, this is not change  anything, stay where you wear  with no expectation of moving  at the next meeting, and we  will see what happens after  that.  >> are you surprised at the  market's reaction thus far?  and i think it is fair to say,  the market is rallying on this  news pretty much across the  board, and you have this  interesting sort of risk on, or  i don't know what we are  deciding with this bitcoin  situation, as a symbol of  barometer or something moving  materially higher as we are  speaking.  the dow up 670 points, roger.  >> look, i think the market is  getting very sort of data point  dependent, and every time it is  slightly good news they take  that as an excuse to rally. As  we saw yesterday, the initial  reaction is strong, and that  sort of faith the reality of  the trend sets in. I am not  totally surprised we are seeing  initial, strong reaction but we  will watch the rest of the day,  but i think the market overall  is missing the big trend, which  is, the fed is in no hurry to  cut.  don't think they are  ready to raise, either.  inflation is moving sideways.  and i think fed policy for a  period of time will be moving  sort of sideways with the fed  funds rate.  >> why is the market missing  that?  you have been saying it, others  have been saying it.  >> i don't the market now goes  up when it thinks it is going  to get a rate cut.  i don't think that has changed.  i think the market was just  worried about inflation going  back up. If it can sort of stay  where it is, i think that is  very bullish for the market,  even if we don't get any cuts,  as long as we don't get any  hikes this year.  >> i think that is a fair  point.  this may be to some degree a  bit of a relief rally. There  may have been an expectation,  despite ppi, things, assuming  that proves not to be the case,  a little wiping the brow,  continuing to move forward. The  other thing we should  recognize, the market is right,  the economy is doing pretty  well, very well.  we saw a bunch of bank reports  this morning, all of which i  think were indications of a  strong, underlying economy.  there is something else going  on here in addition to a little  relief rally around inflation,  there is a sense that the  economy is actually healthy,  and maybe people holding their  singers, or crossing their  fingers the fiscal policy, the  incoming administration will  not mess things up too much and  we could have a pretty good  year.  >> roger, i don't know if you  are listening to the earlier  conversation we were having  with steve liesman, and decided  that maybe at some point, you  think the fed actually shifts  from 2%, or talks about it in a  more range way then to present  on the big goal i should say,  the target?  >> i understand your question.  i think the economic logic  would be, let'think about  this as a range. I was never in  favor of an explicit, 2%  target, because it is very hard  to hit, such an estimate that  is so imperfectly hard to  measure and hard to manage.  economically, the range would  be smart.  i think the issue is  credibility.  moving from, we believe in 2%,  we believe in 2%, to suddenly  now, we have opened up the  range, people will scratch  their heads and say, if the  range was 1 1/2 to 2 1/2, why  is the range 3? i think they  are in a bind, where logically,  theoretically, they should go  for a range i think it kind of  makes it very hard to move away  from this pinpoint estimate.  >> roger, real quick, do you  think this is aj.  powell issue, meaning, down the  line, if he ultimately was  replaced-- i say down the line,  but when somebody else comes  into that seat, they can  establish a range if they want  without the credibility issues  you are describing?  >> i think it is an  institutional issue.  the 2% got built-in, it has  been there with janet, now with  j.

        "Year-over-year was still  sticky, well over 12%.  same may be true today. We want  to pay very close attention to  year-over-year on retail  inflation.  and here we go, consumer price  index for december comes out  4/10 of the headline, exactly  as expected!  to find a higher number than  4/10, you are going all the way  back to august of 2023, when it  was up half of 1%.  strip out the all-important  food and energy, up to tens,  one sent cooler than we  expected.  one intent cooler than the  rearview mirror.  up to tens, how does that come?  we equal july of 24, to find a  lower number, you go back to  june of '24.  here we go, on the headline  year-over-year, up 2.9, as  expected.  how much more as expected?  the fact that it is 2/10 higher  than our last look, which was  2.7 peer to have a number  higher, you are going june of  last year.  finally, on the year-over-year  core, it is 3.2%, 1/10 lighter  than the rearview mirror,  lighter than expectations.  but, 3.2 is a little bit of  progress, it equals where we  were in august.  that equals august to find a  lower number, you are going in  the way back machine.  you have to find a 3% number,  that is all the way back in  april of '21.  many don't look at the indices,  i look at the indices.  this really says it all.  if you look at the cpi index,  started 10 1913, it is now  315.6.05, that is the second  highest number ever, the highest , the record was october '24.  if you look at this, and much  every month we make new, all- time highs. It is nice we pull  back just a smidge. If we look  at the year-over-year, excuse  me, core going all the way back  to 1957, 323.8, that is an new  all-time high and what does  that tell me?  we can look at these numbers  based on expectations, like we  do, but the reality is, even  yesterday, if you look at some  of the smaller month over month  numbers, it means the inflation  rate is growing more slowly it  is not growing in reverse, that  is what these indices tell us  that virtually anybody watching  that is an economist, they feel  the pressure of rising prices,  and it is a pressure that very  much never seems to ease off.  we don't normally see a lot of  negative numbers.  speaking of negative numbers,  there is one i haven't pointed  out yet, empire is also out.  january number kind of real- time, minus 12.6, minus 12.6,  for the week going back to  minus 15 in change of may last  year.  we still see manufacturing is a  bit curtailed.  interest rates, moving  significantly lower here.  significantly lower.  maybe it was the month over  month core.  maybe it was the fact we came  in as or a little light on  expectations of what the market  prepared for.  like yesterday, we want to  watch the secondary and  tertiary responses as we get  closer to the opening of  equities.  it may be a very short-lived  rally pushing yields down.  i want to point out we have  traded slightly on a basis  above 480 and a 10.  we touched 5% yesterday briefly  and 830.

        ">>> welcome back to \"squawk box .\"  >>> blackrock beat estimates on  the top and bottom line,  decisively.  in an exclusive interview, i  asked the ceo where he thinks  we are in the market right now.  >> i think i said last quarter,  i see the scenario where the  bottom will be 9%.  i can actually see a scenario  where the tenure is at five and  at present, i can also see  where it is going back to 4%.  and so, we have an incoming  president, who was making broad  changes to the economy, broad  decisions, and we will see how  this all plays out, and it all  comes down to inflation.  there are some economists who  are calling for the fed  continuing to ease three or  four times, and some people  say, they will stop.  i heard from one or two  economists, they will have to  start raising it again.  i don't know truly where we  are, but i could say the range  of outcomes is broader than he  range of options we just saw  four months ago, and i think  that is what is going on in the  markets.  >> asked what is going on in  the markets in terms of that  range?  >> 5 1/2% with the harmful for  growth equity. That is what you  are starting to see.  that being said, we will see a  lot of reports this morning  related to earnings.  we will have earnings the next  few weeks.  my bet, earnings will be  stronger overall.  that being said, we cannot  discount, and this is something  people are not focusing on, the  strength of the u.s. Dollar.  let dissect in my earnings  announcement, i will talk about  blackrock.  we had to a $81 billion in net  influx also, because of the  dollar appreciation, we had a  $200 billion evaluation,  because of our appreciation.  that will play a big role in  earnings in the fourth quarter,  and we will see how these  multinational companies will be  playing it.  beyond the reevaluation of the  dollar that you can't control,  i do think earnings will be  stronger than what people  think, because they believe the  resiliency of the u.s. Economy.  and i think the economy is in  very good shape. That being  said, is it in too good of a  shape?  are we going to start seeing  elevated inflationary measures?  we will know that probably by  march.  the range is broader.  >> i also spoke with larry fink  about  wokism the politics of  the moment, especially as they  relate to investing.  they left a climate group  called the asset managers  initiative and blackrock is  somewhat of a symbol for  principles and a target for  those that see the initiatives  of having gone too far.  it didn't seem like investors  were punishing the company for  any of those negative  perceptions that may be out  there, given the amount of  inflows that are coming,  specifically in the united  states, frankly from red states  to blackrock. >> actually, we are getting  more checks.  there is no question, we were a  topic of debate from the far  left and far right. I think  what is resonating, our job is  we are a fiduciary for every  one client.  if a client awarded us $1000,  if a client ordered us $10  billion, our job is to do what  is right for them.  a lot of members of the far  left, a lot of members of the  far right would like to tell me  how to manage their money.  what we are telling everybody  is, our job is to manage your  money your way.  it is not our money.  all $11.6 trilliant we are  responsible for, are our money.  what it shows is, we are doing  a very good job of helping each  and every one of our clients to  do asset management the way  they want s to do it.  yes, there are-- could we want  more business, if we were not a  part of a topical debate, yes,  we probably would have won  more.  that being said, we never had a  year like last year in the  united states.  >> you think this is that  debate?  >> no, by no means.  we are responsible for a lot of  people's money. We are a large  shareholder listed on behalf of  a lot of companies. No.  scale and size in every industry , you become a target. That is  just a part of life in a world  that is heavily oriented toward  populism. Our job is to be  persistent in working with each  and every client. Our job is  not to be working for the left- wing organization or right-wing  organization, or the  spokesperson from the far right  or left.  our job is to work for each and  every client and that is  resonating with our clients.  >> real quick on that issue,  will you speak to the idea of  taking yourself out of the net  zero absorption?  >> was i a part of the  conversation internally, or  what?  well, so many things have  become politicized. We are  responsible now in  decarbonization, and the whole  investing in new technologies  for energy, we are the largest  manager in the world in that.  we are getting more business  than ever before in terms of  decarbonization technology.  we have over $1 trillion we are  responsible for.  those clients who are  interested in the tech  technologies, new issues, new  things, they a coming to us.  at the same time, we are the  largest hydrocarbon investor in  the world, we always were.  it has been contorted by many  people.  today, it is i think $181  billion we manage from carbon  co",

        "Were in line.  though shares up about 2.7% in  market, guys.  >> very good, leslie, thanks  for that.  let's get back to, founder and  ceo of intelligence of alpha. I  guess it begs the question, how  do we add in the promise of  quantum computing, and layer it  on to a.i. , and what does it mean for the  tech group, and even the tech  leaders, the mag6, if we don't  use tesla?  although, that is a tech stock  too.  >> the way we are applying it,  at least, it will refocus a lot  of a.i.  on a.i.  companies, i think it is the  moment.  for the next two to four years,  all of these companies will be  driven by what they do in the  a.i.  space and how they actually  generate revenue from a.i.  quantum, i think, is fun  optimality, but we will not see  anything tangible in the next  two to four years.  it is a good story, but i think  we need to rely on a.i.  products or revenues if you are  making investments in the tech  space right now.  >> to summarize maybe how you  are feeling, or encapsulate how  you are feeling some of the  tech trade, while some think it  is dead, if you assume multiples holdup at 28, these are still  fast-growing companies. You  theoretically could just add  the earnings growth and layer  that on to the stock price, and  that would be probably what, 18  to 20% growth this year in the  mag 7.  >> that is right.  a conversation we have been  having more, a saying that  markets are meant to frustrate  the most participants possible  by doing what no one expects.  exactly.  and i think the consensus  coming into 2025 was me this is  the year of broadening come of  the year where big tech slows  down, and we are sort of  asking, what if it is not?  you go back to '23 expectations  were for recessions, '24,  expectations were for small  caps to win.  what if in 25 we get steady  earnings for mag 6, and you do  have stocks growing high  teens , probably, that is a pretty  high stock for the markets to  keep up with.  >> and there will be some fomo,  i can feel it already.  think of larger numbers, it is  hard to imagine stocks that are  two, three, four market caps.  a lot of times stocks hitting  new lows hit new lows, stocks  hitting more highs hit more  highs, i have seen that.  >> they do.  i think the fundamentals in the  cases of these mag  6 companies  are so strong.  they do support large  enterprise values.  at 28 times multiple, sort of  in the range in the last 10  years, it is roughly in the  middle.  it is not a crazy multiple, but  healthy. Big numbers, large  numbers, a lot of  concentration, but they provide  a lot of the earnings as well.  we talk about 30 plus percent  for concentration and we have  to look at how much of the  earnings the",

        "Toonist thomas nast, in an  illustration for harper's  weekly.  >>> welcome back to \"squawk  box,\" blackrock, now overseeing  $11.6 trillion. That's with a t. Under management. Beating on the top and bottom  lines. I spoke to blackrock chairman  and ceo larry fink in an  exclusive interview and asked  him about the alternatives  business, which is a big new  priority for the firm.  >> it is my belief for  democratic economies to continue to grow and western economies to continue to grow, we're going to have to rely more on the private sector, and the brilliance of  the united states economy is  based on the capital markets. That's a role to talk about the  role in the capital markets. We have the broadest, deepest  capital markets in the world. A start up company, a medium  company, large company has  access to capital like nowhere  else in the world, and we  underestimate the power of our  global capital markets. It is my belief that capital  markets are going to become a  larger and larger economic  engine in the united states and  all throughout the world. I said in the editorial we can't rely on deficits. We don't talk enough about our  deficits right now, and i do  believe we're going to have to  rely more on the private  capital, private sector. That's what president trump is  talking about in some of the new policies. We'll see how that rolls out. If i had a crystal ball, i would tell you right now that the  sectors that are going to grow  the most in the capital markets  and the private space will be  infrastructure. >> one year ago, just this week, we should mention, blackrock  announced the acquisition of  gip, that deal closed in  october, they have since  announced more deals. I asked fink, what is next on  his wish list. >> i mean, i would tell you --  >> are there other things, you  say to yourself we would like to be in? >> actually, in 2023, we called  it our 2030 strategy, we said we need to get much larger in  private market data. We said we need to get much  larger infrastructure. We had a growing infrastructure  team. We were doing well in it. We're not growing as fast as the perceived market. We had one target. That was gip, and we said in the strategy session in 2023, we  need to get much larger in  private credit, and we had only  one target, hbs, and the beauty  of last year is we only had  three targets and acquired all  three new targets. I don't have any new targets. We may do some minority  investments, but we're not going to be -- i don't believe you'll  see blackrock in the market  buying whole companies.  >> also this morning, black rock announcing one of its top  executives, mark wheaton who  spent more than two decades at  the firm departing. He is the head of global client  business and was considered a  potential successor to fink. I asked him what the  announcement means for  succession plans at the firm.  >> mark is a dear friend. He will remain a dear friend. He is a really true dear friend  of mine. Mark came to me six months ago  talking about what ifs and all  that stuff. He's been at the firm 20 years,  and he said, you know what, i'm  looking for a new chapter. And over time -- he wasn't  decisive back then, but as we  talked and talked and talked, it was very clear that he was going to go down a new path. I don't believe we have ever had a deeper, broader bench at this  firm ever, and so i'm actually  smiling about the ease in which  a serious leader of blackrock  chooses a new direction in his  life that i had many options. And, you know, we worked with  the board, with the management  team, and this has been a --  it's really a moment of joy not  that mark is leaving, but he's  leaving with a hug and he's  leaving with a lot of grace. There's a beautiful memo that's  going to be out this morning  about mark and all that, and  what he meant ",

PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT AM  TERNTIVES AND ANOTHER BIG YEAR  FOR PRIVATE CREDIT.  BUT LOAN CONDITIONS.  GROWTH IS GOING TO BE ANEMIC.  CREDIT CONDITIONS GENERALLY  BEEN PRETTY GOOD.  THE ECONOMY IS VERY GOOD.  ' WHY DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE  ARE GOING TO GO TO PRIVATE  CREDIT AND PRIVATE EQUITY?  >> THE OF COURSE THE BANKS  STRUCTURALLY BECAUSE OF A LOT  OF REGULATION ARE -- MOVING  CREDIT OFF THEIR BOOKS.  AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S -- THE  PRIVATE CREDIT PROVIDERS ARE  THERE TO PICK UP SLACK  ESSENTIALLY.  SO, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE SEEING  CONTINUED GROWTH IN THAT AREA.  OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TRADITIONAL  ASSET MANAGERS BUYING PRIVATE  CREDIT FIRMS AS WELL.  SO THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE.  >> ALL RIGHT.  LAST QUESTION.  WE HAD A GUEST ON EARLIER,  FORECASTING THREE FED RATE CUTS  THIS YEAR.  WE HAD OTHER PEOPLE SAYING  MAYBE TWO.  THE FORECAST, THE CONSENSUS IS  JUST ONE, WHERE DO YOU STAND  AND HOW DOES THAT IMPACT THE  MARKET GOING FORWARD?  >> YEAH, THINK I'M IN THE --  GENERALLY IN THE HIGHER FOR  LONGER CASE.  STICKY INFLATION PROBABLY ONE  CUT ALONG WITH CONSENSUS AND I  THINK THAT'S A GOOD SITUATION.  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TENSION  ONGOING THIS YEAR BETWEEN THE  DEREGULATION AND DOJE AND ON  ONE SIDE AND TARIFFS AND TAX  CUTS ON THE OT",

        "A cnbc contributor.  alex, good morning.  good to see you.  happy new year.  >> good morning frank.  happy new year.  >> all right, so i want to get  your broad take on that last  comment.  the intense year by mark  zuckerberg.  when mark zuckerberg says that,  what does he mean in your mind?  >> i think he means that these  big tech companies were seen as  country clubs and right before  2022, lots of perks and really  tough to get fired and even in  the memo himself, zuckerberg  said we were not going to fire  low -- poor performers in the  past and manage them out.  i think what he's saying with a  intense year is he wants to  bring back the year of the  feeling of efficiency, 2023 and  2022 where employees were off- balance because they were  laying off a lot of people and  cutting back on perks and they  worked really hard and i think  trying to keep that start-up  level culture within the  company.  and move past the country club  mentality that they might have  had for a couple of years.  and that's where he's focusing  the company.  >> all right.  so trying to get out of that  quote unquote what you call a  country club mentality.  how to view this with the work  force reductions for both  microsoft and meta?  at the same time, they're  expected to boost their cap  backs.  how should we view that, you  know, as investors and people  that are watching this company?  >> well, for meta i think it's  important to say that they're  back filling those 5% of  positions that they're cutting  or planning to cut.  right?  it's actually not work force  reduction at all.  just going to hire in the place  of those employees that they  let go.  with microsoft, you know, i do  know that they're doing some  cuts there.  but they're tying it to  artificial intelligence and i  think the way that you have to  look at this.  we're cutting to make room for  artificial intelligence, they  are basically taking a negative  moment for the company where  they have to lay off and  they're trying to spinette as a  positive making room for  artificial intelligence.  for meta again i think maybe  some positioning but small  cuts, very small cuts within  microsoft and to me that sounds  more like spin than reality.  >> all right.  when we look at tech companies,  it seems like seasonally we see  layoffs and work force  reductions and i know you are  saying one of them is not  actually a work force reduction  but seasonally we seem to see  these in the beginning of the  year.  the two companies, these are  expected to be big years.  where really trying to scale up  the ai technology and  capitalize on it.  growth.  so do we generally see tech  companies looking to cut costs  while trying to actively grow  at the same time?  just cultural for silicon  valley.  is this normal?  >> it's not normal.  you don't really see the  companies doing lieoffs and in  fact they really started in  2022 and made unprecedented  cuts then during, you know,  facebook branded it the year of  efficiency but every other  company had their own nickname  for it and they made cuts and  amazon made much bigger cuts  than meta did but i think the  notion of cutting costs is a  myth right now within big tech.  you might find pockets here and  there but ultimately they're  all surging forward and ai  development and ai development  is expensive.  you need a ton of compute and  you need the best employees  possible and you need a ton of  power.  right?  so when you are building  nuclear power plants or you are  thinking about building nuclear  level power plants or leasing  power off of them, you are not  really in a position to say  we're really going to take down  cap bets.  it's going to be a big year of  spending f",

        "GOOD MORNING.  GOOD TO SEE YOU.  >> GOOD MORNING FRANK.  >> ALL RIGHT.  SO BIG WEEK FOR EARNINGS AND  OBVIOUSLY THE BIG BANKS KICK IT  OFF.  WHAT'S YOUR TOP PICK IN THE  SPACE AND WHAT WILL THIS REPORT  TELL YOU IN YOUR MIND ABOUT THE  REST OF THE EARNINGS SEASON  WHEN IT COMES TO BIG  THE TOP OF THE HEAP HERE.  YOU KNOW, TOP LEAD TABLE AND  PROBABLY GOING TO DO WELL  ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE CAPITAL  MARKETS.  WHETHER THAT'S M&A ACTIVITY,  IPO ACTIVITY, DEBT UNDERWRITING  ET CETERA.  ALSO, YOU KNOW,  IN THE LENDING SPACE.  RIGHT, CREDIT CARDS AND  DOMESTIC AND THEY'RE EXPANDING  INTERNATIONALLY.  THEY'RE EXPANDING IN --  DOMESTICALLY IN TERMS OF BRANCH  OFFICES SO YOU KNOW, PRETTY  GOOD STORY TO TELL THERE AND I  THINK THAT'S THE -- WHAT WE'RE  LOOKING FOR ACROSS THE BOARD  FROM BANKS IS, YOU KNOW,  KIND OF ANEMIC LOAN GROWTH AND  LOW SINGLE DIGITS AND I THINK  THAT BEGINS TO IMPROVE IN 2025.  WE HAVE A LOWER PRIME RATE AND  STILL EXPECT SOME RATE  REDUCTIONS IN THE BACK HALF OF  THE YEAR  ON FUNDING COSTS AND WE HAVE  STEEPENING OF THE CARD RECENTLY  WITH THE TEN YEAR MOVING  HIGHER.  IT COULD BE BENEFICIAL.  >> LOAN GROWTH.  YOU SAY THAT'S GOING TO BE  ANEMIC GOING FORWARD OR AT  LEAST THE ENVIRONMENT IS PRETTY  ANEMIC RIGHT NOW.  IS JPMORGAN THE EXCEPTION TO  THAT OR ARE ALL THE  IMPACTED BY WHAT YOU ALL ANEMIC  LOAN GROWTH?  >> JPMORGAN HAPPENS TO HAVE A  LARGE PORTION OF CREDIT CARDS  AND CREDIT CARDS HAVE BEEN A  GROWTH AREA IN TERMS OF LENDING  SO THAT WILL BE BENEFICIAL.  BANKS ARE  A BIT IN TERMS OF COMMERCIAL  LENDING AND WHETHER IT'S A  COURSE OF REAL ESTATE OBVIOUSLY  HAS IT OWN PROBLEMS AND  HOUSING.  CLEARLY MORTGAGE ACTIVITY HAS  BEEN LOW.  SO IF YOUR BASE OF BUSINESS IS  MORE SKEWED TOWARDS  HAVE -- YOU WILL HAVE LOWER  LOAN GROWTH THAN THE BANKS WITH  THE BETTER MIX.  >> WHICH BANKS WOULD BE THE  ONES YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT  HAVE A BETTER MIX?  WHICH BANKS OUT OF THE ONES  WE'RE  CITIGROUP.  THAT IS WHERE WE EXPECT THE  BETTER LOAN GROWTH NUMBERS.  >> THE STEEPENING OF THE YIELD  CURVE.  THAT'S SUPPOSED TO JUST CREATE  A BETTER SITUATION WHEN IT  COMES TO NET INTEREST INCOME  WHICH IS HOW YOU KNOW A LOT OF  THE BANKS MA MAKE A LOT OF  THEIR MONEY OR A SIGNIFICANT  PORTION OF REVENUES.  IN YOUR MIND AS WE LOOK AHEAD,  WE  BE INFLATIONARY AND WE'VE SEEN  A LOT OF ACTION IN THE BOND  MARKET.  HOW DOES THAT IMPACT THE BIG  BANKS GOING FORWARD?  AND WELL, LOOK, INTEREST RATES  ARE ALWAYS A --  >> YOU KNOW, TALE OF TWO  STORIES FOR BANKS AND RISING  YIELDS WILL TEND TO CRIMP LOAN  GROWTH.  BUT AT THE SAME  THE VALUE OF BOND PORTFOLIOS  BUT AT THE SAME TIME,  YOU KNOW, THERE ARE OTHER  OFFSETS AND A STEEPER YIELD  CURVE WILL HELP MARGINS AND  BANKS NOT TO A LARGE EXTENT BUT  THEY BORROW SHORT AND LEND LONG  AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE YIELD  CURVE.  SO THAT'S --  BENEFICIAL FOR BANKS.  IF THE ECONOMY IS STRONG, AND  THEY CAN POWER THROUGH THAT  LOAN GROWTH CONTINUES TO  IMPROVE, THAT'S REALLY THE BEST  OF BOTH WORLDS.  SO RATES ALWAYS HAVE BEEN A  DOUBLE EDGED SWORD FOR BANKS.  GREAT HEDGING IS THE NAME OF  THE GAME AND HOW  RIGHT.  SOW MENTIONED THE IPO  ENVIRONMENT AS WELL.  BEFORE YOU CAME ON WE HAD THE  FIRST AI IPO OF THE YEAR, IT  DEBUTED AND FINISHED FLAT  YESTERDAY BUT MOVING HIGH IN  THE PREMARKET.  THIS START AND SOME OF THE  OTHER THINGS IN THE PIPELINE.  HOW DO THE  2025 OR MORE OF A 2026 STORY?  >> WELL, THE -- THE FLY WHEEL  TAKES A WHILE TO OBVIOUSLY GET  STARTED AND WE'VE HAD A TWO  YEAR LULL TWO PLUS YEAR LULL  REALLY IN IPO ACTIVITY FOR  BANKS.  SO I THINK  IS SOME MORE CONSTRUCTIVE  CONVERSATIONS.  INITIAL CONVERSATIONS GOING ON  THAT THE IPO PIPELINE IS  BEGINNING TO BUILD.  TYPICALLY, AT THIS POINT, YEAH,  YOU HAVE HAD, YOU KNOW, A LONG  ENOUGH LULL PERIOD  AND YOU HAVE GOT GOOD CAPITAL  FORMATION AND A LOT OF CASH ON  THE SIDELINES.  AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SOME OF  THESE IPOs COME OUT AND DO  WELL, THAT TENDS TO START THAT  FLY WHEEL EFFECT AND MORE  COMPANIES WILL COME TO MARKET. ",

        "In at 3.3%.  for much more insight let's  bring in michelle gerard.  >> good morning frank.  >> do you think energy, do you  think that's going to be a big  factor in the read?  >> well, we do have energy  adding to the overall cpi.  so we've got an overall gain of  0.3% and if you strip out  energy which we think will be  up about 1.5%, and slightly  higher food prices, you get  down to that core rate  excluding food and energy.  and there we're really kind of  on the cusp.  we've got 0.2%.  slightly less than the overall  but honestly it's right on the  cusp between a 0.3% 0.2%.  the last three months we've  been seeing gains of 0.3%.  in the core inflation rate it  would be a bit of anime  private.  >> the keyword was a bit of an  improvement.  to get back down to 2%.  i want to ask you how much is  really riding on this cpi  report with the fed meeting  coming up in two weeks and does  this cpi report, influence just  this january meeting or do you  think it impacts the rest of  the year?  >> you know, frank, i think  it's actually less about  january especially in the wake  of that very strong employment  report on friday.  i don't think anybody is  looking for the fed to  realistically consider cutting  interest rates in january.  but what it will impact is as  you were saying these  expectations for the fed over  the course of 2025.  i mean, right now, the market  is really reduced its  expectations for further rate  cuts and it doesn't even have a  full rate cut priced in until  october.  to give you a sense of how  farexpectations for rate cuts  have been pushed off given the  strength of the data.  so the one thing that you could  see is if the numbers are  strong, like if -- if we get  our forecast i think the  markets might settle after a  lot of volatility last, you  know, several days and the wake  of that employment report.  nervousness about the fed  pushing the the yields higher  but if we -- that might settle  with a benign inflation report.  on the other hand, a high  reading on top of this market  jitters, you could get people  pricing out fed cuts for the  entire year.  you know, on a disappointing  higher than expected kpi.  >> the guest thought we might  see three rate cuts.  we do have to keep going.  bun last question -- okay.  >> you go.  just going to say, i mean, we  still got two rate cuts  ourselves although even that's  quite tentative.  honestly fraction if you get an  unexpectedly high number you  coul",

        "HEADLINE FIGURE EXPECTED TO SHOW A 2.9% JUMP FROM A YEAR AGO, UP  SLIGHTLY FROM LAST MONTH'S  READING. >>> WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT  RESULTS FROM JPMORGAN AND WELLS  FARGO. AND WE'RE AWAITING GOLDMAN SACHS AND CITIGROUP. JOINING US NOW, STEPHANIE LINK,  CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT  HIGHTOWER ADVISERS AND A CNBC  CONTRIBUTOR. YOU'VE OWN THE SOME OF THESE  NAMES IN THE PAST, STEPHANIE. GIVE US THE SNAPSHOT OF AT THIS  POINT IN TIME, FROM WHAT YOU  KNOW SO FAR FROM WHO'S  REPORTING. REPORTED.  >> YEAH, SO FAR SO GOOD, RIGHT? I THINK THE BIG THEME ON THE  POSITIVE SIDE FOR THE QUARTER  FOR ALL THE BIG BANKS IS GOING  TO BE FEE GROWTH, AND THIS IS  EXACTLY WHAT WE SAW FROM  JPMORGAN AND WARG WELLS FARGO,  UP 59%, THESE ARE HUGE NUMBERS,  AND LAST QUARTERS, VERY BIG FEES AS A SURPRISE TO THE UP SIDE. YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE  EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS FROM 40  TO 60, 70%. BANK OF AMERICA IS GOING TO POST A 70% NUMBER. INVESTMENT BANKING, 30% ON  AVERAGE, AND EQUITY AND TRADING  IN THE TEENS. THAT'S THE POSITIVE. ALSO POSITIVES, M&A. REMEMBER LAST YEAR, WE DID  $3.3 TRILLION IN GLOBAL M&A. LARRY FINK JUST TALKED ABOUT IT, RIGHT, SO WE ARE GOING TO SEE A  TAIL WIND THIS YEAR FROM THE  MOMENTUM LAST YEAR. BUT IT SHOULD IMPROVE UNDER THE  TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. BY THE WAY, IT'S JANUARY 15th,  JOE, AND WE'VE ALREADY DONE  $100 BILLION IN GLOBAL M&A. THOSE TWO WILL BE REAL  POSITIVES. LONG GROWTH IS NOT GOING TO BE  SO GREAT. LOW SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE GROUP  ON AVERAGE, AND NET INCOME  INCOME AND NET INCOME MARGINS  WILL NOT BE GREAT, BUT WE HAVE  WELLS FARGO RAISING THE NET  INCOME GUIDE, AND THAT'S THE  REAL ICING ON THE CAKE. WE HAVEN'T SEEN NET INCOME  GROWTH IN A VERY LONG TIME, AND  THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH  THE YIELD CURVE. BY THE WAY, BANK OF NEW YORK  MELON REPORTED NET INCOME  INTEREST THAT WAS BETTER, AND  NET INCOME MARGINS THAT WERE  MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED. STOCKS ARE STILL CHEAP. WAIT UNTIL WE GET BASILL 3, THE  END GAME, NOT BEING AS  RESTRICTIVE, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE BUYBACKS AS WELL. I THINK THESE STOCKS ARE STILL A BUY. >> IT'S KIND OF WEIRD,  STEPHANIE, WE UNDERSTAND HOW  SOME OF THIS STUFF WORKS WITH  THE STOCK MARKET, LIKE THE BANKS AND THE TRUMP TRADE, SO A THE  LOT -- A LOT OF STOCKS MOVED AND THE INAUGURATION IS NOT UNTIL  JANUARY 20th. WE UNDERSTAND HOW STOCKS CAN  MOVE IN ADVANCE OF WHAT THEY  THINK ARE GOING TO BE SOME TAIL  WINDS, BUT WHY DO THE NUMBER  ALREADY, THE PAST THREE MONTHS,  WHY DO THE NUMBERS SEEM TO  REFLECT BETTER OPERATING  CONDITIONS? >> WELL, I THINK A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH, JOE, WE'RE GROWING  AT ABOUT 3% IN THE ECONOMY. SO THERE IS A LOT OF UNDERLYING  MOMENTUM IN THE ECONOMY THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS  INHERITING. AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE AND CEOs AND THE EXECUTIVE BENCHES AT A  LOT OF THESE COMPANIES ARE  STARTING TO FEEL BETTER, ON TOP  OF THE ACTIVITY ALREADY BEING  STRONG. AND THESE COMPANIES HAVE DONE AN AMAZING JOB IN TERMS OF EXPENSE  CONTROL. SO THAT'S BEEN THE STORY FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. IT HASN'T REALLY BEEN THE TOP  LINE SO MUCH AS IT'S BEEN THE  EXPENSE, AND KIND OF KEEPING  THINGS IN ORDER AND IN CHECK  UNTIL WE COULD SEE BETTER  ACTIVITY. AND SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY AT  THE END OF THE DAY, THE ECONOMY  IS DRIVING THE ACTIVITY, AND  WE'RE GOING TO SEE A  CONTINUATION OF THAT UNDER THE  TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND HIS  POLICIES.  >> MAYBE NOT JUST THE  CONTINUATION, BUT SOME OF THE  OTHER STUFF, IF THEY'VE GOTTEN  THEIR, YOU KNOW, THE EXPENSE  LINE.  >> YEAH. >> UNDER CONTROL AND IN ORDER,  AND THEN YOU DO SEE M&A PICK UP  AND WHATEVER OTHER THINGS YOU  THINK OF WITH DEREGULATION,  WHATEVER YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN,  THEY COULD BE TOTALLY LEVERAGED, AND THIS COULD BE THE BEGINNING  OF EVEN BETTER NUMBERS LIKE THE  NEXT QUARTER, YOU COULD EVEN SEE BETTER NUMBERS.  >> 100%. THAT'S WHY I MENTIONED, NET  INTEREST INCOME, THAT'S WHAT I'M WATCHING. WE ASKED ALL THE CEOs, WHEN ARE  WE GOING TO SEE NET INTEREST  INCOME INCREASE, AND MOST WERE  CAUTIOUS AND CONSERVATIVE. THAT'S GOING TO BE AN ADDITIONAL DRIVER IN 2025, WE HAVEN'T SEEN  THAT IN A VERY LONG TIME. TO YOUR EXACT POINT, IF YOU HAVE GOOD EXPENSES, SOLID MARGINS,  AND NOW YOU GET TOP LINE  ACCELERATION, THAT'S OPERATING  LEVERAGE, RIGHT? THAT'S THE DEFINITION, AND  THAT'S WHEN STOCKS REALLY TAKE  OFF, AND THESE STOCKS ARE PRETTY CHEAP. JPMORGAN, IT'S A BEAST, RIGHT,  IT'S PRICED LIKE THAT, TWO TIMES BOOK. THEY ARE SO GOOD AT WHAT THEY  DO. HOWEVER, SOME OF THESE OTHER  BANKS ARE TRADING AT 1, 1 1/2  TIMES BOOKED, AND I THINK AS  ROTC GOES HIGHER, AND  FUNDAMENTALS GO HIGHER, YOU CAN  GET MAYBE INTO THE UPPER EIGHT  TIMES BOOK, WHICH GIVES YOU A  LOT MORE UP SIDE.

CONGRATS ON THE IPP AND WE'RE  LOOKING AT SHARES RIGHT NOW  MOVING HIGHER IN THE ME  PREMARKET AND THEY CLOSED  PRETTY FLAT YESTERDAY.  WHY GO PUBLIC NOW IN THIS  ENVIRONMENT?  PRETTY TOUGH ENVIRONMENT FOR  IPOs LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.  >> RIGHT, NO, GREAT QUESTION.  WE FEEL THE TIMING IS RIGHT.  AI IS IN FOCUS.  WE ARE IN THE EYE OF PURE PLAY  SEMICONDUCTOR AND SOFTWARE  COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE EDGE.  TOO MANY COMPANIES STAY PRIVATE  TOO LONG.  BY GOING PUBLIC, IT ALLOWS  NONINSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS  ACCESS TO HIGH GROWTH AI  COMPANIES LIKE US.  ALSO IT RESULTS IN CAPITAL FOR  US AS WE BUILD BLAIZE.  OUR CHOSEN VERTICALS INCLUDING  NVIDIA SECURITY AND ENTERPRISE  EDGE AND ASSISTANCE ARE  MASSIVE.  AND THEY COLLECT REALLY AT  ABOUT $71 BILLION BY 2028.  AND THIS -- WE DO HAVE REAL  PRODUCT AND SERVING THESE  MARKETS.  AND THE CAPITAL REALLY DOES  HELP SCALE THE BUSINESS.  YEAH.  >> NO.  NO.  I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK YOU.  JUST ANSWERED MY QUESTION AND I  WAS ABOUT TO ASK YOU WHY GO  THROUGH A S PAC.  WHY GO THROUGH A SP AC WAY TO  GET INTO THE MARKET AND WHY GO  PUBLIC AT ALL?  YOU COULD CONTINUE TO GET  PRIVATE MONEY INTO THE COMPANY.  >> IT DOES HELP IN TERMS OF --  THIS PARTICULAR SPAC ACTUALLY  CAME IN WITH CAPITAL UP FRONT.  AND THE CAPITAL DOES HELP  ACCELERATE OUR GOAL MARKET  FUNCTIONS AND OUR ROAD MAP AND  ALSO TO HIRE ADDITIONAL TALENT  AS WE GROW THE BUSINESS.  >> ALL RIGHT.  YOU ARE GOING PUBLIC RIGHT NOW  AS WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE A NEW  ADMINISTRATION TAKE OVER IN  WASHINGTON.  I WANT TO ASK YOU, HOW MUCH  PRODUCTION IS GOING TO BE DONE  HERE IN THE U.S. IF ANY -- HOW  WOULD TARIFFS AND POSSIBLE  IMMIGRATION REFORM, HOW WOULD  THAT IMPACT YOUR BUSINESS?  >> ACTUALLY VERY GOOD QUESTION.  IN FACT, OUR PRODUCT IS  ACTUALLY -- THE CHIP IS  MANUFACTURED ON U.S. SOIL.  WE GET A LOT OF QUOTES FOR  THAT.  IT'S MANUFACTURED IN AUSTIN,  TEXAS.  I THINK WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW  AI CHIPS THAT'S ACTUALLY  MANUFACTURED HERE AND, YOU  KNOW, FROM THE DEFENSE AND  THOSE KIND OF INDUSTRIES WE'RE  GETTING A LOT OF INTEREST.  >> SO MANUFACTURED HERE BUT I  WOULD IMAGINE YOU GET  COMPONENTS FROM OVERSEAS, IS  THERE A TARIFF IMPACT ON YOUR  BUSINESS OR JUST SUPPLY CHAIN  OR ANY IMPACT DUE TO TARIFFS IN  YOUR MIND?  >> NOT REALLY.  WE'VE ACTUALLY -- OUR SUPPLY  CHAIN IS BASED ON U.S.  SUPPLIERS.  WE ACTUALLY -- RIGHT THROUGH  COVID, RIGHT?  WE PULLED A LOT OF SUPPLY CHAIN  BACK TO THE U.S. AND WE WORK  WITH TIER ONE SUPPLIERS SO A  LOT OF THE MANUFACTURING IS  DONE HERE.  AND FRIENDLY COUNTRIES AS WELL.  >> ARE YOU CONCERNED AT ALL  ABOUT EXPORT CONTROLS ON CHIPS?  DURING THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION, WE'VE SEEN SOME  NEW RULES LAID OUT AND  REGULATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE  LESS UNDER THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION.  BUT THAT'S NOT 100% CLEAR.  AND WE WERE JUST SHOWING THIS  JUST NOW.  AS PART OF YOUR IPO YOU HAVE  BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE  PIPELINE.  A QUARTER OF THE PIPELINE IS  GOING TO UNNAMED ENTITY.  DEFENSE ENTITY IN THE MIDDLE  EAST.  ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THERE  MIGHT BE RESTRICTIONS ON YOUR  ABILITY TO SELL TO CUSTOMERS  LIKE THAT OR OTHER CUSTOMERS  AROUND THE WORLD?  >> SO LOT OF THE RESTRICTIONS  ARE MORE ON AI HIGH END  TRAINING SYSTEMS.

        "PR VETERAN. WE'RE GOING TO GET HIS RESPONSE  TO THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES PLUS SHARE HIS UNIQUE INSIGHTS ON THE WHITE HOUSE'S UNUSUAL ALLIANCES  THROUGHOUT U.S. HISTORY. JOINING US RIGHT NOW IS ERIC  DESSENHALL, THE CHAIRMAN OF  DESSENHALL RESOURCES. HE STEPPED AWAY FROM DAY-TO-DAY  DUTIES AT HIS COMPANY. HIS NEW BOOK \"WISE GUYS AND THE  WHITE HOUSE: GANGSTERS,  PRESIDENTS, AND THE DEALS THEY  MADE.\" AND WE'LL TEASE IT FOR NOW JUST  TO SAY THAT YOU GO BACK THROUGH  LOTS OF ADMINISTRATIONS, AND  THIS IS NOT JUST A HISTORY BOOK. YOU'RE LOOKING AT CURRENT  ADMINISTRATIONS TOO. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT  IN JUST A SECOND. WHY DON'T WE START WITH WHAT'S  HAPPENING WITH THE CALIFORNIA  WILDFIRES. ALREADY WE ARE SEEING THE BLAME  GAME TAKING PLACE. WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT WENT WRONG? HOW WAS THIS ALLOWED TO GET SO  BAD? WAS THE STATE AND THE CITY, WERE THEY PREPARED FOR HAT'S  HAPPENED HERE? >> I REMEMBER YEARS AGO THERE  WAS AN L.A. EARTHQUAKE, AND I  WAS WATCHING THE NEWS COVERAGE. AND SOMEBODY, A REPORTER WENT UP TO A TOWN MANAGER AND SAID, WHAT WENT WRONG HERE? AND I THOUGHT, WELL, THE EARTH  MOVED. AND SO, WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS  THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IN  THIS NEWS CYCLE IS BLAME. THAT IS THE ONLY THING PEOPLE  ARE GOING TO WANT TO TALK ABOUT. NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT  SOLUTIONS. IT'S ALL ABOUT BLAME. THE MAYOR REALLY CANNOT RECOVER  FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS. >> SHE WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY.  >> SHE'S OUT OF THE COUNTRY IN  GHANA.  >> SLASHED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET.  >> WELL, RIGHT. AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE A  MAYOR, WHEN YOU'RE SOMEBODY IN  THIS SITUATION, THE WHOLE IDEA  IN POLITICS IS, IT'S ALL ABOUT  ACCEPTING CREDIT FOR THINGS YOU  DIDN'T ACCOMPLISH, AND TAKING  THE BLAME FOR THINGS YOU DIDN'T  CAUSE. SHE IS GOING TO TAKE ALL THE  BLAME. THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT. THE ONE THAT'S MORE INTERESTING  TO ME, BECAUSE IT'S MORE  SURVIVABLE, IS GAVIN NEWSOM. BECAUSE HE WANTS TO -- HE WANTS  TO HAVE A FUTURE. AND WHAT IS GOING TO BE  IMPERATIVE FOR HIM IS WHAT THE  PUBLIC, IF HE WANTS TO RUN FOR  OFFICE, IS GOING TO NEED TO LOOK AT IS, HOW WELL HE TAKES YOUR  BEATING. ONE OF THE THINGS VOTERS ARE  VERY INTERESTED IN, THEY WANT TO SEE HOW WELL YOU TAKE IT. AND WHETHER YOU CAN ENDURE  TAKING IT. AND SECOND, WHAT HE'S GOING TO  HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IS BRINGING  MONEY TO THE STATE. THAT'S REALLY THE FOCUS. IN TERMS WHAT WAS THE MAYOR CAN  DO, THAT IS BEYOND ANYTHING I  CAN POSSIBLY COMPREHEND. >> HOW -- WHAT ARE GAVIN  NEWSOM'S ODDS OF SUCCESS AT  BRINGING MONEY TO THE STATE? ALREADY YOU'VE HAD THE HOUSE  SPEAKER, MIKE JOHNSON, SUGGEST  THAT THERE SHOULD BE CONDITIONS  TO ANY AID THAT COMES ALONG. AND CLEARLY, THIS INCOMING  ADMINISTRATION IS NOT FRIENDLY  WITH GAVIN NEWSOM AND VICE  VERSA.  >> I DON'T THINK THE ODDS ARE  GREAT, BUT AT LEAST HE HAS ODDS. THE MAYOR HAS NO ODDS. THERE IS NO PLAY THERE FOR HER. FOR HIM, IF HE CAN GET SOMETHING TO THE STATE, IT COULD WORK. THE PROBLEM HE'S GOING TO HAVE  IS HE'S GOING TO HAVE TENSION  BETWEEN WANTING TO REBUILD AND  ENVIRONMENTALISTS WHO ARE HIS  BIG CONSTITUENCY WHO DON'T WANT  TO REBUILD. AND SO IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY  FRAUGHT SITUATION. AND YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WANTS  TO BE PRESIDENT WHO EXTERNAL  CIRCUMSTANCES ARE REALLY GOING  TO DETERMINE IT MORE THAN  ANYTHING HE DOES.  >> YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO BE  LOOKING AT THE REBUILDING  PROCESS AND SAYING, MAYBE WE  DON'T DO IT AS MUCH BECAUSE THE  ENVIRONMENTALISTS HELPED PUT HIM IN THE POSITION HE'S IN? >> I IS THEY THAT'S A TENSION  HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH. THE PROBLEM IS HOW DO YOU TELL  PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES, WE  MAY NOT REBUILD? I DON'T SEE HOW THERE'S A WIN  THERE. THERE'S NO OPTION FOR THEM OTHER THAN TO REBUILD. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY, WELL, JUST  MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE. THAT'S A LITTLE BIT GLIB. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM HE CAN'T DIG OUT OF.  >> MORE THAN A LITTLE GLIB, I  THINK.  >> YEAH.  >> THEN THE QUESTIONS THAT COME  BACK TO WHY THE RESERVOIR WAS  EMPTY, WHY THE FIRE HYDRANTS  WERE EMPTY. HE'S CALLED FOR AN  INVESTIGATION. HOW MUCH PATIENCE WILL THERE BE  WITH THAT PLAYING OUT? JUST GIVEN THE ACRIMONY THAT'S  ALREADY BUILT UP? >> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT. AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH A CLIENT  UNDER ATTACK WANTS TO GET OUT OF THE BLAME SITUATION, I HAVE  SEEN, NO MATTER WHAT CHESS MOVE  THEY MAKE, IT ALWAYS COMES BACK  TO, WHO TAKES THE FALL? AND THAT IS GOING TO BE THE NEWS CYCLE WE ARE GOING TO BE IN FOR  A VERY, VERY LONG TIME.  >> HOW DO YOU THINK OF HE  CONTRAST BETWEEN WHAT GAVIN  NEWSOM IS DOING RIGHT NOW AND  BETWEEN WHAT THE GOVERNOR OF  FLORIDA, DeSANTIS, HAD DONE WHEN HURRICANES HAVE DEVASTATED HIS  STATE? BECAUSE YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS AND SAY, OKAY, THERE ARE -- THERE  ARE NATURAL DISASTERS, ACTS OF  GOD, THINGS WE CAN'T CONTROL. BUT THERE ARE HUMAN RESPONSES TO THESE THINGS.  >> WELL, THERE ARE.  >> AND THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN  PRETTY DIFFERENT.  >> I THINK THERE'S BEEN GREATER  COMPETENCE IN FLORIDA. I THINK THAT THEY'RE MORE USED  TO IT. I ALSO THINK THAT YOU HAVE A  LEADER THERE WHO, WHILE  CONTROVERSIAL, IS VERY, VERY  CAMERA-READY IN THE SENSE THAT  HE LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY WHO IS IN ABSOLUTE COMMAND. I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHY  GEORGE BUSH GOT IN SO MUCH  TROUBLE OVER KATRINA. BECAUSE THERE WAS REALLY ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO IN A NATURAL  SITUATION LIKE THAT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT THE  STORY BECOMES IS THE HANDLING. IT IS ALWAYS ABOUT THE HANDLING. >> VACUUM, DIDN'T HANDLE IT. A VACUUM, THEY DIDN'T ADDRESS  IT. IF YOU LET, YOU KNOW, THE CHIPS  FALL WHERE THEY FALL, THAT'S  EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO POOR  \"W\" BACK THEN. PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE NEVER COME  OUT AND SAID THAT BROWNIE'S  DOING A HECK OF A JOB.  >> THERE'S NO QUESTION.  >> MISHANDLED THE WHOLE THING,  BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. >> BUT I THINK IT'S STILL A  HURRICANE. AND YOU'RE STILL DEALING WITH AN ACT OF GOD. THERE'S A REASON WHY FORCE  MAJEURE CLAUSES EXIST, BECAUSE  YOU'RE DEALING WITH SOMEBODY  BEYOND CONTROL. THAT'S WHY I FIND IT HUMOROUS  WHEN I THINK OF THE REPORTER  ASKING THE TOWN OFFICIAL IN L.A. IN 1994, WHAT WENT WRONG HERE? THE TECTONIC PLATES MOVED.  >> RIGHT. LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR NEW BOOK. \"WISE GUYS AND THE WHITE HOUSE.\" WHEN I FIRST GOT WIND OF IT, I  THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE  LOOKING BACK AT A LOT OF  HISTORIC ADMINISTRATIONS THAT  WE'VE KIND OF KNOWN AROUND THE  EDGES, WHETHER THAT'S FDR,  WHETHER THAT'S JFK, SOME  ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE MOBSTERS  AND THINGS THEY HAD DONE ALONG  THE WAY. I THINK WHAT'S MOST INTERESTING  ABOUT THIS IS YOU TAKE THIS  RIGHT UP TO THE BIDEN AND TRUMP  ADMINISTRATIONS, THAT THIS IS  SOMETHING THAT'S STILL ACTIVE  TODAY. WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP -- >> OH, ABSOLUTELY.  >> -- BETWEEN ORGANIZED CRIME  AND POWER? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE  CLICHES WE ALWAYS HEAR IN  WASHINGTON, IT'S NOT THE CRIME,  IT'S THE COVER-UP. TURNS OUT THE COVER-UP REALLY  WELL. THEY'RE COVER-UPS. ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE SEEN IN  THE HISTORY FROM ROOSEVELT TO  BIDEN IS COVERING UP ORGANIZED  CRIME CONNECTIONS WORKS VERY  WELL. MY FAVORITE BIDEN EXAMPLE, WHEN  HE WAS RUNNING FOR SENATE IN  1972, HE WAS BEHIND. HE WAS A KID. HE WAS 29 YEARS OLD. HE HAD A SERIOUS OPPONENT THAT  WAS SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO BEAT  HIM. AN INCUMBENT. AND THE TEAMSTERS, WHICH WERE  CONTROLLED BY THE BRUNO FAMILY  IN PHILADELPHIA, MADE SURE THAT  THE ATTACK ADS THAT WERE GOING  TO HIT BIDEN ON ELECTION EVE,  THE NEWSPAPERS WEREN'T PICKED UP AND DELIVERED. THE TEAMSTERS MADE SURE OF IT. SO THAT'S MY FAVORITE BIDEN  ANECDOTE. WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT TRUMP  IS TRUMP DRIVES PEOPLE CRAZY  WHEN HE SAYS -- WHEN HE'S  ACCUSED OF SOMETHING NAUGHTY, HE SAYS, THAT JUST MAKES ME SMART. HE'S ACTUALLY RIGHT ARE BECAUSE  IF YOU LOOK AT HOW HE DEALT WITH ORGANIZED CRIME, HE DID IT IN A  WAY THAT WAS RIGHT ON THE LINE. NOBODY CAN PROVABLY SHOW THAT IT WAS ILLEGAL. AND TO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT IT, IF  YOU PICTURE IN MANHATTAN -- >> TALKING ABOUT IN BUILDINGS? >> IN BUILDING. YOU PICTURE A BUILDING BEING  BUILT. YOU PICTURE STEEL. TRUMP DIDN'T USE STEEL IN TRUMP  TOWER. HE USED CONCRETE. STEEL IS AN INTERNATIONAL  INDUSTRY. CONCRETE IS CONTROLLED LOCALLY. IT WAS CONTROLLED BY GENOVESE,  COLUMBO FAMILY. HE GAVE THEM A GOOD CONCRETE  CONTRACT. THAT TOOK CARE OF LABOR  PROBLEMS. THE DETRACTOR WOULD SAY, IF HE  GOT SOMETHING IN RETURN, IT'S  ILLEGAL. MY RESPONSE IS, IT'S BEE",

        "White house.\" and we appreciate it. >>> all right, we've got  breaking news just out. Wells far go reporting its  earnings. Leslie picker will join us right now with more. >> hey, becky. The market liking what it sees. Shares of wells fargo up nearly  3% on these numbers. Let's get to the fourth quarter. Reporting 1.43 per share gap  earnings. You can see up about 2.6%, those shares. On the top line, that was a miss relative to estimates, a small  miss, 24.4 billion for the  fourth quarter. That was down slightly year over year. But i think what has the market  excited about this report is the net interest income guidance. Because they are saying, and  this is new information, they  expect 2025 net interest income  to be 1 to 3% higher than 2024  net interest income, which came  in 47.47 billion dollars for the year. That's because throughout much  of 2024, we were seeing negative growth in net interest income  for the firm. For example in the fourth  quarter, wells reported $11.8  billion, down 7% year over year. So perhaps an upturn in net  interest income here. Noninterest income, as has been  the case for wells, up 11% year  over year. Although missing estimates  slightly. Investment banking fees up 59%  year over year. Investment advisory and  brokerage conditions up about  15% there. There were a couple of special  items in the quarter, which is  why we are not necessarily  comparing eps at this time. There was a 26 cent per share  tax benefit which was additive  to eps. Also a severance expense of 15  cents per share and net losses ",

        "Earnings results, guys. >> all right, lie, thank you. >>> jpmorgan just reported  earnings, $4.81 a share, above  estimates of $4.11. Managed revenue coming in at  $43.7 billion, better than the  $41.73 billion on the street was expecting. You can see the stock right now  benefiting from these numbers. The highest quality lender,  obviously. It seems like quarter after  quarter. You know, we see that with  jpmorgan. A lot of metrics that you can  look at. And we'll do that as we have a  chance to look, to mull over all these numbers in terms of book  value, price to book,  everything. I guess it closed at about $116  of book value. You can see not too many banks  trade, what is that, 2 1/2 times book? crappy lenders trade below book  at times. So, asset and wealth management, $5.78 billion. Maybe we need to start thinking  about charge-offs and the like  and net reserve builds. Charge-off, $2.4 billion. Net reserve bill, $267 billion. Assets under management, talking about blackrock in terms of  jpmorgan, up 18%. Market was up about 20% year  over year. So it all sort of makes sense  and probably not a huge  surprise. We'll have more on jpmorgan and  what to look at in relation to  its peers as well. They all sort of -- there's  similarities and macro trends  that affect all the banks. Then you can see some, depending on the specifics of the  businesses, some do better in  certain areas. The headline",

        "At bernstein previous wealth  management.  >> pleasure to be here.  >> just read it actually.  cme price in just one cut this  year, you are much more  optimistic and i would say  contrarian.  you see three cuts.  how does that happen and unfold  this year where so many other  people only seeing one cut?  >> the great thing about  economic utlooks is you can  always make adjustments to them  over time.  so the fact that we're on three  today doesn't mean necessarily  that we won't be on two.  one i think is probably not  enough.  if you recall last year, number  of groups were at seven and we  were not.  so i think we've been more  conservative coming into this  but look there's real merit for  them cutting rates but probably  not going to happen till  something in the june  neighborhood.  be patient.  >> year to date.  energy is the leader now.  tech is actually the laggard.  what do you make of this  divergence and change of  leadership at least the start  the new year.  >> expectation for the incoming  administration there'll be some  change in policy that will  drive solid growth and also  evaluation.  we talked last year and  everyone has about how  expensive the market is  especially in tech.  and energy was at the bottom.  anytime you showed an array of  sectors, energy was at the  bottom.  so the fact that there's a  little bounce off the bottom is  just that.  it's a bounce off the bottom.  >> all right.  we're also seeing a big change  in flows.  morningstar out with a new  report today looking at the  inflows into rsp.  s&p equal weighted etf.  for the year, $17 billion of  inflows and full year but the  second half of the year, $14.4  billion a lot of investors  obviously worried about  concentration risk.  the markets you are talking to  clients and are you worried  about that concentration risk  and how do you mitigate it?  >> there's a way to balance it  but the magnificent seven has  gotten the acclaim that it has  because there are earnings.  when you look at earnings  growth coming from the s&p, mid  teen year over year growth in  earnings but when you break it  down most of that is coming  from the magnificent seven so  yeah, premium valuation but  also driving real earnings  growth.  if you are investing for growth  you have to have some of that.  not a lot.  we're balanced about how we  have exposure.  >> i want to talk to you about  something  else.  the rise in the dollar.  again the megacap tech stocks  and mag seven get a lot of the  revenue from overseas and  certainly expected to be  impacted by the rising dollar.  are you reducing exposure to  the mag seven and big tech and  putting the money in the beaten  down sectors like energy?  >> there are opportunities to  make some adjustments and i  would say that clients and  taxable investors in the u.s.  hate one thing.  and that's paying taxes.  and if you think about what  technology stocks have done  over the last few years,  there's taxes there so you need  to be careful about that and  balance the cost.  but yeah, there's a potential  to make a rotation today.  i think look, the dollar  strength that we're seeing is  the cleanest expression of a  trump win.  and expectations are on what  the administration is going to  create.  we called in november to say  buy dollars, buy dollars, buy  dollars.  it's been the right call.  could we get the parity of the  euro for example?  i think that's certainly within  the range of outcomes that we  think is somewhat likely.  but it doesn't necessarily  diminish t",

LET'S SHOW YOU WHERE THINGS  STAND BECAUSE THE WORLD'S  LARGEST ASSET MANAGER NOW  OVERSEEING 11.6 TRILLION UNDER  MANAGEMENT, BEAT THE TOP AND  BOTTOM LINES. THE STOCK UP ABOUT A LITTLE OVER 2% RIGHT NOW. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, BLOCK  ROCK GENERATING $281 BILLION IN  NET INFLOWS. I ENDED UP SPEAKING TO BLACKROCK CHAIRMAN AND CLR AND ASKED HIM  ABOUT THE FACTORS THAT APPEAR TO BE DRIVING THE PERFORMANCE. >> WE ANNOUNCED THREE MERGERS IN 2024. WE SPENT $27 BILLION IN  ACQUIRING THESE THREE FIRMS. GENERALLY, WHEN YOU'RE DOING  MERGERS, CLIENTS PAUSE. THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT THE FIRM  LOOKS LIKE. THEY WANT TO UNDERSTAND, WHAT  DOES IT MEAN FOR THEM? OUR JOB IS TO TRY TO TELL THEM  WHAT EVERYTHING MEANS TO THEM. SO IN THE CONTEXT WHEN WE DID  THREE REMARKABLE MERGERS, WE HAD A RECORD AMOUNT OF INFLOWS FROM  CLIENTS. SO $641 BILLION OF NET INFLOWS,  $241 BILLION IN THE LAST  QUARTER. OVER $3 BILLION JUST ROM THE  U.S. ALONE OVER THE COURSE OF  THE YEAR. ACROSS EVERY SEGMENT IN THE  WORLD, WHETHER IT'S PASSIVE,  ACTIVE, INDEX, ALTERNATIVES,  WE'VE JUST -- WE HAD A REALLY  GREAT INFLOW. WHAT IT TRANSLATES INTO, CLIENTS ARE BELIEVING BLACKROCK CAN HELP THEM AND PROVIDE MORE FOR THEM.  >> WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE  DOING? MEANING, THIS MONEY IS COMING AT A TIME WHERE IT'S NOT BEING  EVENLY DISBURSED.  >> NO.  >> TO ALL THE ASSET MANAGERS IN  THE WORLD.  >> NO, I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON  IN THE ASSET MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY IS TRUE IN MOST INDUSTRIES. CLIENTS ARE DOING BUSINESS WITH  FEWER ORGANIZATIONS. YOU SEE THAT IN RETAILING. SO LET'S LOOK AT, YOU KNOW,  WALMART VERSUS SO MANY OF THEIR  COMPETITORS. THEIR MARKET SHARE REALLY  IMPROVED OVER THE COURSE OF THE  YEAR. I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON IS YOU  COULD PROVIDE MORE. IF YOU HAVE THE SCALE OF  PROVIDING THAT WITH YOUR  CLIENTS, YOUR CLIENTS WILL  REWARD YOU WITH THAT. I DO BELIEVE OUR PENETRATION  WITH CLIENTS WORLDWIDE, FROM  CASH MANAGEMENT TO LONG-DURATION ASSETS ACROSS THE BOARD, FIXED  EQUITIES AND ALTERNATIVES,  REALLY JUST GIVES US THAT  DIFFERENTIATING MODEL. NOW, YOU KNOW, WE ARE THE NUMBER ONE FIRM IN ETFs. THE NUMBER ONE FIRM IN  INVESTMENT TECHNOLOGY THROUGH  ALADDIN WHERE WE HAD 12% ORGANIC GROWTH IN THAT, ON TOP OF THAT. WE HAD 7% NET NEW FEE GROWTH. SO EVERY METRIC THAT YOU  SUGGESTED WAS A RECORD MOMENT  FOR US. >> WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES, INCLUDING THE  ISSUES OF WOKE AND UNWOKISM AND  CLIMATE. WE DON'T GET TOO DEEP ON THE  BITCOIN TOPIC. BUT WE GET INTO A WHOLE  CONVERSATION, WELL, GET INTO A  CONVERSATION OF THE MARKET WHICH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE IN A  LITTLE BIT. WE DO GET IN A CONVERSATION  ABOUT INSURANCE. ONE OF THEIR BIG CLIENTS ARE  INSURANCE COMPANIES, AS IT  HAPPENS.  >> INSURANCE COMPANIES AND  REINSURANCE COMPANIES.  >> INSURANCE COMPANIES AND  REINSURANCE COMPANIES, EXACTLY. FINK, WE SHOULD MENTION, IS A  NATIVE OF LOS ANGELES. I ASKED HIM ABOUT WHAT HE THINKS OF THESE DEVASTATING WINDS AND  NOT JUST THE PERSONAL BUT ALSO  ECONOMIC COST. >> AS A LOSS ANGELINO, IT IS  HORRIBLE TO WATCH. I USED TO HIKE THE SANTA MONICA  MOUNTAINS ALL THE TIME. I USED TO -- I MEAN, IT WAS ONE  OF MY PLEASURES OF GROWING UP. ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR SNAKES AND  REPTILES AS A KID, WALKING  THROUGH THE CHAPARRAL. AND I WAS THERE DURING THE GREAT BEL AIR FIRES. SO, YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALWAYS HAD  FIRES IN LOS ANGELES. BUT WE'VE NEVER SEEN THE  DESTRUCTION LIKE THIS. MAYBE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO  REDEFINE, YOU KNOW, EVENT RISK  THROUGHOUT SO MANY PARTS OF THE  COUNTRY. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG ISSUE IN AMERICA, YOU KNOW. THE ROLE OF HOMEOWNERS  INSURANCE. AND HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IS  BECOMING A LARGER AND LARGER  COMPONENT FOR HOME OWNERSHIP. AND I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE  AN ISSUE FOR GOVERNMENT GOING  FORWARD. AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS IS  GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGER  ISSUES THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE  TO BE TACKLING OVER THE NEXT  FOUR YEARS.

          "Split the trade off is we have  no manufacturing base.  we will save this for a follow- up discussion.  high rates are dashing hopes  for a bigger recovery in the  housing market pick and even  the one bright spot in recent  years, the homebuilder etf is  down 15% in the past three  months to my next guest things  that move has been sharp and  unwarranted.  john is back with us and he is  a senior homebuilder analyst at  ubs.  unwarranted?  mortgage applications were at a  30 year low. >> thank you for having me.  i think the fact of the matter  is that underlying demand is  actually pretty good.  the most recent data from our  evidence lab housing attention  survey shows 31% of buyers  intend to pull the trigger over  the next 12 months.  that is above the historical  average of 30.  the intent to buy or the  ability to buy and there are  headwinds.  but we have a lot of pent-up  demand and another built  market.  we think we will have those  single digit growth this year  with builders able to  outperform that pretty  meaningfully.  i think there is a tremendous  amount of fear in the market  right now and that is what has  been the catalyst for us to get  published typically this is the  time when the fear translates  into good opportunities for  investors.  >> the setup is strange because  we are in the middle of what is  supposed to be this fed rate  cutting cycle and traditional  you see housing start to pick  up a manufacturing start to  pick up and all the things that  benefit from lower rates but  rates on everything but  everything is one of the and  step.  for housing this will not be a  big contributor to any kind of  acceleration in growth at this  point.  >> i think you are right and i  think we are seeing the  currently with the existing  home sales that pretty much at  gf see trough levels.  the silver linings are twofold,  the public builders of the  ability to offer mortgage rate  by dell to keep the demand  going that is still there.  underlying strong basis.  that is a big advantage versus  smaller competitors and also  versus the existing home market  to the other silver lining is  there is a lot of concern about  inventory in the market and we  can sit and talk about why we  think that is overblown, but  higher rates should limit the  amount of inventory that is  coming in as the locket effect  comes back into the full force.  >> we joked or kind of a morbid  joke the biggest threat would  be normalization and the rest  of the market.  4% mortgage rates.  you recently upgraded to buy  wms, and talk about what makes  those attractive. >> i think for our top  homebuilding pick, i think the  growth profile is among best in  class among our homebuilders  and our coverage picked i think  valuation across the group it is very punitive, 8 1/2 times  earnings on average across the  group and you look at a company  like meritage trading around  seven times earnings and below  book value on forward estimates  to i think that is a compelling  story.  advanced drainage system is a  building product company very  much focused in terms of the  homebuilders on the front end  which is doing the horizontal  land development because before  the builders start developing.  i think that is a stop where we  are at peak fears.  something we think is a great  opportunity.  and another builder we are  pretty much bullets across the  board, we were little bit mo",

          "With the dollar, my next guest  says keep on your breath. It  depends on what exactly  president-elect trump annex --  announces next week.  we have the chief strategist of  interactive brokers to cnbc's  senior economics reporter is  here as well.  steve, there is a lot of people  going, once things get this  extreme how many more days will  rates go up?  how much higher can the dollar  get?  you say it depends on what  happens next week.  >> the momentum clearly a  stronger dollar, higher rates  right now but we will learn a  lot basically literally one  week from now when president- elect trump becomes president  trump. And we see whether these  executive orders that i think  have got the market a bit  fearful about the inflationary  impacts of tariffs and  potential immigration  restrictions. Let's see if the  market is overpricing the  negative. It would be an inverse by the rumor sell, the news, if  they turn out to be less  extreme than the market fears.  if they do, if they are  consequential, the trend can  continue  >> can you unpack a little bit  of the dynamic where we have  both high and rising bond  yields at a rising dollar.  i may throw in rising  commodities, you could argue  some things are going on.  which is driving which higher  or are they being driven by the  same news flow?  >> pretty similar.  in general if you have higher  rates in the u.s. Or higher  rates in any currency, is  generally helps appreciate that  currency.  you earn more interest by  owning that currency.  this case we have a little bit  of a kick on friday because we  learned that the economy, the  labor economy stronger than we  expected.  we should not be expecting rate  cuts anytime soon, necessarily.  and that freaked out the stock  market to a large extent.  the bond market reacted pretty  much as it might have but as  you take the rate cut  expectations off the table, the  dollar seems stronger against  other currencies where you have  central banks were more likely  to cut rate such as the bank of  england. >> it feels like the bond  market remains in the drivers  seat this year and that that's  i don't know what that portends  for stocks.  how do you explain the path we  may take through this?  >> it depends why the bond  markets, why the bond yields  are rising. If the rising to  get the economy stronger, that  is good and stocks can be  resilient under that  circumstance.  there are plenty of situations  where stocks and bonds can  diverge for well.  november 2023 was a previous  high for the bond market.  stocks did pretty well  throughout 2023.  again, the economic story is  good, they can diverge in that  way.  yields can go up in the stock  market can be okay.  if it is because of inflation  fears or because of some sort  of stagflation, all the  negatives, and if the dollar  get sort of two strong so  multinational exporters, the  ones that dominate major u.s.  indices, get their earnings  impacted, that becomes  problematic. >> how telling is it? the above  20 and sitting, does that tell  you they are creeping near the  downside?  >> vix, i like to say it is not  a fear gauge but it plays on tv  and it is not constructed as a  fear gauge and it is meant is  that markets best market  volatility over the next 30  days.  we said there is a lot of  potential news coming over the  coming days and also there is a  backwards looking element and  over the 15 sessions prior to  today, eight of them had moves  in the s&p 500 greater than 1%.  we are sailing volatility and  that is hitting priced in.  >> steve, maybe you can answer  that question for the bond  investors, is this a better or  stronger economy or because  tariffs and deficit issues and  the like?  >> i think it is all and i love  the way steve is thinking about  this.  it force my thinking which is,  why are rates higher and what  could potentially change?  i made a list and maybe we  could all add to this list.  let's start with the high  deficits that could go bigger.  this is something that  president-elect trump could do  something about.  but i think it is unlikely.  moving to the next thing,  better growth and productivity  outlooks.  the second i don't think  anybody has anything to do with  the productivity part better  growth that does look to be  part of what the market is  bracing for when it comes to  hire -- when it comes to higher  interest rates right now.  then there is inflation and  that is the fed's purview, and  we will see if the fed decides  to do more about inflation or  stays where it is at and think  it will drive down inflation  that way.  and then there is the answer to  the aspect of all of those  things and i think steve is  right to think that come  inauguration day we may get  more certainty about what least  in the months or weeks after  that, we will get a little more  certainty about what president- elect trump plans but right now  i think there is an idea that i  will sell the 10 year amid that  uncertainty rather than buy it  and you are right, i think, in  this notion that the higher  dollar i think should attract  funds to our deficit financing.  and that should be something  that helps over the long haul.  but overall my conclusion is,  there is not a whole lot really  that reverses course here,  unless president tru",

see it's sitting right at 495 right now and then you have the 2-year which is all the way up at 442 again questions about whether the fed's going to cut it all after the numbers that we saw on Friday Bitcoin is down uh about 9% from 92 supposedly support oil it's like pushing 80 again that's always helpful pretty inflation picture remember when we said that uh it just that this started so slowly with little singled digit like selloff you were saying from the beginning that you feel very uncomfortable with the and the way it starts like really quick big breaks usually that's like a bull market but when it starts slow you you you kind of write it off ah and what's it add up to now 7% 7% for the Dow it's four and a half still not that much S&P 500 but if you're talking about a 5% we haven't noted it hasn't been something that that just shakes your fear and that's the bad kind that when when it really shakes your fear it just usually comes right back up the SM or the the Russell 2000 it's more than 11% now from an all-time high so you're talking about a correction territory for some of these major averages and I think transportation's had a really rough day on Friday too transports I think this is the market having to realize that it can't have its cake and eat it too if you're going to be talking about um rate Cuts I don't even think it was strong economy it was strong economy and and it off on that but I think we've given up on rate Cuts already maybe one or two but now we're back and I that was what I was saying to leasman Pana I I I was telling him people are worried about inflation again and that's why the bonds are acting like that and a strong jobs number I said that'd be the worst thing on Friday and then it did and it was and Steve said no it's not a bad thing uh beforehand and then it happened and he says it's still not a bad thing and then even after it happened he said it's the did you read the W Street Journal piece on bonds I saw it yesterday so I don't know if it's in today's paper but I read Wall Street I read it over I read it yesterday online that's right it's online and it's such a weird it was a a kind of convoluted story trying to explain why bond yields going up may not NE necessarily be a bad thing and maybe buy into it but it was kind of convoluted it cannot be a bad thing if if if your fear is a weakening economy if that's inflation story then it's a much different don't we get inflation numbers this week don't we get a couple of them I think we do CPI and PPI I think we get something I I remember that it's you know what within a couple of weeks we're going to get something that is true we can always count on that meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg slamming rival Tech Giant apple on Friday here's what he said Friday on an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience they have used that platform to put in place a lot of rules that I think it feel arbitrary and feel like you know they haven't really invented anything great in a while it's like Steve Jobs invented the the iPhone and now they're just kind of sitting on it 20 years later Zuckerberg said Apple makes money by basically squeezing people and having a 30% tax on developers before we play some of these things we should talk a little bit more about what this means I mean this is almost a declaration of war you rarely see a big company making comments to try and draw in regulatory oversight but that's certainly what this seemed like I don't know if you guys he's been doing this though for the last five years maybe longer I think a lot he's been saying it relatively explicitly I think his argument has been both the 30% piece is something that's frustrated him immensely for on a whole level of a whole number of levels because there have been businesses that they've tried to build on top of the meta business like the metag glasses he was one of the things said that's that's the metag glasses is a separate issue where the 30% piece is about charging people and he's tried to build businesses on top of mea but then you'd have to be paying the 30% to Apple before you'd be able to build the additional business we cut off the quote that he was saying on this but he was saying like the big part of it is they're great for building the ecosystem but we basically don't want to pay to use the they don't want to pay to use the ecosystem and then the second part is the meta glasses uh which is that you know my earbuds where are my earbuds um they connect to the iPhone better than just about any other device that's made by a third party he said exactly that on and he's been very frustrated I have the metag glasses I like the metag glasses I have them too and I like them and it is a little bit more complicated to connect those glasses and it's a little more complicated to connect basically anything to an iPhone relative to the uh relative to an Apple device because they are using a different protocol now one of the points he makes about that which is so interesting is he says that they're arguing well it's a security thing yes this is what he said expli they're saying build the security into the into the service I'm sure there's elements to that which he's right about and I'm sure there's elements explicit where he said that this is just an excuse that apple is using privacy and protections he thinks it's a big scam and that's basically what he said on Joe Rogan that they're just using that as an excuse for any of these things it's just usually you don't see the big tech companies very publicly saying to The Regulators here's where you should go after them it's usually more of a a system of of Whispers of quiet behind the scenes or getting other people to be your proxy to go do it he came out and said it pretty explicitly and I you know I this is they're Frenemies right they work together on projects and and not on other things I mean I but I think that this is less of a friend ofy this is more of an enemy thing for a long time now I mean of the relationships this has probably been the most complicated over anybody I think people who are following this know this has been the most complicated Clos who's closer to the Trump Administration Zuckerberg who's trying to make some changes and make some inroads with it or Tim Cook who was very been there for since the last I was going to say I think Tim Cook is I think even Google might be oddly enough yeah but we'll see Google's close I think that that privately Sundar has had a oddly interesting relationship with Trump to the mag then as a solid uh member of the magga 7 who's not in the magga 7 Netflix Netflix is not but Netflix isn't really yeah uh Zuckerberg also described the company's relationship with the Biden Administration he said officials berated Facebook staff during requests to remove certain content basically these people from the Biden ad Administration would call up our team and like scream at them and curse and it's like these documents are it's all kind of out there did you record any of those phone calls I don't no I don't think I don't think we but but I think I want to listen I mean there are emails he said the White House asked Facebook to remove a meme that showed actor Leo DiCaprio pointing at a TV screen advertising a class action lawsuit for people who took the covid vaccine Zuckerberg said that they responded that they were not going to take down humor and satire Zuckerberg made those comments days after he announced that meta would end its factchecking program and replace it with community-driven structure that's similar to the one on X meantime uh meta platforms terminating major Dei programs those include relating uh to hiring and choosing and training suppliers meta said uh it is changing its course because of what they're saying is the changing legal and policy landscape surrounding Dei efforts in the United States as a result meta cutting its de team replacing equity and inclusion programs with programs that mitigate bias for all no matter your background it's also ending representation goals that it had created that they say set the impression that some of the decisions being made were based on gender or race separately Amazon halting some of its di programs as well spokesperson declined to detail the exact changes but said it would continue to operate organizations formed to hear worker concerns and advocate for specific groups including women black workers and military veterans and you know Robbie Starbuck the power and influence of Robbie Starbuck that's just it's just no no but he's just a messenger it was going no he's the messenger it's collapsing under its own weight but I think a lot of these companies have either heard from Robbie Starbuck sure I think they're about to hear from Robbie Starbucks but if if the problem wasn't there it wouldn't matter whether Robbie Robbie Starbucks some guy with a a man bun can't just come along and change all of corporate America if it's not ready it's it's dying under its own way collapsing under its own own weight um it's fundamentally probably not a great way to do things if it's not based on Merit we we should have learned that by now we all want to get to a certain place but you got if you do it wrong it's going to collapse te will be next coming up on squawk pod a Billionaire's pitch for sports investing why Mark lazary bought and sold the Milwaukee Bucks a pickle ball team and is now doubling down on women's leagues plus where he's finding other opportunities Europe because of what's going on in the Ukraine because of slow growth there we're seeing a lot of opportunity we're seeing that we can lend money and we can overcharge for that this is squawk po up and Andrew Q you're watching squawkbox on CNBC I'm Andrew sorin along with Joe kernin and Becky quick all right let's welcome a special guest who is here to talk sport Sports Investments the markets and much more Avenue capitals chairman and CEO Mark lazri and Mark we have so much to talk about with you this morning but I thought we'd start with sports just because you are somebody who looks at sports a little differently than most big investors do a lot of times people get into it because they're Fanboys they buy a team they love they hold on to it for forever through thick and thin and you're a little different you're not so sentimentally involved you bought the Bucks sold it at an incredible profit got into pickle ball sold out of that at a big profit too um you look at sports as an actual business and and you think people don't understand it what what do you see that others maybe Miss look I think part of it what people Miss is all sports ultimately is is how many people are watching it right so simple question like if you think of hockey half a million people watch it baseball a million basketball is a million and a half all right bull writing how many people do you think watch that um 200 million no 200,000 youan 200,000 I hope oh 200,000 yeah yeah yeah it's a million to 1.2 M okay so it's a much bigger audience really wow that shocks me I know sailing which three years ago didn't exist there's a sailing league today you've got a million eight you got more people watching sailing than you did basketball so to me part of it is you've got all these sports that people are watching so you want to sort of get into it and invest in those before they become um I would say sort of in the National conscience so you think baseball's overvalued for the number of people watching or do you think bull writing is massively undervalued for it's just undervalued I think what we're trying to do is find sports that are undervalued and invest in those um so that five years from now as they get their new media deals that's when you'll capture the upside and you've been able to do that by doing what what are the actions I know you're involved in women's sports right now you're buying a lot of women's soccer teams or making bids for them what where where do you see as the most undervalued places that have the most upside potential I think it's women's sports it really is and the simple reason for that is just as people like I don't know do you have little girls or I do right so if I would say for Joe and I our parents if I have sisters my dad never brought my sisters and I to a game it was just my dad and I right the idea that you're BR my daughter yes like it's inconceivable to you that you would not bring your daughter and that's what you're having you're having this change as more and more people are bringing their daughters and more girls want to watch other women play sports so you're seeing women's soccer you're seeing women's volleyball women's uh women's basketball those are just growing in popularity you think that women's sports will only succeed though if more women are watching those Sports so it's a generational issue or do you think you're going to UL ultimately for it to work you need men to be watching these Sports in significant numbers I ask because I think if you look at football it's actually like 6040 or maybe 7030 in terms of men to women but there's still a significant yep you need to have men watching it and I think this generation if you went when the New York Liberty ended up winning the WNBA title if you went to that you would have been shocked how many men were there yeah and that's what you're seeing you you need to have men and women watching but I would say today's generation doesn't care right the younger you are you're going to go to a woman's game you're going to go to a men's game right you know one of the reasons I really wanted to talk to you Mark was um what we're watching in college sports right now the name image and likeness money has changed the game entirely we're we're talking about things that it's hard to say that these are still going to be student athletes focus on the athlete part not so much on the student part and I I think you see an opportunity here and I'm trying to figure out what I think of that opportunity you've said that you'd be looking at some of these college teams that the colleges are going to sell them or at least majority stakes in them that is hard enough for me to get my head around how how does it work why does it work and how is it going to change things they don't have a choice you know and the simple reason they don't is kids are getting paid so whereas for me growing up the dream was to go play a duke or go play a Kentucky or UCLA today if you're a kid if you're getting paid money from University of Louisville and that's more that you're getting from duke you're going to go there and so the cost of that is going up and the problem for universities is you need that money to attract those students and the only way you're going to get that money is is either alumni are going to pay are going to give you more but the problem with that is it's no longer a tax deduction so if you I don't know where you went but if you ruers okay so ruers for ruers to get people to go you've got to donate but if you donate to University it's 100% tax deduction if you donate to the athletic department it's not so therefore you're going to find it's going to get more and more expensive and what you're going end up doing is selling these businesses not 100% but you'll sell 50% of that so that you can keep attracting students and as you attract students it's great for the institution but if you see an opportunity there it's because you think more can be done more profit can be generated from this isn't the university giving up on that profit if they're selling out on it early at a lower at a lower amount 100% no universities understand that but universities need the capital because through the capital more people are going to come to the games and as more people come to the games more people go to the university so they understand that and it's either alumni going to give you that money or it's going to be people like us but you think it's an important flywheel that they don't have more students who are attracted to the university if they don't build these big programs they don't have a choice and it's sad because I think college sports is getting dominated by you know Ohio Michigan and um all of those and you're going to have like for ruers it's going to be hard yeah so ruers needs to attract um more students who are going to come and the way they're going to do that is those students are going to get paid and and the opportunity for you and the places that you're doing this can you talk about any of the places that you're actually working on a bid right now yeah I mean we're talking to a number of universities and for us if you say University is making a 100 million from that we'll buy that for we'll buy half of it and we'll end up paying like around 12 times so University is going to get about $600 million and that helps them over the next five years to 10 years to compete and to build and grow how much do you think of all of this as a venture capital style approach versus a private Equity style approach I think it's very much private Equity I don't think you don't think that there is going to be a bunch of home home runs in here and a bunch of bankruptcies when this is all over no because you're investing in programs that exist oh no on the college sports side I'm just saying on I'm saying broadly speaking you got the college piece here you got women's sports you got sailing got sailing you got all sorts of things in here and I'm just sort of wondering do you say to yourself you know what I may strike out uh a whole bunch of times here but I think that there's so many you know not so many but even a couple of massive winners in here that it's all going to sort of make it you know come out wash in a good way no I think it's very much private equity and the reason for that is I have the cheat code like how would you like when you were in high school and you already knew the answers to the test you'd love that right you think you got the answers well I do and I'll tell you why it's actually really simple after it ends up being on TV we now know what the ratings are so why did I invest in bull riding because I saw that ratings every year for three years went up I'm not investing in things where ratings are going down and people aren't watching I'm only doing it after I see that people are doing it so the fact that you've got the the ratings every day after something plays that's what you've had in women's Sports women's sports ratings have grown astronomical so I'm not really taking any chances that's the difference like I'll give you an example and I I got in trouble for it um there's a new league the slapping League yep I know the league yeah and for for a hot minute um David zazo I think was um broadcasting some of it I don't think he is right now right but that League started out of nowhere and if somebody said to you well all you got to do is stand there and somebody's going to slap you right right I was tell have you invested in it no I haven't okay but do you know what the ratings for that are off off the charts yes and that's my it's mesmerizing I know but it shouldn't be it's yes but we know the answer right right and that's that's why it's not Venture the fact that power slap has taken the United States by storm is phenomenal but you and I would have said that makes no sense yet Americans are watching no no it it makes a lot of sense it's just then the question of what do you do about that whether you should allow it to continue Mark let's talk to you about the broader markets you are somebody who's always looked for distress that U or distress deals and found really great opportunities are you seeing any of those opportunities right now are you holding dry PW hoping for some opportunities to step up you have more opportunities outside the US you know in the US today there's a lot of liquidity I would say everybody is positive of what's happening and thinks that over the course of next year um you're going to have a market that's going to be going up Europe because of what's going on in the Ukraine because of slow growth um there we're we're seeing a lot of opportunity we're seeing that we can lend money and we can overcharge for that here in the United States it's just much harder for that that's was going to be my question how much of you are you playing around with the sports stuff and how much are you still doing this that this is what you do and I was going to ask whether how's lickstein looking for their crappy distressed debt pretty good if you uh or take your pick that's that's what you do is it and that's continuing how much of of your business is still that and how much is is this other stuff you're I think you're kind of dabbling in this other did you buy the PBR stuff are you dealing with Ari yes I am I am dealing with Ari you are I be getting a cut of all these things I get nothing I pay him why I don't I don't understand so yeah because he's PBR right he's PBR so 90% of what we do is our Core Business which is lending and 9% yeah and 10% is on the sports side that's the sports side is just far more interesting it's high profile you have big investors like a Steph Curry and without Wes V without Wes you wouldn't be doing any of this I don't think Wes Edens yeah but we're not Partners anymore I know but he talked you into that I he I just know the story that it was it was going to be too much and yes he did slapped you and he said stop whining and and get in here next thing you know you you got 10 times your money or something that's there was about 10 times more money so where in Europe where I'm sorry where Europe are the opportunities right now like oh I it's all northern Europe right now you don't want to be in southern Europe because the legal systems worse but for us it's northern Europe we're investing quite a bit in the UK we're investing quite a bit in Ireland um we're just seeing that you can lend Capital um we're lending money I would say at liore plus 8 lior plus 10 before we let you go Celtics are for sale yes would you buy the C at a $6 billion price tag if that's where it ultimately lands it's the Buy Low I think that's high yeah I the main reason it's high where do you think it ends then you think it's not going to go for six five and a half no I don't it should be somewhere around o over five the problem is you don't own the arena okay right I think if they own the arena then you would see them trading above six but since they don't you're just buying the team okay as a as a longtime Knicks fan do you think that the Dolan char Dolan will now uh Chuck will will sell I don't think he'll ever sell his father passed away there's always been a lot of speculation about whether the Knicks would would go up for sale I think he loves owning the team I think the team is doing well um they beat the bock how much you think the Nicks are worth you know I think the Knicks are worth a minimum of 7 T and all you would need is another person to show up and you could get involved in a bidding war but the Knicks could go for a hefty preium just like the Lakers could right mainly because in those two cities you've got a number of people who'd want to own that you would want to own it totally so put together Syndicate I'm with you okay I'll call you mark let's go back to what we're watching with interest rates here in the United States and how that plays in we're watching interest rates pick up and you can have a lot of different reasons for why people would say that the 10 years of 477 today you think it's inflation um do you think it's how much the government is spending and investors taking more note of that saying you're going to have to pay me more to do this do you think it's a sign of troubling times to come do you think it will present more opportunities for you from a distress debt perspective down the road I think it's very much that the bond markets look at and say there's going to be more and more money that's going to be borrowed and you and I both know as you're borrowing more money um that's just not good like in times of Positive Growth you should be paying down debt you shouldn't be borrowing more money and you know then if you end up reducing taxes um that's just going to increase the deficit so I think it's good news for equities because there's going to be more money available but it's bad news for bonds and it's bad news for interest rates because the cost of capital is going to keep on getting more expensive as that cost keeps going up for companies they're going to pay more and that's going to be benefit icial for people like me because you can then offer to pay them money to to let them borrow money right and I can lend at higher rates are you uh we haven't got much time are you glad you sold SE Island no cuz it's worth 10 times as much as you probably sold it for right well it's worth more but um it was a unique asset it's still a unique asset yeah and is there a better place do you think no I think you just I I think one of the things I've learned is try not to sell you cets I'm just I'm just throwing throwing him I I hear from Stylin when I mess the mayor he thinks he's a mayor of it's the greatest place in the world is it not I don't think anything's it's gorgeous are you glad you sold the Bucks and Fred r i I'm sad I sold the box I I loved owning it I think it was fun I think it's a great Club to be in um it was just a big chunk of my net worth yeah so what more did you need to accomplish there I mean you can't how many Nets once you win a championship how many Nets you need to cut down right um how many water how many boats can you water ski behind Gordon you can water ski behind a lot that's right Mark want to thank you very much for joining us we always love talking you and we hope come back how many Yachts how many Yachts not boats I misquoted uh the great GG next on squawk pod the massive Financial impact of the California fires is just beginning to be be understood our Contessa Brewer is in Pacific Palisades the economic impact estimates of 135 billion to 150 billion insured losses of more than 22 billion the emotional impact is harder to measure fanatic CEO Michael Rubin joins us on the quickly developing work of Los Angeles's pro sports teams to bring a little relief to Wildfire victims you've been through such a tragedy now if you've lost your house what can we try to do to show you that there's hope and get on the other side of this Sports brings communities together you're listening to squawk pod from CNBC here's Joe kernin developing story in the California wildfires Governor Gavin Newsome says this could be the costliest uh natural disaster in us uh history contesta Brewer joins us now from the Pacific Palisades area hey Contessa hey good morning Joe yeah wildfires are still burning and strong wind forecast for this week neighborhoods I watch them they're decimated lives livelihoods homes schools businesses lost and yet of course the work of recovery already begins Gavin Newsome's emergency declaration this weekend clears the way now for rebuilding he's ordered state agencies to streamline the permitting process the economic impact estimates of 135 billion to 150 billion being forecast by ACU weather insured losses of more than 22 billion that's according to Aon that's a new estimate over the weekend these are very early though and largely this is a residential story as opposed to a commercial property insurance story although it's not in insignificant for commercial either in Pacific Palisades where I am insurance coverage from the fair plan California's Last Resort insurer plays a predominant role claim payouts are capped here at $3 million so of course that leaves many homeowners underinsured a highly placed Insurance executive tells me that's likely a theme even where homeowners had coverage through brand name insurers because materials inflation construction materials up 37.3% over the Last 5 Years construction labor up 35% far higher than regular inflation homeowners may not have kept pace with their coverage meaning they may have coverage for say a $2 million replacement value where now it maybe would cost closer to 3 million also I'm told where homeowners have paid off their mortgages or never had one they may have opted out of the insurance coverage altogether given how high the price of insurance is and when it comes time to rebuild already Brokers are warning me developers of multi-unit properties May opt to take the insurance payout you know just sell the land and run because of the prohibitive cost of insurance it just makes developing land unprofitable President Biden has of course promised 100% federal assistance to cover all of California's fire management and debris removal cost for 100 days uh 180 days rather that's up from the typical 75% this is a multi-property unit here 16 units with amazing views of the Pacific Ocean completely gone at this point uh and and this creates all of it a short-term housing crunch maybe a crisis a top executive told me the insurance company he works for is already securing rentals of houses for their clients and two part of the big cost of this is that this is now a toxic waste site because of the flame retardant and the fire itself so that adds to the cost of demolition at this point something that will'll have to keep our eye on guys it's very concerning because the winds are kicking up again uh contestant I'm just wondering whether this could be replicated you you know who ran against Karen bass Rick Caruso who had previously been the commissioner for for uh the the LA Department of uh of Water and Power he's a billionaire developer and he he he employed private firefighters in water storage tanks and saved a his uh one of his properties a Pacific Palisades Mall everything around him is gone and and he was able to sa that I wonder if that could be replicated or whether I mean this is ahead of us now uh Monday Tuesday Wednesday the winds could kick up against again the gust of 50 or 70 mph um he's been very critical by the way of Karen bass and and U and government officials for you know uh fire preparedness insufficient water storage um everything uh in terms of forest you know what should have been done with Forest management but management right now that they're ready or could they be ready to do something like this to to save as much as possible from for what could be another uh another onslaught it's already it's already happening Joe while the fires were burning even last week there were neighborhoods that were banding together to say hey should we hire our own folks to go out and and spray fire retardant and then other neighbors said yeah but you know do we want to have this toxic chemical in our Lawns and on our homes if it's not going to burn so so that's already happening the second thing is take chub for instance which sells Insurance in the excess and surplus line so this is outside of the regulated Insurance Market they can charge what they think the risk costs and do and then and it's not subject to approval by the state insurance commissioner chub actually contracts with these private companies that go out and they'll you know tape up your vents and spray down your foam on your roof that's part of this high-end service that you get when you contract with chub so it's not just Rick Caruso a lot of people would have gotten this through their insurance company and you know know and and it helps protect your house the other thing that's going to be in focus in rebuilding is you know I I had just done a story on New Year's Eve about the mitigation available with with building materials and the way that when you build a house to withstand fire it can withstand a lot more a blowing Ember doesn't necessarily ignite that house then and so there will be a lot of focus even if they streamline it can you build back better and more resistant right like peppernut and I know lot expensive the the moat and but just water storage tanks I'm not even talking about the flame retardant stuff but but just water I mean they didn't have they didn't have water if you had a pump and a sprinkler system and your pool you could have done it and they they I've seen videos where people said the idea you know that the the palisad reservoir was empty uh contest that thank you Fanatics in 17 Los Angeles sports team there's are 17 teams have uh partnered to sell La strong uh t-shirts of proceeds of which will support the Red Cross and the LA fire department Foundation joining us now with more on the effort Michael Rubin CEO uh of Fanatics and I commend you once again um for what you're doing here Michael it's not over uh and I'm wondering any anything we can do now in anticipation of of the Winds kicking up again uh this week no look we're just getting started I mean I think we feel like anyone of our size and kind of who has a platform like we do you have a real responsibility to use your platform to make a difference and I think we demonstrated that during Co when we did the big all and challenge I think it was one of the biggest digital fundraisers Ever we' Raised 60 million bucks we made masks for the first time before anyone was thinking about it cutting up baseball facks and uniforms turning them into into masks and I think the great thing is to watch everyone coming together we actually last week started saying okay what can we do and then I got a phone call from Lon Rosen from the LA Dodgers said hey most of the LA teams just got together and said we've got to do things what can we do hey could you get fnatic to make a collection of apparel could they donate all the profits could you get the leagues and teams to donate all the profits that was like the easiest yes I got the phone call at 4:00 on Thursday and by that night the whole thing was organized and our entire organization rallied together and we launched it the next day um but we don't say okay we're done now by the way it's going to be a big big program there's already I think 30,000 individuals have bought around the world have bought La strong merchandise which shows people not just in Los Angeles but people in New York people in you've already spun the stuff up I mean we're we got it right here already it got delivered to me when I got here this morning yeah why did you pick the Trojans well my daughter goes to USC we got yeah we got to support USC you got Bruins um yeah we've got yeah we've got every I mean if you're an LA sports team whether you came up front or you saw this launch you got into it it's really about everyone coming together but the amazing thing is we're not like okay we're done that's us just getting started later this week um and our teams didn't want me to say this but you know I'll announce it here we're working to give away about $3 million of merchandise later this week early next week in Los Angeles to people that have lost their houses were actually looking for things that would be very emotional to them you know LA's had a lot of championships in The Last 5 Years they' Dodgers won the World Series twice um the Rams have won the champ you know run the Super Bowl thanks for that Lakers um LFC and the Galaxy both won the cup so we're looking for all that Championship merchandise because if your house burnt down you know that may be something was very emotional hey I had the championship shirt from when when we won um so we're going to get $3 million of merchandise together and just give it away later this week um one of the things has been heartbreaking but really interesting is the amount of individuals who have reached out to our company who reached out to me said you know my house burnt down but the only thing that really matters is this piece of memorabilia that I lost um somebody called me actually an investor of mine called me on Tuesdays the first person um and said you know my sister's house burnt down it was a very expensive house we don't care about the house she had a couple things from Kobe and those were her most important prize possessions can you get me something to help we place that we right away found those things so you know we've seen so many individual stories where I think based on the relationship we have with players with the teams we can create truly a dreamy um experience for individuals one by one that can't change the horrible situation of them losing their house but maybe can bring some happiness to them and I think it really is our responsibility to do everything we can and so it's great that we launched La strong with 17 teams it's great that over 30,000 people have participated around the world it's great that we're going to give away $3 million a product later this week but we're just getting started we're going to do everything we can and the RO Heroes here it's not us the heroes here are the firefighters all these people coming together I mean I look what they're going through it's insane and we have so many employees that are affected by this as well I mean the rebuild is going to take so long and be so demanding of of time and resources I guess you're just getting started but those are funds that can really go towards the rebuilding too yeah and I think our desire here would be to be one of the people who created the most funds for this and did the most in the city this is one that look there are disasters that happen often within a year but the ones that are really big and hit hard and this is very personal we have a thousand employees in Los in La yeah we have multiple employees that have lost their homes and I have so many friends that are you know have lost their homes on top of our employees have lost home so it just feels like your family has been so affected here let me ask you you have a home out there as well I do it's okay yeah is is your sense I mean what do you mean beyond the human toll which is obviously the the thing we're all focused on what do you think the economic impact on La is going to be obviously the Olympics are coming up by the way in 28 there's debates about whether the city's going to be able to actually rebuild by then there's World Cup there's Super Bowl I there's a lot of sports not just in the city already but coming to the city and here we have this this this tragedy in front of us yeah look I think the I don't know the exact numbers but I think this tragedy is of Epic Proportion I saw an estimate three or four days ago that said it already been $50 billion in damage and that was like three or four days ago um I think the Market's going to have to go through a lot of Correction I mean look La is one of the most amazing cities in the world I love this city you know I spend a lot of time there because a very it's one of the hubs of the sports and entertainment worlds but if you think about today it's very hard to get insurance right I don't have my my house I have an expensive house I have no Wildfire Insurance because you can't get Wildfire Insurance in Los Angeles um now I don't worry about my to me you know people ask me other the time is your house okay I'm like I'm not worried about my house I'm worried about all the other people that lost their houses you see people that owned a house for 30 40 years and now you know they can't afford to rebuild it they didn't have Wildfire Insurance how do you fix that problem I mean you're well I look I I think um government needs to act more like a business in this situation and and look this is complicated like you know there's like I you guys know I don't get involved in politics but I think here you need to go and say okay we have a real problem you're going to have you know many tens of billions maybe even could it reach a hundred billion dollar in in damage or plus you know you've got all these people have lost their houses how do we help them to rebuild the houses on a costeffective basis what happens if they didn't have insurance how do we not have people take advantage of them so I think there's going to be a lot of entrepreneurial business leadership that's needed I think you need anyone that can make a big difference that's your responsibility you run a big company you can help in a big way you know you're an insurance company I know this is a really difficult situation for you because La is a bad Market to insure but how can you help make a difference that's why for us we keep saying what are all the things we can do and I can tell you from the show I'll see reach outs and we'll get a good idea of someone hey we didn't think about that we should do that so I think I would say the biggest thing that a lot of people that watch this show can do you know these are some of the most powerful people in the world you have a big platform use that platform to make a difference that's why we want to do so many different things so when I see you guys in a month or two because I know you guys want to talk about Fanatics later we talk about here are all the things we did in La make that Insurance what are you suggesting insurance companies should do because they've left if it's not subsidized you got to let let them charge what they need to charge and it's going to be expensive and by the way if you can't get insurance I'm not sure that you can get then get a mortgage going for it right and so I think the Market's going to have to go through a reset to be more logical you can't force an insurance company to lose money that doesn't work okay the most obvious thing that any business person would say it's what any of us would say is is hey if we were running this wildfires are not a one-time thing in the Los Angeles area if they're not a onetime thing how do you now get prepared to make sure that the next time this happens that the the ability to deal with this is so much more effective but that sounds like things the government needs to do not just and I think the government needs to be more entrepreneurial because look I I you know again I you know I don't get into politics I like a lot of these guys personally it's politics not my thing if this were me I'd be in a war room with the smartest people could say okay this keeps happening it's going to keep happening how do we prepare ourselves differently so the next time happen and don't you this was just abysmal that they shot themselves in the foot preparedness was just certainly they weren't prepared for what a lot of people said was obvious and to me exactly um the biggest way I think you fix this long term isn't about how you force insurance companies or Banks or what to do I think it's to eliminate the problem going forward and I think the cost of eliminating the problem going forward is probably measured in hundreds of millions not billions it's say if you want to be prepared for this like you see all these things on social media about ideas people have there's a lot of good ideas we need to be entrepreneurial to solve the problem going people want to buy some T-shirts what they do they go to uh they go to any of their team stores to the LA Dodger store they go to fanatics.com can you do anything with the gambling sites that raise raise money or we keep we keep I love that everything with you always comes back to well you the first thing you said to me is am I using the fin yeah you told me no the one thing that's clear I'm I'm fully committed to today is about making to all the things we can do for a lot a different company a lot of different ways to do this but and and great for us the thing that we I will tell you one of the biggest ways to get your team we have 22,000 employees excited when you say hey there's a real drill to do things really quickly for something like this people love to make an impact when I was calling making people crazy during the all-in challenge and we raised $60 million um that we got directly to uh food insecurity our team they just they were so proud and I think people are excited about this they're excited about the power giveaway later this week they're excited about finding individual stories where they can change someone's life you know we just saw a story about I don't want to ruin it because we haven't done yet but a kid who the best prized thing they had in their house was a ball from one of their favorite players and you know maybe we can get that player and get them to go show up with that person's house and you know and so you know you've been through such a tragedy now if you've lost your house what can we try you to show you that there's hope and get on the other side of this and that's what and look Sports brings communities together and we sit in the middle of that and that is our responsibility and this is one of the you watch the the tragedy is heartbreaking one of the funnest things is if we can really help make a difference thank you for thek for coming short notice getting you on good good

          "joining us this morning Edison International CEO Pedro pisaro Pedro appreciate the time I know this is a very difficult week I hope you won't mind me asking just because the stock is on the Move whether or not there are investigations as to whether a power line was a potential cause well thanks for having me and let me just start by saying that this is heartbreaking in our community my wife and I have lived in Pasadena which is one of the impacted areas for almost 37 years so this is home and a big thank you to all the firefighters in first respon bonders and our workers helping out out there to answer your question yes there is interest and we filed two incident reports now one was for the Hearst fire which is now close to contained no structures uh impact it we know we had damage drawer lines there but the reported start of the fire the time of that start was 1 minute before we saw any sort of impact uh in terms of electrical anomalies in our system so I really don't know whether the damage happened before the fire started or after the fire started the fire that is in the most focus is Eaton and that's the one that's a much larger fire in the Pasadena aladen area now in that fire we fil an incident report uh that we put that out because we had gotten interest from attorneys asking us to preserve evidence because there was media attention but at the time that we filed that and still now U as we do our Telemetry our monitoring of the system we do not see any electrical anomalies and those are it's pretty typical you see those when you have a spark coming from equipment now there may be some other mechanism here and unfortunately we have not been able to get up close to the lines yet firefighters are doing their hard work and we have not been able to get close to those Towers uh but as soon as we're able to do that we'll investigate further and certainly be transparent with our public if we know more at some point but fair to say at this stage uh you haven't ruled anything out and there's probably very little visibility on a timeline for further Discovery yes uh it it can take a while and so yes it's uncertain what the timeline would be U we also need to ground this though in the framework that we have in California for Wildfire mitigation right we've done a lot of work as a state and the state uh legislature the governor The Regulators done tremendous work since the catastrophic fires of 2017 and 18 so we have a structure here where we have Wildfire mitigation plans that keep utilities accountable they spell out the wor that we're supposed to do and are doing uh to help prevent fires there's the work that firefighters have done the state has uh doubled the resources available for firefighting but they also recognize that especially with extreme weather uh the risk will never be zero and for those uh occasions when that risk materializes there's a wildfire liability fund that was set up $21 billion fund that is there to help uh people impacted by the fire along with a liability cap for investor own utilities like Southern California Edison now Carl that liability cap today is 3.9 billion do for any events happening over a three-year period yet our market cap has decreased by $9 billion since the start of the fires so I want to make sure that investors understand the framework that we have in California which is really a model for other states that are also experiencing Wildfire risk",

          "Biotech a player.  let's get more with our  evangelical peoples, -- angelica .  >> good morning, carl.  thank you so much for being  here, emma.   you are acquiring a --  >> thank you very much,  angelica.  it's great to be here.  it's wonderful to kickoff the  year with this good news at the  time of real momentum for gsk.   in 2024, we have, at the  beginning of the year, we were  able to upgrade our medium and  long-term outlets and a big  part of that is the real  momentum in our specialty  business.  we have made a conscious  decision to invest the back in  oncology.  that business was doubled  already up until the reported  results last year and this  year, we are really looking  forward to hopefully the  approval of multiple myeloma,  really important new drug with  various significant results in  terms of overall survival for  cancer sufferers with multiple  myeloma and this announcement  today is another ad in our  oncology portfolio, adding to  the assets that we have in g.i.  cancers.  we hope it's going to be able  to be a best in class solution  for those living with the g.i.  stromal tumor cancer.  they really data is showing  that the 90% of sufferers --  this potentially could have  broader coverage to address  that and be more tolerable.  so a great thing to add to that  portfolio at a time when gs k  has come back and cancer is  very firmly on track.  and obviously, we all know that  a cancer diagnosisis a  difficult one for the one in  five of us has to face that  personally.  i'm sure that everybody here on  your set knows or loves someone  who is facing that.  there's still so much unmet  need here in this disease and  we really are determined that  gsk will bring new, needed  solutions, not least in this  country roots remains the best  country in the world to bring  new innovation.  >> a big piece of your  portfolio is vaccines and they  have been in the news a lot.  he shared a stat that there is   to again five infants around  the world actually get the  vaccine.  we are hearing a lot about this  in the u.s. With -- how do you  feel about that and what his  presence might mean for  vaccines and your business?  >> well the first thing to say  is our purpose at gsk is  defined as getting ahead of  disease together and  that is  also what making america  healthy is, keeping america  healthy and it's great to hear  the new administration talking  about prevention of disease.  part of that can be vaccines  and, let's face it.  there is no greater  intervention in public health  than vaccination.  i think the cdc said in the  last 30 years, 500 million  childhood illnesses have been  prevented through vaccination.  more than 1 million childhood  deaths have been prevented and  that is something that parents  now don't have to, you know,  both moms.  we will have to worry so much  about our children and measles  or polio or diseases that have  long since been dealt with.  we at gsk really  welcome a  trance.  dialogue about vaccination.  the efficacy nation is the  efficacy. It appears have  questions, let's answer them.  getting ahead of disease  together is about  collaboration.  we look forward to discussing  that but remember, the biggest  business is also in specialty  medicine.  that's where we are seeing  double digit growth in hiv and  oncology.  and you know",

THIS TIME, IN AN INTERVIEW WITH  JOE ROGAN BUT NOT EVERYONE IS  BUYING THE MAKEOVER.  DIGGING INTO WHETHER THIS COULD  IN -- BACKFIRE.  DEIRDRE?  >> Reporter: OPPORTUNISTIC,  DISTANT U.S., SPINELESS, EVEN,  BECAUSE FOR ALL OF HIS RECENT  COMMENTS TO APPEAL TO A MORE  LIBERTARIAN OR CONSERVATIVE  AUDIENCE, THERE ARE PAST  EFFORTS AND ACTIONS IN THE  OTHER DIRECTION LIKE THE  PROMOTION OF PROGRESSIVE VALUES  ON HIS PLATFORMS AND WITHIN HIS  OWN COMPANY.  THERE'S ALSO BEEN STRICTURE  CONTENT MODERATION POLICIES  DURING THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTION.  SHORTLY AFTER ZUCKERBERG'S  LATEST  JOE ROGAN INTERVIEW  PUBLISHED ON FRIDAY, EPIC CEO  TIM SWEENEY POSTED ON -- BIG  TECH LEADERS ARE NOW PRETENDING  TO BE REPUBLICANS.  BE AWARE OF THE SCUMMY MONOPOLY  CAMPAIGN, HE SAYS.  NOW SWEENEY HAS LONG HIT OUT  AGAINST THE BIG TECH COMMENTS.  THIS IS THE COMEDY BEHIND  FORTNITE, ESPECIALLY AS IS  LOCKED IN A LEGAL BATTLE WITH  APPLE OVER ITS APP STORE  POLICIES WHICH RESTRICT THE  ABILITY TO EARN MORE MONEY ON  THE PLATFORM.  THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SWEENEY  AND ZUCKERBERG HAVE BEEN  ALIGNED ON SO IT'S INTERESTING  FOR HIM TO COME OUT AND SLAM  ALL OF BIG TECH IN THE WAKE OF  THIS INTERVIEW.  MEANWHILE, HIS COMMENTS  SLAMMING APPLE FOR NOT  INVENTING ANYTHING NEW SINCE  THE iPHONE, THAT HAD USERS  CALLING HIM OUT FOR BUYING  INSTAGRAM AND WHAT'S APP AND  MAKING SNAPPY COPIES OF TWITTER.

          "Of the biggest  firms.  $114 billion under management.  mathematical and statistical  modeling to create for folios  rather than fundamental  analysis and human managers.  joining me now in an exclusive  is cliff asness,  aqr capital  management founder,  chief  investment officer.  welcome.  >> thank you, sara.  >> we haven't talked to you in  a while but you are coming off  from another year  of strong  performance.  >> if there is wood here, i  would knock on it.  four strong years in a row, i  will take it.  >> so what is working?  >> last year, pretty much  everything except value  investing.  >> what you have been very  bullish on.  >> i have been.  it's a statement on quat that  one thing cannot work as long  as that's not all you do.  i once wrote a piece on our  website thing that we are not  all about value investing and  then occasionally when we are  in parentheses.  19 and 20, yeah, we look at  little like whil it is value.  the round-trip did not work out  and that was not so much fun.  but it's still a minority of  the process.  a lot of other things,  fundamentals.  you distinguish us from  fundamental managers.  >> yes.  >> i take a small issue with  that.  >> okay, go ahead.  >> we are just doing it in a  quantitative fashion.  we are just weighing them.  so profitable companies, less  variable when it comes to  earnings companies.  some more quantity stuff that  they will kill me if i give you  too much.  most things aside from -- and  value wasn't nearly as bad as  the headlights look like.  >> no, but last time we did  speak, i believe it was summer  .22 and you were pounding the  table on value and sing the  mismatch doesn't make any sense  and yet we are coming off  another year of growth.  why?  >> you're only starting with  what i've got wrong.  >> you started with value.  >> that's true.  all right, you got me there.  our versions of value are very,  very different than the popular  embassies.  most people only in the u.s.  look at the famous russell 1000  growth versus values.  and those are dominated by the  very well known concentration  in the market.  i mean it's an exaggeration,  but to say it's nvidia against  everything else --  >> pretty much.  >> it's at least directionally  correct.  the way that a quantitative  manager does it, or at least a  lot of -- i don't want to cling  to be special.  >> the biggest.  >> imagine you had 750 longs,  700 shorts, all none of which  are in excess of size around  the world and you are trying  hard not to take a big bet on  industries that you believe  value works better if you are  not taking a huge bet on a.i.  against textiles.  that is still not great for  value but it has been a fair  amount better than the more  famous versions that people  track that are really tracking  a handful of stock and really  focusing on the usa.  value has been better outside  the usa.  it's been better if you don't  take an industry bet and it's  going going to be better if you  didn't short a ton of nvidia.  so if value olds its own when  it's not going to be a great  time and everything else we do  works, that could be a  beautiful thing.  >> does nvidia enter your  portfolio at all?  >> it enters as a potential  stock to own or short and this  will give you some insight into  quantitative management.  i don't know if we are long or  short.  >> there's so many positions  that all times?  >> so many that are so small  and i often joke that this  hardly ever happens, that the  only time i know about an  individual position is  something very bad has  happened.  >> were very good?  >> they don't seem to bother me  with that.  warm going on tv and sometimes  i cheat and look up but i  didn't look up nvidia.  i would guess it looks  expensive but looks pretty high  quality.  >> earnings or so.  >> but that's not the whole  process.  for instance, profitability,  how much money you make, how  much money you make given the  size of your equity or some  other scale that you could make  relevant.  we love that.  in true bubbles, people often  hate low prices and don't care  about profitability because  they are only paying for dreams  of future profitability so we  don't enjoy those but a year  wh",

          "Course, behind chatgpt is out  with new recommendations for the incoming trump administration  around ai policy. Kate rooney joins us. She has the details. >> david, good morning. So this is a policy blueprint  from openai a week before the  trump administration takes  office. It includes recommendations for  lawmakers, and the gist of it is geopolitics, arguing the u.s.  needs to invest in ai  infrastructure to beat china. Openai's head of policy says  there's an estimated $175  billion from global funds ready  to invest today. They say if the u.s. Doesn't  attract that cash it will flow  to china-backed projects,  strengthening the ccp's global  influence. Here is what i was told this  morning. >> there are two countries in  the world that can actually  build ai and specifically ai  infrastructure at scale, the  u.s. And china. And so for the u.s., the  question is do we want to make  sure we're attracting that money to the u.s. As opposed to seeing it go potentially to china. So huge economic opportunity  because of what this can do in  terms of the economic  development in different parts  of the country, but also huge  national security implications. >> he calls it a race that the  u.s. Absolutely has to win, says chips data and energy as well as tant are going to be key in  winning. There is a line in the blueprint about models being trained with  neutral political values, trying to counter the woke ai  criticism. I also asked him about whether  elon musk has been a rival of  openai, and mark zuckerberg, who has gotten more outspoken would  support the effort. He said anyone who wants to see  the u.s. Win over china and  wants democratic ai to win over  authoritarians would support  something like this. I asked him quickly about mark  zuckerberg's more outspoken  stance lately, especially on joe rogan over the weekend.  >> in silicon valley there is,  you know, an interest and desire for folks to be authentically  themselves. I think that authentic quality  comes out over the long term and it's not only what people say,  but it is what they do.

          "Require a whole lot of new  thinking, everything from  construction technology to  permits. Bill baldwin is the ceo and  joins us this morning. Appreciate you taking some time  at a very difficult week. Good to see you. >> thanks for having me. I want to start with just my  heart is going out to everybody  who has been involved in this. I've been involved in this for  decades and have been involved  in rebuilding from fires before. What we're seeing is  unprecedented. It's heartbreaking.  >> i think the whole country has realized that quickly. Bearing in mind that the top  priority is caring for the  people and families of l.a., do  you think eventually we're going to graduate to a rebuilding  mind-set, and if so, how is that going to look or sound  different? >> i think they will. I think these communities will  come back stronger than ever. On top of all the grief and  loss, they have to brace for  some timing. It will take a while between  clearing land and getting  permits and drawing plans and  getting the estimates done  before we can get them back on  their feet. But that timing, actually, will  help from a building point of  view because that timing for the houses with the losses will  allow the building arts  industry, the architects,  buildings, engineers to gear up  and brace up to help these  people. I know everybody in my industry  is now trying to figure out how  do we best help. It will be a regional thing, it  will not just be local.  >> right. We mentioned construction  technology. Is that a big piece of this, how buildings are going to look and  be built differently, beyond the buffer zones and policies of the past? >> absolutely. When you look at, especially in  the eaton fire and altadena, a  lot of these homes that  contributed to the dominoing  from what was a forest fire into an urban fire, these are 60, 80, 100-year-old homes and they were vulnerable. Now everything is going to be  built to more modern fire  standards. Again, that in terms of fire  resistant materials,  landscaping, buffer zones around the house. These houses were significantly  better than what we've seen here and will be much more resistant  and it will make them insurable, which is a huge issue in  california. Yeah, the building technologies  will weigh in large and i think  it will be a huge part of  rehabilitating these  rehabilitating these  communities.  >> another is the timing. Typically doesn't california  have onerous permitting and  regulatory statutes when it  comes to development? i know governor newsom suspended some on the environmental acts,  for instance, in terms of  rebuilding. But what else, any sort of  indication on how long this will take? >> i think that's going to be  the start. They're going to have to figure  out how to move more quickly  through other aspects of the  building permit process. But, again, there's going to be  some time involved. Given the loss that's gone on  here, i hate to say this to the  homeowners, but there will be  some timing involved and there's going to be a lot of people  coming to the table. I think the fact that we have  total loss here and we have time involved, it's going to help us  gear up for it. But, yeah, there's going to be  some time. People are going to have to have some patience with this.  >> bill, there is a question  from some as to whether there  should be rebuilding in some of  these areas at all given the  changes in the environment, the  climate change, the expectation  for continued periods of great  drought and what that will mean  for fire risk. How do you see it? >> yeah, and i think everything  is an educational process, just  like earthquakes in the past,  we've learned from them and  adjusted how we build. This is an unprecedented fire. Santa ana is common here, but  this was 100 mile-an-hour winds. There may be certain sites that  are going to be far more  challenging to rebuild and we'll have to take that in",

          "This is primed for increased  engagement and produced a slew  of changes to its own content  moderation policies. Joining us is the former fcc  chair, now a partner at  searchlight capital. Nice to have you here.  >> good to be with you.  >> we were dealing with the ban  of tiktok toward the end of your first -- well, when you were  chair and the end of the last  trump administration. Where do you stand on it this  time? do you think it's appropriate? >> well, i think the supreme  court is weighing some of the  same national security  considerations and free speech  considerations that animated  congress in the first place to  pass the law. That law, as you know, was  itself predicated on president  trump's august 2020 executive  order in which he said this was  a national emergency, that this  issue deserved attention. And so i think we saw the  supreme court, really serious  consideration of the national  security considerations involved in bytedance, a chinese-owned  corporation, potentially  controlling some of the data of  u.s. Users of tiktok.  >> i mean, obviously, they were  weighing the free speech  implications. Many who listened to the  arguments believe they were  coming down more in favor of the national security  considerations. We'll have to wait and see. Meanwhile, your former boss,  president-elect trump is not in  favor of the ban. I'm sort of curious as to  whether you have a playbook on  how it will play out given,  obviously, the legislation has  already been passed.  >> it will be interesting to see what the supreme court does. Obviously they're weighing those issues i discussed. In the oral argument, if you  listened, they also opened the  door to procedural complexities. For example, could the supreme  court issue an administrative  stay to allow the next  administration to take some  action to facilitate a  divestiture. Could the next administration  simply decide not to enforce the law. These are the types of things  the supreme court opened the  door to. And interestingly, the solicitor general said she was not  necessarily opposed to an  administrative stay or the next  administration having a chance  to issue its own extension of  the divestiture deadline. We'll see what happens, the next week is going to be very fraught both in the judicial branch and  next executive branch. >> does the president have a  mechanism to intervene  otherwise? >> the president-elect did  submit a brief in this  particular case, weighing in on  neither particular side. Once he takes office, he might  as the supreme court seemed to  hint, have the opportunity to  extend the deadline for  divestiture. That's one of the things -- it  wasn't fleshed out in the oral  argument.  >> what about these groups that  want to buy tiktok here,  american investors? like the latest is kevin o'leary from shark tank. He's been at mar-a-lago. Does that help the chances or is that ultimately just in the  chinese decisionmakers' hands? >> ultimately it's in the  chinese decisionmakers it's  hands, and they've said we would not divest to any buyer,  wonderful or not. It's going to be a question of  whether or not the chinese  government allows a divestiture. The law does give the president, either the current president or  the president-elect, the ability to extend by 90 days the  divestiture deadline if, indeed, those discussions are going to  be likely to be fruitful. We'll see if a buyer emerges in  the next week who is credible.  >> given the complexities and  uncertainties, how do you think  about the rivals of tiktok and  how they're planning for a range of outcomes? >> it's interesting, what you  saw in other places where tiktok has been, banned or limited, for example, in india where tiktok  was banned, there's been a  massive shift to other  platforms, youtube and invoices. I would imagine there might be a similar dynamic here if, indeed, tiktok is no longer available on u.s. Communications platforms. I think by and large, the  u.s.-based social media  companies are relatively immune  from some of the same  considerations that animated the law here. So i don't think they're in  direct danger of being regulated the same way.  >> brendan carr is going to be  taking the job you once had  soon. What are your expectations in  terms of the fcc and how it will differ from that under the biden administration? >> i think brendan carr is going to be a superb chairman. I worked very closely with him  for many years and i know that  he has both deep expertise in  all of the issues, as well as a  determination to work hard to  advance the ball in terms of  american innovation and  investment. And so i would expect him to  clear out a lot of the  regulatory underbrush that has  accumulated over the last four  years. For example, there's bee",

          "Writing that after two down  years, eps is set to grow again. Joining us with expectations of  earnings, ceo of kbo, a stifel  company. What do you expect? >> good morning. Like you said, we've just had  two years of down earnings per  share, and we think the banking  industry is turning the corner  on a variety of fronts. One is we think we're embarking  on a two-year growth cycle. The biggest banks we think are  going to grow earnings 15% this  year, so that's because the  yield curve is no longer  inverted and it's because we're  getting a little bit more loan  growth. We also think that there's a  positive coming on the side of  regulation, which could have a  material impact on the biggest  banks and on other banks. And having just less intensity  like we've had it, we think  could be a bullish case for the  banks. So many of the banks still trade at a discount to the overall  market, right after the election the stocks went up 11% the first day. They've given all of that back. We know there's a lot of concern right now about higher for  longer in rates, and that is  causing us to maybe narrow our  stock selection some as we go  into this earnings reporting  season.  >> so how do you think about  winners and losers now that we  have seen this big rate move? >> so, number one is asset  sensitive banks. The way to think about it is the underlying trends are positive  for the industry, the banks that are best positioned are the ones who are asset sensitive, so we  like state street, for example. And the bigger banks tend to be  more asset sensitive. We also think this investment  banking cycle is gearing up. We've got 25% growth for  investment banking revenues this year and 15% growth for trading  in our large cap estimates, and  if the proposal does get walked  back some, there could be more  capital return. It actually would cause  citigroup's earnings per share  to go up by 18% if there was an  entire non-increase in the  proposal. So we think these are some  bullish factors that can support especially the biggest banks.  >> tom, how much are you  thinking about -- you mentioned  state street, we'll get their  numbers on friday. But the regionals and the  community banks, how much should we be thinking about a potential for an echo of what we got in  the spring of '23? >> well, so i think -- first of  all, the spring of '23 was quite extraordinary.  >> exactly. >> i think that had to do with  the significant change in rates  and how much bond buying the  banks had done during covid. So that has been better managed. And i think it would take rates  to go a lot higher. There would have to be a pretty  significant shock for more  pressure to come there. I think with the smaller banks,  they don't have the non-interest income resources in investment  banking, so their earnings per  share are going to be less  robust. We think they're going to grow  earnings at 6%, even though  there are several banks that we  think will benefit from possibly better or more tailoring for  them in the regulation side. So we think that on a  stock-selected basis, the  current rate worry is an  opportunity to selectively buy  some of the stocks that have now round-tripped the trump bump. So that's how we've been  proceeding. >> tom, it's not as though we're not coming off a really strong  year, though, for so many of the big cap banks. I mean, they outperformed the  s&p by a good margin last year. Do you expect that will be the  case in 2025 as well? >> david, unfortunately, that's  a reflection of how poorly they  did the year before. So, even though they did a big  percentage move -- my experience is, when the earnings profile  for a company is improving,  their earnings per share is  growing, it gives them a chance  to raise dividends, gives them a chance to build their balance  sheet. There's also a real capital  growth story in the banking  industry right now, which i  think is very positive. I have found over my career that that's a good environment for  the stocks, but i think you're  right. I've talked before on your show  about there being coiled  springs. I wouldn't call the sector a  coiled spring, but i do think  there is upside, and really the  best judgment for investors to  make is, is this current rate  worry worth what's happened to  the stocks? because there's a lot of rate  worry in these stocks at the  moment. But let me say one other thing,  though, to be cautious. You've heard me say this before  on your show. The biggest torpedo in the ocean is always credit quality. If rates were to go up so high  that it would re-ignite a  conversation about credit  quality, i do think that would  give investors pause. Our channel checks don't show  anything like th",

            ">>> let's welcome a special  guest is here to talk sports  investments.  the markets and more.  avenue capitals chairman and  ceo, marc lasry.  we've got so much to talk  about.  that we would start with sports  because  you are somebody who  looks at sports differently  than most big investors.  people get into it because they  are fan boys and by it seemed  they love and hold onto it for  forever through thick and thin.  you are different.  you are not so sentimentally  involved.  you sold the bucks at  incredible profit.  you get into pickleball and  sold that at a great profit.  look at sports as an actual  business.  you think people don't  understand it.  what you see that others missed  ?  >> part of it went -- what  people miss all sports is how  many people watching it.  simple question.  if you think of hockey, half 1  million people watch it.  baseball, 1 million.  basketball is one and half  million.  what about bull riding ? and  many people watch that quick  >> 200 million ?  >> 200,000.  >> it's 1.2 million.  more than baseball.  >> that shocks me.  >> sailing which three years  ago did not exist.  today got 1.8.  you've got more people watching  ceiling then basketball.  to me, you've got the sports  people are watching so you want  to get into it and invest in  those before they become, i  would say sort of the national  conscience.  >> you think baseball is  overvalued for the number of  people watching or bull riding  is undervalued ?  >> are trying to find sports  undervalued and invest in those  so that five years from now as  they get their new media deals  that's when you will capture  the upside.  >> you've been able to do that  by doing what ? i know your  involved in women's sports.  buying a lot of women's soccer  teams are making bids for them.  what have the most upside  potential ?  >> i think it's women's sports.  the simple reason is -- do you  have little girls ?  >> i do.  >> for joe and i who are  parents, my dad never brought  my sisters and i to the game.  it was just my dad and i. It's  inconceivable to they would not  bring your daughter.  that's what you are having.  you are having this change as  more people are bringing their  daughters and more girls want  to watch other women play  sports.  you wish -- are seeing women's  soccer, basketball.  >> women's sports will only  succeed if more women are  watching those sports ? is a  generational issue or you think  for it to work you need men to  be watching the sports  insignificant numbers.  if you look at football, it's  like 60-40 maybe 70-30 in terms  of men to women.  there still a significant --  >> need to have men watching  it.  this generation -- if you what  when the new york liberty ended  up winning the and be -- wnba  title, you would have been  shocked how many men were there  if you want to that.  you need to have men and women  watching.  i would say today's generation  does not care.  the younger you are, you go to  a woman's game will go to a  men's game.  >> one reason i wanted to talk  to you is what we are watching  college sports.  the name, image and likeness  money has changed the game.  we are talking about things  it's hard to say these will be  student athletes.  focus on the athlete part not  so much on the student part.  you see an opportunity here.  trying to figure out what i  think of that opportunity.  you've said to be looking at  some of these college teams  that the colleges will sell  them or have majority stakes in  them.  that's hard enough to get my  head around.  how does it work, white this  work and what will a change  thinks quick  >> the simple reason is they  don't have a choice.  kids are getting paid.  where as for me growing up the  dream was to play at duke will  play at kentucky or ucla.  today if you are a kid, if  you're getting paid 1 million  from the university of  louisville and that's more from  duke, you will go there.  the cost of that is going up.  the problem for universities is  you need that money to attract  those students.  the only way will get that  money is either alumni will  give you more.  the problem with that is it's  no longer a tax deduction.  i don't know where you when  it's.  >> rutgers.  >> for rutgers to get people to  go, you've got to donate but if  you donate it's 100 % tax  deduction but if you donate to  the athletic department it's  not.  it will get more expensive and  what you will end up doing is  selling these businesses.  not 100 % but sell 50 % of that  so you can keep attracting  students and as you attract  students it's great for the  institution.  >> if you see an pportunity  it's because you think more can  be done.  more profit can be generated  from this.  is it the university giving up  on the profit they're selling  out on it early and it lower  rate ?  >> 100 %. Universities  understand that.  they need the capital.  through the capital, more  people will come to the games.  as more people come o the  games, or people go to the  university.  they understand that.  it's either alumni giving you  the money for people like us.  >> it's an important flywheel  they don't have more since  attracted to the university if  they don't all these bill  programs ?  >> they don't have a choice.  clutch forces getting dominated  by ohio, michigan, all of those. For rutgers, it will be hard.  rutgers needs to attract more  students who will come.  the only way they will do that  is students get paid.  >> the opportunity for you and  the places you are doing this,  can you talk about the places  you are working on a bid right  now ?  >> we are talking to a number  of universities.  for us, universities making 100  million from that.  we will buy that, by half of it  and end up paying 12 times.  universities will get $600 ",

          "Angelica peeples is there and  joins us now as a special  guest.  good morning.  >> good morning.  we are here with dan from  gilead.  >> thanks for having me.  >> i want to start off with  hiv.  you have a big launch you are  expecting this year.  expecting to launch a shot  given twice a year and  prevented nearly all cases of  hiv in the late stage trials.  looking tells about the launch  and how your preparing for what  you see the timeline switching  over from daily pills to the  shot ?  >> gilead science is going into  2025 in a strong position.   one of the most important  things for gilead and public  health is this new  hiv  prevention medicine.  incredibly the first large  trial it showed it was 100 %  effective at preventing hiv in  participants in the trial with  only two shots a year.  it's hard to overstate the  impact this will have on global  public health.  it will change the face of hiv.  we are ready.  we filed with the fda.  we expect approval as early as  a summer and have programs in  developed world and eveloping  world to get this medicine to  the people it can benefit for.  >> you mentioned the impact on  global health and what you've  done.  the plan to make it available  in some low, middle income  families through generics  authorization.  critics say it's not enough and  want to see more from you.  how did you come up with that  plan and you feel it's enough  to address the need out there ?  >> this is a groundbreaking  medicine.  we are approaching our access  programs in an unprecedented  way.  immediately after we saw these  results with the community and  public health officials, we  moved to technology transfer  this medicine to six generic  manufacturers.  the supply and royalty free  basis to 120 low and middle  income countries.  in addition to that, because we  know those generic  manufacturers will get up to  still, we worked with two large  global companies to supply the  drug to no profit to us to more  than 2 million people.  there's much more we can do but  what we are doing is  unprecedented.  if we want to end this epidemic  which is our goal in the will  of public health officials,  everyone has to have access to  this.  >> i want to talk about u.s.  politics.  you are the board of the chair  of phrma.  you've got close pulse on this.  what's your view of this  incoming administration.  how do you see it ?  >> healthcare is not partisan.  it is bipartisan.  what is important in this  country because this is a  country that has he most  medicines, faster access than  any other country in the world.  making sure innovation  continues and also that people  can afford their medicines.  they can pay less out-of-pocket .  with the new administration  is talking about is a focus on  prevention and a focus on  chronic diseases.  for gilead sciences  it means,  medicines that we spoke about  that can be the best tool to  end the epidemic or some other  medicines we have like our self  therapy that the one-time  treatment pictures certain  forms of blood cancer.  that's in line with what the  admin station is talking about.  we look to working with this  administration and new congress  to make sure these legislation  and policies can be supported  for the american people.  >> we have a question back at  the exchange ?  >> it's good to see you, dan.  let's talk about where the  funding comes for your hiv  medication.  i know you will be giving a lot  of it away and getting out  there.  it's been either governments  paying for this medication or  private philanthropy,  philanthropic groups that have  raised the funding for this.  where do you anticipate the  funding coming from it for this  time ? this question if ornate  will be cut in the incoming  administration ?  >> it's a great question.  good to see you.  for a medicine like this, this  is a once in a decade medicine.  it was the medicine that  received the science magazine  medicine award last year to put  that in context for what he  could do for public health.  we believe the funding  mechanisms to your point  privately and publicly are  there to support this.  we've already been working with  the global fund to make this  arrangement and make sure to  million people can receive this  in the first three years.  governments we've been speaking  to our paying attention to  this.  if you can end the epidemic in  your country or in countries  around the world, the impact",

Equity strategy at  rbc capital markets.  your year end target for the  s&p 500 is 6600.  how confident you feel and that  given the pullback we've seen.  >> we were honest with people  came into this year.  the uncertainty factor is  elevated coming into this year.  i spent as much time talking  about the barricade case.  we were clear with the 6600 we  expect a 5 % to 10 % pullback  to materialize.  we get beyond 10 %, i think the  target is at risk.  we can withstand a 5 % to 10 %  move.  looks like that's where we are  headed.  close to the 5 %.  >> what are you expecting for  this week ? the cpi and ppi  coming up.  ppi and cpi.  earning seasons that kicks into  gear.  what should we be bracing for ?  >> they both matter.  i was talking to my rate  strategists.  interest rates and the fed call  reverberate on the multiple.  that's one thing we talked  about coming into this year.  with the fed pausing in our  guys changing their call to see  the fed is done and sing  january was the last one.  you will not get more will  double expansions.  the heavy lifting has to be  done on the earning side.  we feel pretty good about the  consensus numbers.  they are at 273.  my modeling is at 271.  if you look back to last year,  this reporting season companies  went out with downward guidance  to keep expectations low.  in the short term, that's  something temperatures to see  if we get that again.  >> inflation is problematic  because it not only eats into  the idea of the feds heading  rate again.  it eats into company's margins.  if earnings were going to be  strong, you hope you don't have  a rising inflation pick.  >> i'm not seeing in the  quantitative studies we do.  we read a lot of transcripts  top to bottom.  there's only so much you can  do.  the last few quarters we've  sensed almost a sneaky kind of  focus on cost like focusing on  it without seeing it.  if you look at 2025 bottom-up  consensus expectations for  operating margins in the s&p up  and coming down since last june  since -- it impacts the margins. It affects these vibes.  we are waiting for the vibes to  pick up.  and be strong in the new year.  inflation does way on the vibes  for the consumers.  >> you are doubling down on  financials.  you had conviction in this.  expecting regulatory oversight  would loosen up a bit.  we have seen a pullback figure  sticking with this.  >> i think we've seen a lot of  the postelection enthusiasm.  we've seen let's take a breath  and wait and get some  legislation and see how things  pan out.  financials were not so caught  up in things like tariffs.  it's more the regulatory  backdrops.  at the strong tailwind for this  year.  i never liked financials when  you go in reporting season.  i like them better when the  froth has come out and the  expectations are lower.  i don't mind this set up.  >> was surprised to see you  downgrading energy from what it  had been.  we're talking about wti.  the highest level we've seen.  >> we had survey results and  the last -- we do the survey  once a quarter.  the last quarters the effort --  analyst has come down a notch.  if you look at the utility  analyst, very high enthusiasm.  he has five different questions  in four of the five they were  at the top or second.  the enthusiasm was coming  through.  i talked myself into this  overweight back in december  windows marketing with european  and canadian and u.s.  investors.  there's not great evaluation  for strong earnings.  there's the a.i.  dynamic they are politically  gnostics.  i don't have to solve for what  will be happening in  washington.  i've been looking for this  drawdown and it's an area that  gives us that defense.  we had to move energy down.  we tend to overweight three  sectors.  a lot of things we like about  it i've been sitting on and  overweight for a long time but  didn't work and kept expecting  the geopolitics to bail me out  to me that risk premium and bid  the space up.  it's doing it as i've upgraded  it. I'll take it.  the reality ",

SOMEBODY CALLED ME AN INVESTOR  OF MINE CALLED ME AND SAID MY  SISTER'S HOUSE BURNT DOWN.  IT WAS A VERY EXPENSIVE HOUSE.  WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE HOUSE.

NOT JUST IN THE CITY ALREADY  BUT COMING TO THE CITY AND HERE  WE HAVE THIS TRAGEDY IN FRONT  OF US.  >> YEAH, LOOK, I THINK THE -- I  DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBERS.

            ">>> welcome back.  we'll get the final numbers on  the christmas shopping season  with the government's retail  sales report that's going to  happen on thursday.  but before that, senior  economics reporter the  professor, steve luceman joins  us now.  our cnbc nrf retail monitor.  good morning to you, steve.  >> yeah, holiday shoppers  finished the year with a strong  surge that brought retail  spending in our retail monitor  up to nearly 5% percent  combined year over year for  november and december.  let's look right now at  december.  retail sales ex auto and gas  rising over november.  that is the strongest monthly  gain in the 27 months of data  we have for the monitor.  taking out restaurants as well  showed an even stronger 2.2%  gain.  the data powered by real credit  card spending from it affinity  solutions showed a 7.2% year  over year gain for our headline  index and 8.4% for the quarter.  the late thanksgiving meant  december benefited from two key  shopping days.  the sunday after thanksgiving  and cyber monday were both in  december.  they're usually in november.  so we put the two together to  see what the holiday season was  like.  the headline rising a robust  4.9%.  the core up 5.1.  a good christmas by any  measure.  the nrf saying, households are  in decent financial shape as  the economy remains on solid  footing with low unemployment,  growing incomes and continued  deceleration in inflation in  goods.  looking at the two months  combined by sector, you can see  all kinds of good christmas  shopping stuff.  non-store retailers surging.  general merchandise up 6.2.  health and personal care, 4.5.  gas stations, they maybe  provided funds for that  spending.  they were down 3.5%.  electronics and appliances.  after november they had a  strong rebound in december.  the monitor can't measure  retailer profitability and  whether you have last minute  christmas rush resulting from  end of season bargains or,  andrew, if they were full price  sales.  we're getting someixed  commentary so far from the  retailers.  >> steve, how correlated are  these numbers or have these  numbers been with the numbers  we get from the government  historically?  is this like an adp style job  situation and then we see jobs  report from the bls and we go,  they don't seem to be the same?  how do you think about that?  >> it's a good question,  andrew.  first of all, i will say this.  we are just learning how these  things are working together.  we back tested them and on the  back test, in other words, the data we ran before we made it  public.  we were more closely correlated  with the revisions.  the difference between this  data and the government data is  the government fills in some of  its data initially through  surveys.  not actual sales.  all of this data is actual  sales.  and the last time i looked we  were like within .3 or .4 above  it.  this time around it's going to  be a little different because  the government does its  seasonal adjustment a little  different.  they won't have this issue of  not having the two big holiday  shopping days inside of their  number for november.  so they're going to be a little  different.  that's why i take the two  together.  then we'll see on thursday how  november and december come  together.  but our data correlates well  with what you had liz on last  week from bank of america, she  showed strong sales.  our data is a little bit wider,  we think by income group.  bank of america clients tend to  be a little wealthier perhaps.  we're all across the spectrum.  we got to watch it, andrew.  you're asking a good question  because we are in a new era of  big private sector data.  able to make it public.  we're trying correctly to  seasonally adjust it.  so far it's correlated  reasonably well but it's not  spot on the dime.  >> that stock market continued  to do the totally wrong thing  based on that jobs report on  friday.  >> yeah, look, there were  people out there, joe, who  agreed with me and said hey,  it's a good number.  it's good to have americans  employed and others who were  scared that -- i guess there's  two components of that.  the first is that you have this  possibility of rising inflation  that's going to have to cause  the fed to reverse.  and the other is that the fed  could be making a mistake.  that's why if you read -- the  fed is going to take a step  back and they're going to watch  how all of this plays out.  how it plays out as to whether  or not it's inflation behind  th",

          "About now.  nasdaq off 267 points.  s&p off about 52 points.  we should probably show you the  treasury yields right now.  because that is having an  impact on all.  the ten year has continued to  climb.  want to bring in chief market  strategist for the americas jp  morgan asset management.  what is going on?  >> i think it's a continuation  of some of the repricing that  we've been seeing for about  five weeks now.  i do think you're right, it's  very much being driven by a  shift higher in yield along the  curve, but i think most  importantly in ten year yield  and in specifically real yields.  so i don't buy this is all  about higher inflation  expectations or reset fed  expectations.  it's very much driven by  uncertainty in a different part  of dc.  so really i think we're all  bracing for a week from now  after the inauguration the  flurry of information we're  going to get and how we can  shape our expectations of  economic forecasts and risk  premium from here on out.  that reprices assets across the  board.  >> so what's the full reprice  look like?  when's that happening?  >> so i do think it's already  happening.  if you look at just the s&p  500, maybe you'll miss it.  it's off 4% off time highs.  the median stock is now down  about 15% from its 2024 high.  so i do think there's already a  bit of repricing and  understanding that it's not all  good, it's not all bad coming  out of dc.  it's going to take us a little  while to figure out how it nets  out for different companies.  and the scale, the scope, the  sequencing of policy.  what of course hasn't fully  repriced is more of airgap  tech.  more high valuation, high  expectation sectors.  and that could drive a bigger  repricing in the index.  overall given it's 40% now.  >> i know that what you do and  jamie dimon does don't always  correlate exactly.  we were commentingen this  interview where he called  himself cautiously pessimistic  as opposed to cautiously  optimistic.  do you have the same view?  >> i would say we're cautiously  optimistic about the economic  outlook.  last year was realizing  corporate household balance  sheets are doing fine.  we're normalizing across a  variety of indicators.  labor market.  inflation.  we're also cautiously  optimistic about the long run  outlook.  also a big story last year was  the improvement on the supply  side.  where we're more cautiously, i  wouldn't say pessimistic.  the reason for caution is in  portfolios.  there is a cost to pay a very  strong but very concentrated  returns.  when we speak to investors,  what was a 60/40 allocation is  now a 75/25 allocation.  that was 50/50 growth value is  now 60/40.  there's a lot of focus on  recent winners.  that doesn't set you up for  strong returns going forward.  >> maybe a curve ball.  maybe not.  it's obviously in the  headlines.  does what's happening in los  angeles do you think have any  meaningful impact on gdp over  the next several quarters?  if not longer?  by the way, you could argue it  could have a big impact in a  good way in so far as there's  going to be spending.  >> you see that with natural  disasters.  there's a temporary at times  negative effect which is made  up later as there's rebuilding  that takes place and then it  just nets out over time.  but i do think it brings up a  really important point around  when you speak to clients about  inflation, you know, we speak  about it in economic and market  terms year over year.  yes, it's normalizing.  but there's a cost there around  auto insurance, home insurance,  which is not just about  california; right?  it's about a lot of states in  the country.  i think that explains a lot  more of the malaise, the  frustration about the current  costs and about the current  economy.  that's not just reflected in of  course how we think about it as  economists or investors.  >> what do you think just so i  understand, what do you think  has happened in the last five  weeks?  why do you think the mind shift  has changed?  everybody was in this, i don't  know if it was a trump trade.  i don't know what you think it  was.  november, december, it was like  we are off to the races.  then everybody went for the  holidays and decided -- or  maybe even before the holidays  decided maybe not.  >> yeah, really before the  holidays.  so we started pricing in the  republican sweep mid september  so there was quite a long  period there.  and then you started getting to  december, you know, you start  getting into the weeds of the  details.  so what exactly is going to be  the sequencing of policy.  how is that going to net out.  is it going to be a net  positive, net negative for  different assets.  for equity specifically there  was more of a focus on the  positive aspects.  on friday we'll get the  forecasts around the deficit  and debt projections.  that's what's driving this 80  basi",

          "COMPANIES IN THE WORLD THAT  WOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD A VERY  GOOD EARBUD, BUT IT JUST --  APPLE HAS A SPECIFIC PROTOCOL  THAT THEY BUILT INTO THE iPHONE  THAT ALLOWS AIRPODS TO BASICALLY CONNECT TO IT AND IT'S JUST MORE SEAMLESS BECAUSE THEY ENABLED  THAT, BUT THEY DON'T LET ANYONE  ELSE USE THE PROTOCOL. IF THEY DID, THERE COULD BE  BETTER AIRPODS OUT THERE. WHEN YOU TOUCH ON THIS, THEY GET SUPER TOUCHY AND WRAP THEIR  DEFENSE OF IT IN WELL, IF WE LET OTHER COMPANIES PLUG INTO OUR  THING, THAT WOULD VIOLATE  PEOPLE'S PRIVACY AND SECURITY. NO, JUST DO A BETTER JOB WITH  THE PROTOCOL. >> THAT WAS MARK ZUCKERBERG ON  FRIDAY TAKING A SHOT AT RIVAL  APPLE. JOINING US IS GENE MUENSTER. GENE, YOU OWN APPLE. DO YOU THINK THERE ARE LONGER  TERM ISSUES AS A RESULT? >> I DON'T, BECKY. THIS IS BAD BLOOD BETWEEN THE  COMPANIES. ZUCKERBERG HAS BEEN ON THIS  TIRADE GAINST APPLE FOR A LONG  TIME. OF COURSE, HE DOESN'T LIKE WHAT  THEY'RE DOING WITH THE APP STORE WHICH BASICALLY BLOCKS THEM OUT. IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR META  TO GET ANY SORT OF EDGE IN TERMS OF HAVING THE DIRECT CONNECTION  WITH THEIR CUSTOMER. I THINK THAT HAS BEEN THE  ESSENCE OF WHAT HAS PUSHED THIS  AS FAR AS IT HAS. I THINK THIS IS BAD BLOOD AND I  THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE  TRIED TO MAKE SOME PEACE, BUT IT HASN'T COME TO FRUITION. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE  CONCEPT, THEY HAVEN'T INNOVATED. THEY HAVE. SERVICES WATCH AIRPODS IS 30% OF THEIR BUSINESS. THEY HAVE STALLED IN TERMS OF  VISION PRO CAR. THAT HASN'T TAKEN OFF. AT THE MOST BASIC THE MOST BASI  I THINK THIS IS JUST TWO  COMPANIES THAT DON'T SEE EYE TO  EYE.  THE FUNDAMENTAL REASON IS  BECAUSE META FEELS THAT APPLE  HAS CONTROL OF ITS DESTINY AND  ZUCKERBERG DOES NOT LIKE THAT  THIS.  >> IS IT ANTICOMPETITIVE  BEHAVIOR THAT RISES TO AN  OVERSIGHT LEVEL?  >> I DON'T THINK SO.  THE APP STORE, HOW THEY OPERATE  THAT.  YOU KNOW, CAN YOU HAVE  INDEPENDENT APP STORES AND THE  STEERING.  ALL THAT IS RELATED TO HOW  ZUCKERBERG'S COMMENTARY HAS  PLAYED OUT.  AT THE END OF THE DAY IS THAT  APPLE HAS BEEN LEANING BACK,  ZUCKERBERG SAID IT IN THAT  PREPARED COMMENT THERE IS THAT  APPLE LEANS BACK ON THE FACT  THEY ULTIMATELY NEED TO HAVE  THIS OVERSIGHT BECAUSE OF  SECURITY AND JUST A CLEANER APP  STORE.  I THINK THAT THAT HAS STOOD UP  ON THE REGULATORY FRONT.  SO I WOULD BE REALLY SURPRISED  TO SEE ANY SORT OF SUBSTANCE  CHANGES TO THE POLICIES.  I DON'T THINK THERE'S GOING TO  BE ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE  ELEVATED AGAINST THE APP STORE  IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.  >> GENE, LAST EEK WAS A ROUGH  WEEK FOR THE TECH STOCKS.  YOU WERE LOOKING AT THE NASDAQ  PULLING BACK MORE THAN 2.25%.  NOW DOWN MORE THAN 5% FROM THE  ALL TIME HIGHS.  THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE  WONDERING WHAT 2025 IS GOING TO  BRING.  YOU THINK THERE ARE TWO HUGE  THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING THIS  WEEK FOR TECH.  THE FIRST ONE KIND OF CAUGHT MY  ATTENTION.  THE CPI NUMBERS TOMORROW ARE  INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT YOU THINK.  YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THAT?  WHY CPI CAN HAVE SUCH A BIG  IMPACT?  >> IT'S THE RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN INTEREST RATES AND  RISK.  OF COURSE IF RATES STAY UP  HIGHER FOR LONGER OR BECOME  ELEVATED, IT MAKES IT LESS  ATTRACTIVE FOR INVESTORS TO GO  INTO RISKIER ASSETS LIKE OWNING  STOCKS.  I THINK THAT RELATIONSHIP WE  SAW OF COURSE PLAY OUT IN A  REALLY BIG WAY WHEN RATES WERE  GOING UP A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.  THIS STILL PLAYS AND NAGS AT  INVESTORS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH  INTEREST RATES.  I THINK THE REASON WHY THE CPI  NUMBER HAS MAYBE AN OUTSIZED  IMPACT THIS WEEK VERSUS MAYBE  SIX MONTHS AGO IS THAT THE  MARKET IS HIGHER.  I THINK THAT INVESTORS, TECH  INVESTORS ARE LOOKING FOR THAT  REASON TO SELL.  THIS COULD BE A HOT CPI NUMBER  COULD BE A NEAR TERM CATALYST.  THIS IS GOING TO BE A MESSY  WEEK.  THERE'S A COUNT BALANCE TO THIS  WEEK TOO.  TSM WHO HAS GIVEN THEIR  DECEMBER REVENUE NUMBERS BUT  THEY'RE GOING TO BE REPORTING  ON THURSDAY GIVING OUTLOOK FOR  THIS YEAR.  OF COURSE THEY'RE CRITICAL IN  TERMS OF BUILDING A LOT OF  ADVANCE NOTES FOR AI CHIPS.  SO I THINK AI TRADE MIGHT GET A  LITTLE BIT OF SOME REASSURANCE  WITH THAT TSM COMMENTARY.  OVERALL THIS IS GOING TO BE A  MESSY WEEK.  OF COURSE ALL EYES ARE GOING TO  TURN TO WHAT BIG TECH IS GOING  TO SAY NEXT WEEK.  >> THE BIG ISSUE YOU THINK IS  AI IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING  THAT CONTINUES IN REALITY NOT A  HYPE MACHINE.

          "Morning from bill ackman and  pershing square. It's a complicated transaction. I'll give you top line  information. He is acquiring the howard  hughes holding company. This is an under performer in  truth, but buying at a premium. Well talk about the premium in a second. Perhaps the larger story is this acquisition that effectively  bill ackman is going to attempt  to make now, would become a  permanent capital vehicle for  pershing square and puts  pershing square in the business  of buying controlling stakes in  operating businesses so much so  that the way bill ackman is now  describing this transaction is  to compare this deal with the  first deal that warren buffett  ever made. >> this is his way. >> with ies to mr.  buffett, hhh would be the modern bay berkshire hathaway with  controlling interest in  operating company. Pershing square up here and all  of the different funds. You remember that pershing  square sought to go public in  the ipo earlier this year. That was temporarily withdrawn,  but my understanding is that  they could decide to go public  again in the future. So, this is sort of an initial  step in this permanent capital  effort for pershing square. >> this is another vehicle? >> this would remain a public  vehicle and that's why it's  complicated. We should talk about how this  deal is going to go. There could be the additional  deal with pershing square till  goes public. We have the permanent feature. It's complicated. That's why i said bear with us  as we walk through this. Pershing square, we should say  bill ackman and their team own  44% of pershing square. In terms of this deal, howard  hughes has been an under  performer and not delivered  dividends. Part of his bet on this company  is he believes in the next  couple years it's going to start producing lots of cash and that  would obviously be a  requirement, if you will, to be  a successful venture to produce  enough cash to become not an  insurance company, of course,  but create a lot of ebitda and  start buying lots of other  businesses. In terms of this transaction  itself, though, what you are  looking at if you are a  shareholder of howard hughes  today, you have the option  effectively of cashing out  completely or you have the  option of rolling in which is  what they're going to be doing. You will be able to effectively  roll into this transaction which then be controlled by bill  ackman. >> they purchased a majority  share? >> they purchase the majority  share of the company. You could effectively think of  it in a unique way of take  private or take private public. Here's how it works. The consideration in cash is $85 per share. You are looking at $81.25 which  is a 38% premium before the news and 18% to the closing price on  friday. They are saying that there has  been speculation of what would  happen to this business, but you are also allowed if you want to  roll in the way they are to take a combination of cash and stock. There are going to be some  shareholders who want to go on  the ride with bill ackman.  >> you can't pledge your whole  shares because they need to buy  a majority of the shares that  take over? >> it gets complicated because  there are two ways to do this. That's why i said we'll have to  spend time going through this. You need enough shareholders to  roll in to make this all work. If it's all cash, that creates a new kind of challenge because i  don't believe they have enough  cash. The math is $1.5 billion total  cash proceeds from pershing  square and bond to finance this. Divide $85 per share. That's going to be the money  available on the cash basis if  the shareholders vote for it. Of course, this will require a  vote as well. We're going to have to get into  some of this. I apologize. It is super complicated. >> a $3.6 billion market cap. Pershing square has owned a  portion of this for a while? >> a huge portion. They will roll their shares in  and they are hoping others will  roll in with them and pay out  cash to the others. That's why you are seeing the  shares trade right now. I think that's a decent  explanation. >> you know where this company  came from? why ackman knows about it? general growth. >> this is the real estate  piece. >> he made so much money. It's almost -- that was one of  the great home runs for ackman. >> this business has not made a  lot of money. The stock has been an under  performer for a very long time  now. He's been out there and he loves the management team. He has been talking about the  management team for a very long  time. It has not been a great winner. There, we're showing you howard  hughes over the last year. Look at it over the decade and  this is a business that has not  provided a dividend. >> master of communities  business.  >> think about it.  >> makin",

            "Top ten names you need to own in the space. Dan ives sitting here with me. Dan, 20-year hitting over 5%. The real thing we are looking at is the 10-year at 4.75%. Putting a lot of pressure on  tech on top of the rising  dollar. How do tech stocks move higher  with the set up? >> i think there are two things  playing out. One thing, fundamentally, cap ex and what we are seeing is strong on the consumer side. That is actually better than  expected. We will see that in the  earnings. We've gone through this in last  few years. The ten-year bond risk off. We will have these moments. Our view is these are the  opportunities to own the  winners. Frank, i only think we're  halfway through the bull market. >> i want to talk about  palantir. Under pressure again. After the best performing stock  in the s&p last year, we  continue to see a selloff and  the stock under pressure. Are you concerned about the  valuation like so many other  people? they believe the valuation is  too high and it is difficult for the company to live up to the  lofty valuation.  >> if you miss the valuation,  you miss the last 20 years. Palantir, i continue to view as  the next oracle or next  salesforce. When i look at a.i. Revolution. When i look at numbers. $2 trillion of a.i. Cap ex in  the incomes few years. Where karp plays out the white  knuckle periods. I think this could be a  three-digit stock as it plays  out. These are the times that you  look at the winners and how to  own them.  >> you and i talked about this  before. I'm looking at the one-week  chart of the dollar. We did get a spike after the  jobs report. It was still moving higher last  week. I know you are bullish on tech. You are always bullish to be  fair. Out of the top ten, which do you see as most likely to be i am  pangt   -- impacted by the rise in  dollar? >> apple will have headwind. I think the street is already  factoring in some of that in  terms of estimates. I don't think this becomes that  dramatic if we actually start to see this curtail, but it just  comes down to, frank, a month  from now is a different picture  because of the fundamental  picture that plays out in tech  as this actually is seeing  strength being led by the a.i.  revolution.  >> we have seen a lot of  weakness in tech, dan. We have seen mike's article over the weekend. If you look at the average bull  market, this bull market has  more to go. Tech doesn't seem like it. Do the concentration. Tech is the engine moving it  forward. If we go to the next fed meeting and the fed continues to be  hawkish, that seems to be the  inflection point. >> that's also why you have a  diversified view in terms of  oracle or microsoft or high  growth names like palantir or  tesla and others. Our playbook has been you use  these opportunities to own the  winners. I get the bears will come out. The bond market, the ten-year  will ultimately dominate. That's why we're only halfway  through the bull market. It is not time to hit the exit. >> not just about the  fundamentals. Which one tells us where the  tech trade is with the sense in  the bull market and confidence  in the a.i. Trade? >> i think microsoft along with  nvidia. Those are the best in terms of  barometers with a.i. That stock has been under  pressure. Ultimately, look at apple. Apple with zuck. Specifically coming out of  china.  >> you mentioned zuck. We want to play zuck on the joe  rogan podcast.  >> because they have been so off their game in not really  releasing innovative things. The good news about the tech  industry is it is super dynamic  and things are getting invested. If you don't do a good job for  ten years, eventually, you will  get beat by someone.  >> your take. Aggressive take from mark  zuckerberg. Ever since he started the mma  classes, he is a different guy. A chain on. A different thing. In all seriousness --  >> mma battle with cook and  apple. It comes down to 30% with the  commission and what they're  taking and this is -- we're  seeing this game of thrones play out with meta and apple and  across tech because of where  we're going into it. It's frustration from meta's  perspective. For apple, as we talked about,  this is the year they have",

            "Zervos of jeffries. Good morning, good to see you. >> good to be here.  >> what do you make of the  weakness in the pre-market? we saw weakness after the better than expected jobs report with  bond yields spike. Is that continuing over into  monitor day or is something els  play? >> it is continuing and it feels a little bit rough, but i think  the important point of what you  just said with bond yields is  long-term interest rates did not spike. 30-year bond at 4.93%. It spiked to 5%. It is back to 4.95. It is almost unchanged from  where it was prepay roll. What is mogollon ving is the fr. People are getting nervous that  the fed will have to stay much  higher for much longer. That's actually not going to be  the right signal for the fed. So, the interesting thing about  the price action said to me on  friday and is continuing today  into monday is even though we  saw this unbelievable strength  in the u.s. Economy and people  are optimistic about the  strength going forward, they are getting increasingly worried the fed will have to make a mistake  and they are getting nervous of  the prospects for growth.  >> i'm looking at the chart. It did spike on friday after the jobs report, but 1.5%. A huge move for currency over  that period of time. You talk about the concentration in the market. These big tech stocks get  revenues overseas. Do you think the strength of the dollar would hit the earnings? is that something that is not  priced into the market? is that something you are  watching? >> watching the dollar closely. That is tied into the yields. For sure, the markets are going  to get nervous about that ever  strengthening dollar. That is putting us in a less  competitive position in the  united states and that is making it harder to do business with  that competition. That's going to weigh on every  stock, not just the tech stocks, but anybody that looks at  valuation globally is saying  these stocks look even more  overvalued relative to their  competitors overseas. That's going to be a tricky  thing to deal with. That is also a sign that it's  not inflation expectations or  credibility or some story that  the u.s. Is losing control of  the policy vis-a-vis inflation. If that was the case, people  wouldn't be flocking to the  dollar. This is not an inflation story. This is the story the fed is  getting -- i don't want to say  tricked, but forced to stay a  little too high a little too  long because they're getting  mixed signals from the market  and there is also a potential  for a little battle with the  trump administration and jay  powell as we saw before in the  trump 1.0 administration. >> david, we don't want to get  too far ahead. Let's focus on today's action if you don't mind. I want to get your word of the  day. The word of what we should  expect today or this week.  >> i think the word of the day  is the university of michigan or umich as we call it. That piece of data got under the skin of the market on friday. It was a huge spike in the long  run expectations from 2.8% to  3.5%. It is generally revised down. That has the market very  nervous. We're not seeing that in the  price action. We're seeing that as a scare. Meaning people don't think  inflation expectations are doing that, but the reason why the fed is going to be a little more  stubborn in terms of its rate  moves in 2025. That's just got people pricing  in a mistake more aggressively. I think that's how i",

          "Joining me now is jeremy  schwartz at wisdomtree. >> great to see you, frank.  >> we see a lot of volatility in the market and declines in the  markets. Do you think all of this has to  do with the fed and people  having less confidence in the  fed cutting one time this year  and definitely having less  confidence in them cutting two  times this year? >> as you said, the bond yields  is all about the bond yields. The ten year, we were on with  you in december and saying we  could get to 5%. I think that's still our  baseline that we get from 5% to  5.5% at the high end. Now it would be a normal and  healthy economy. It is possible we have the yield curve uninverted, but the  ten-year is around 50 or 55  basis points higher. The normal is 00 to 120. That would be another 50 basis  points hawaiier  higher from he. That does put more competition. The earnings yield is less than  the ten-year treasury compared  to tips. There is more competition.  >> you are saying the bond  market is creating competition. Not necessarily the bond yields  have a fundamental reason to  selloff. I do want to ask, we see so much mania in the markets. We see the a.i. Trade. Are you seeing sentiment has  shifted so much that people  thought there was no alternative to anything but equities because of the possibility of a  reasonable mind set or are they  scared of the volatility and  equity market? >> you know, the stocks are also the present value of cash flow. You get a higher discount rate  and it brings down valuations. The quantum is its own world. The mag seven is 30 times  earnings. The quantum is on future  expectations. Those are really speculative  stocks. If you look at the core s&p 500  and tech stocks surrounding it,  you just talked about  zuckerberg's comments and apple. Some of those are not cheap  stocks. They have to deliver on the  earnings. They have been. They have been delivering. They deserve the 30 times  earnings for the mag seven  versus the 17 times for  everything else. As that ten-year peaks out,  that's where you get another  move higher in the markets. It is, again, a healthy economy  that's driving the ten-year  yields higher.  >> you are saying once the  yields peak out, you can get up  to 5.25. Once people feel it is stable,  the bull market continues. Mike santoli had an interesting  article over the weekend. Any thoughts about the  volatility just being normal or  overblown? the blue line is the average  bull mark. It continues for 800 days. The continued line is the orange line is 600 days. Do you get the idea you are  seeing churns in the bull market and we have more room to run and the short-term volatility is  maybe overblown? >> i think it's all natural from what we see going on now. We think this pull back, as he  said, the ten-year can go  higher. Eventually, you will get this  rotation. We haven't seen that value or  small cap. That is relying on the fed  because they are the ones paying the rates. The valuations are being  pressured a little bit which is  normal and healthy. As people get confident the  yields stop rising, we get  continued --  >> jeremy, we are almost out of  time. You talk about the wisdomtree  wtf. You believe it will  reaccelerate. What is sparking in your mind as we go to 2025? >> what i love about this fund,  they do a lot of dividends and  buybacks which is around 7%. You have a 13 pe. Ten points lower than the s&p. These are ten points less and  they are doing buybacks. The companies and management are voting with their feet and  buying back their ",

            "HE'S HERE. LET ME INTRO YOU. LET ME GIVE YOU WHAT YOU  DESERVE. IN A GOOD WAY. THE DOW TUMBLED 00 POINTS ON  FRIDAY. THE FED HITS THE PAUSE ON THE  RATE CUT. JOINING US IS TOM LEE FROM  FUNDSTRAT AND CNBC CONTRIBUTOR. I DO REMEMBER YOU SORT OF BEING  POSITIVE OVERALL ABOUT THE  MARKET THIS YEAR, BUT WITH SOME  TREPIDATION NEAR TERM. MOST OF YOUR CALLS, RECENTLY,  HAVE BEEN LESS ON THE STRENGTH  OF THE ECONOMY AND MORE ON  INFLATION DATA. SOME OF YOUR -- WHEN YOU WERE  CALLING THINGS, S&P IS GOING TO  END THE WEEK 8% HIGHER BECAUSE  OF INFLATION OR SOMETHING. WE GOT INFLATION THIS WEEK. THERE ARE CONCERNS. I TIE A LOT OF THE WEAKNESS IN  THE MARKET TO THAT. ARE THESE IMPORTANT NUMBERS? >> IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE, AS  YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN CORRECTING  NOW FOR ALMOST A MONTH. 23 TRADING DAYS AND THIS  WEDNESDAY IS AN IMPORTANT DAY  BECAUSE IT'S A POSSIBLE TURNING  POINT FOR MARKETS AND I WOULD  LIKE TO SEE CPI COME IN  BELOW .25 OR SO. I THINK THAT WOULD GIVE THAT  JOLT OF CONFIDENCE TO MARKETS ON TOP OF EARNINGS, WHICH IS GOING  TO BE A POSITIVE CATALYST, BUT  FOR INVESTORS IN THE NEAR TERM,  THEY HAVE TO RIDE OUT THE  VOLATILITY BECAUSE YIELDS HERE  HAVE MADE PEOPLE NERVOUS. NOT NECESSARILY DETERIORATE TO  THE LONG TERM OUTLOOK, BUT NEAR  TERM. >> ARE THEY SMART THE YIELDS OR  NOT GIVING US THE CORRECT  SIGNAL? YOU SOUND REALLY LIKE YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT THE INFLATION DATA  THIS WEEK. >> UH, I'LL HAVE A BETTER SENSE  OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS AS WE  SORT OF FINALIZE OUR  EXPECTATIONS ARE, BUT THE ONLY  HESITATION WE HAVE IS THAT THE  HURRICANES LAST YEAR HAVE  MUDDLED SOME OF THE INFLATION  QUALITY BECAUSE FOR INSTANCE,  HOTEL RESERVATIONS WOULD GO UP  BECAUSE OF THE NATURAL DISASTERS AND IT WILL HAPPEN NOW WITH THE  L.A. FIRES. I THINK IT WILL MUDDLE USED CAR  PRICES AS WELL. YOU HAVE TO REPLACE THE CARS. >> IF IT WEREN'T MUDDLED, YOU  THINK INFLATION ISN'T THAT BIG  OF A CONCERN. WHEN YOU SAY A TURNING POINT IN  THE MARKETS, IF WE HAVE BEEN  DOWN FOR A MONTH, TURNING POINT  DOESN'T MEAN FURTHER WEAKNESS,  YOU THINK WE MIGHT BE MAKING A  BOTTOM THIS WEEK? >> YES, OUR TECHNICIAN MARK  THINKS 5,700 COULD BE THE  TURNING POINT. IT COULD HAPPEN WEDNESDAY MAYBE  2% DOWN FROM HERE. THAT'S WHERE THE MARKET COULD  MAKE A STAND. I THINK IF WE LIFT THE CLOUD OF  THE MUDDLING AND WALLER SAID  MOST OF THE INFLATION WAS ABOUT  MUTED PRICES. THE REAL PRICE OF INFLATION WAS  MUCH LOWER. I STILL THINK THAT IS THE CASE. INFLATION IS WEAKER WHEN YOU  LOOK AT HOUSING, ET CETERA, ONCE WE GET THROUGH THAT NOISE. INVESTORS, I THINK, SHOULDN'T BE SOME GLUM. I THINK EARNINGS SEASON IS  SOMETHING THAT REALLY SOLIDIFIES IF EARNINGS GROWTH IS 10% EX  ENERGY AND EARNING GROWTH 5%,  THAT'S A GOOD REASON TO BE  OWNING EQUITIES. >> IS THE FED LESS SIGNIFICANT  RIGHT NOW WITH THEIR RATE CUT? I DON'T CARE. THAT'S NOT WHAT I BASE THE  MARKET'S GOING TO DO. ARE PEOPLE STILL DYING FOR  ANOTHER COUPLE OF CUTS OR I  THINK WE'VE BEEN LUCKY TO HAVE  GOT TEN WHAT WE'VE LREADY GOTTEN AND HOPE INFLATION DOESN'T COME  BACK.  >> I AGREE WITH YOU. I THINK THE BEST CASE IS THE FED DOING ONE CUT BECAUSE THE  ECONOMY'S STRONG ENOUGH AND THEY ARE STILL DOVISH. THEY WILL MAKE THEIR WAY TO  NEUTRAL. IF THEY PUSH THE CUTS TO 2026  AND 2027, THAT'S A LONGER RATE  TO SUPPORT MARKETS. PART OF THE HESITATION IS WE  HAVE THE NEW ADMINISTRATION  STARTING. >> WHAT? OH, THAT'S RIGHT. >> YES. YOU KNOW, ESSENTIALLY, WE  REVERSED THAT RALLY OVER 23  TRADING DAYS AND NOW WE'VE GIVEN UP 5% AND ANOTHER 2% WOULD ON  ROUND TRIP US. >> 23 TRADING DAYS.  >> YES. >> DO YOU THINK STOCKS LOOK  EXPENSIVE HERE OR NOT? WE'VE COME BACK DOWN AS YOU  MENTIONED. PEOPLE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE PE RATIO AND HOW IT IS HISTORICALLY AT THE HIGH END OF THINGS. DO YOU THINK WE HAVE THE  EARNINGS POWER TO SUPPORT ALL OF THAT? >> TO ME, THE TEN-YEAR EVEN IF  IT GETS TO 5%, IS A 20 PE  MULTIPLE ON A TEN-YEAR BOND. THE MEDIAN PE IS 17 TIMES. I THINK STOCKS ARING GIVING YOU  MUCH BETTER VALUE THAN A BOND  RIGHT NOW AND 5% IS PROBABLY NOT THE LEVEL THAT YIELDS STAY. IT IS PROBABLY A DEFLECTION  POINT.  >> TOM, WHAT IS THE MOVEMENT IN  BITCOIN? IS THAT A SIGNAL OR A SIGN IN  ANY OF THIS ANALYSIS? >> STUPID FED. NOT CUTTING. >> BITCOIN IS DOWN ROUGHLY 15%  FROM ITS HIGHS WHICH FOR A HYPER VOLATILE ASSET IS A NORMAL  CORRECTION AND FOLLOWING GLOBAL  LIQUIDITY. WE ARE EARLY IN THE HALVING  CYCLE. OUR TECHNICIAN THINKS 70,000 IS  WHERE WE MAKE A STAND. I THINK BITCOIN IS ONE OF THE  BEST PERFORMING. >> YOU THINK IT GOES DOWN TO  70,000 OR DO YOU THINK THAT'S  THE FLOOR IN WHICH CASE YOU  WOULD BUY AT THIS PRICE? >> ONE LEVEL WOULD BE 70. >> SAY THAT AGAIN? >> RETRACEMENT LEVEL. YOU PULL BACK FROM WHERE YOU  RALLY. 70 IS ONE LEVEL. IT COULD GO AS LOW AS THE 50s. BUT THAT'S AGAIN NOT A NEW  LEVEL. THAT'S WHERE IT TOUCHES BEFORE  IT BEGINS TO RALLY.  >> LET ME ASK YOU A DIFFERENT  QUESTION. FOR THOSE WATCHING NOT IN  BITCOIN ON THINKING OF BUYING  BITCOIN AT THESE PRICES, ARE YOU SAYING THIS IS A FAIR PRICE TO  GET IN OR ARE YOU SAYING WAIT  BECAUSE YOU FEEL IT IS GETTING  FARTHER DOWN? >> BITCOIN IS SOMETHING YOU NEED TO BELONG- LONG-TERM FOCUSED. IF THEY ARE TRYING TO TIME THIS, MAYBE THEY GET LUCKY AND IT GOES TO 70.",

I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS FOR HOUSING I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD EXPECT THAT LONG-TERM MORTGAGE RATES ARE GOING TO BE BETWEEN 6% AND 7% EVEN THOUGH SHORT-TERM  RATES WILL CONTINUE TO COME DOWN AND I EXPECT SALES TO PICK UP  DUE TO PENT-UP DEMAND THAT WE  HAD SITTING ON THE SIDELINES FOR THE PAST COUPLE YEARS AS BOTH  BUYERS AND SELLERS, EXCEPT WHERE RATES ARE ACCEPT THE NEW ORMAL AND WE HAVE TO MOVE. WE'RE SEEING ACTIVITY, EVEN IN OUR FIRM IN THE FIST COUPLE OF DAYS OF THE YEAR, IT HAS BEEN A  LOT. >> THERE WAS THIS NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS  SETTLEMENT EFFECTING HOW REAL  ESTATE AGENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY GET PAID TELL ME ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF  BEING AN AGENT NOW SINCE THAT  RULING AND HOW THIS NEW VENTURE  OF YOURS, I THINK CALLED REALTY  CO., FITS IN >> YES THE JOB OF BEING A REAL ESTATE AGENT HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL. IF ANYTHING IT HAS BECOME MORE TRANSPARENT, WHICH IS SOMETHING  THAT MYSELF AND OUR FIRMS HAVE ALWAYS PUSHED FOR, THAT YOU HAVE CLEAR COMMUNICATION WITH YOUR  CLIENTS, WHETHER YOU'RE HELPING  THEM ON THE BUY SIDE OR ON THE SELL SIDE. IF ANYTHING, MORE HOMES WILL BE  SOLD AS MORE PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT THE PROCESS IN WHICH THEY  PURCHASE THAT HOME THE AGENT, THOUGH, AS YOU THINK  ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS, RIGHT, THEIR COMMISSIONED, THEY'RE NOT  SALARIED, THEY LIVE AND DIE BY SELLING THIS HOME OR THAT HOME IF YOU SIGN A CONTRACT TO BUY A  HOME THAT CLOSES TOMORROW AND  THERE IS A COMMISSION AGREEMENT  THAT IS SIGNED ON A BUY SIDE OR  SELL SIDE, THAT'S HOW THEY'RE  COMPENSATED. IF IT CLOSES IN A YEAR, YOU  THINK ABOUT THE NEW CONSTRUCTION HOMES, THE TOWERS THAT WE SELL IN NEW YORK CITY, SOUTH FLORIDA, ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, SOMETIMES  YOU DO YOUR WORK AS A REAL ESTATE AGENT, YOU WORK 15 HOURS  A DAY, YOU DON'T ACTUALLY GET  PAID FOR THAT WORK, UNTIL IT CLOSES SIX MONTHS  ER FROM  YEAR FROM NOW OR SO.

              "Some potential merger news in  the energy sector. Reports say constellation energy is in advanced talks to acquire  calpine for $30 billion. Natural gas prices are popping again as cold weather grips the  eastern u.s. Investors weighing uncertainty and energy production after  president-elect trump promised to do away with the biden  administration's offshore oil  and gas development ban. Joining us now is bill perkins it is great to have you on happy new year man -- >> great to be back. >> nat gas has been ripping. >> we finally got some cold  weather. The producer showed some discipline cutting back supplies and we didn't get into a containment situation until  november, where there was warm weather. With the cold weather, that  really means a lot to producers, not just for winter pricing, but for the entire injection season. That makes a lot more space for  gas to go into the ground, so  we're less worried about prices  dropping precipitously that should improve their cash flows and their ability to grow  production into the year.  >> okay. How much of this now hinges on weather and that draw down on  supply that is in storage. How much of this is tied to  policies with a new  administration coming in and potentially more lng exports as  in europe we're seeing some  changes with ukraine, russia,  lng deal going away? >> in the short-term and intermediate term it is all  about the weather. Market has been chopping around  with each run of the weather models it has been pretty exciting in the front. A little bit longer term, policy starts to matter, infrastructure starts to matter the facilities are ramping up, whether they ramp up on time or  early. We're hearing reports of plaquemines facility two months  earlier than expected. That adds to the demand picture. And you mentioned about calpine  being bought by constellation, that's all on the a.i. Data  driven demand that is out there. Electricity demand is  skyrocketing much more bullish than anticipated 12 months ago,  six months ago it seems insatiable right now. And so people are looking to take advantage of that so longer term policy  infrastructure matters more. >> yeah, bill, talk to me about  policy president-elect trump has been promising to boost energy supply as a way to reduce inflation is that a threat to energy prices how do you factor it in? >> well, i mean, if you remove the barrier tax on federal lands, speed up permitting, a  lot of it is just delay with permitting reform on federal lands and longer term, producers will respond to that and have  much more supply that will be bearish signal for  longer term prices it takes quite a bit to ramp up  a program, a drilling program, so i wouldn't expect that to affect things in the coming  year, but perhaps '26, '27, '28  we can see a slightly more robust supply picture. >> and now what about m&a? a lot of industries getting  excited about the prospects of the limits coming off on that in energy besides this calpine  thing we're hearing about today. Should we expect more of that? >> yeah, especially the permian. There is some good producers there, great acreage, efficiency of drilling is going up. And access to the market, we're  seeing new pipelines come out of there that are removing  bottlenecks. There is a macro story of  electricity demand going on that is going to play out over  several years unless that bursts somehow. And so i would expect some of  the larger players to look for strategic acquisitions in the  electricity side, generation side and also on the fuel  production side. >> how important is nat gas  going to be as this bridge builds toward nuclear, other alternative and sustainable  energy sources that have been  talked about, but haven't been realized in a meaningful way yet? >> yeah, i think it is going to  be very important. It has been very important our missions in terms of co2 or  particulate or any type of pollution per megawatt generated on an absolute level have gone largely in part of because of  the efficiency of natural gas  generation and lower polluting of natural gas we pretty much destroyed the amount of coal burned in this  country and it has done  wonderful things for people's  life expectancy and health and clean air. And so we have this abundant resource called natural gas here in the united states of america, loosenin",

              "So this is a new ceo being named as of liberty media. Back over to you.  >> julia boorstin, thank you.  >>> treasury yields capturing  plenty of attention on wall  street lately. The ten-year yield touching its  highest level since april  earlier today. Our next guest says the rise in  yields could be a false flag let's bring in fundstrats head of research tom lee, also a cnbc contributor. Tom, good to see you let's start there with the yield impact what might be people be reading  wrong, do you think? >> well, i wouldn't say markets  are necessarily reading it wrong, but i would say as  uncomfortable as we are seeing yields at near one-year highs, i don't think that this is going to be the level we see a few months from now and i think  that's more important because  ultimately if yields begin to  fall, because inflation  pressures are easing or if the job market is a bit softer than  expected, it really puts the fed put back in focus. So, i guess what i would just  say is it is not comfortable to  be here where yields are, i  don't think it really breaks markets, but i don't think yields are necessarily moving  higher over the next few months. >> well, it is particularly  uncomfortable, arguably, for small caps early last year probably around  this time you made a bold call on how much small caps could rise you moderated from that since. But where do you see small caps  going now? why didn't the big pop that you  projected for '24 pan out? >> yes, small caps have been disappointing. I mean, unfortunately i think  there has been a rug pull on those names a few times. I think investors are going to be very wary but to us, i think  the road map for 2025 is still one where the opportunity for  stocks to have much better breadth widens because not only  do we have an income administration that is pro business and i think it is going to boost ceo confidence, it is pretty evident now even seeing it in both ism readings  recently, but that's going to be a better environment for mergers, so, to me, while small  caps have been big laggards, actually for the last ten years, this ten-year underperformance to the the s&p is the worst in almost 100 years so second only to 1998 and then from a valuation  perspective, small caps are  still much more attractive, the  median pe is around 11 times,  that's seven turns cheaper than  the s&p. So, it has been tough, jon, to be overweight small caps, but i  think they're going to work in 2025 >> okay. I want to get your thoughts on some of the riskier assets or  the riskier parts of the market  that are -- i'll use the word  maybe potentially more speculative. Case in point, the quantum computing stocks, they had a huge move higher jensen huang from nvidia comes out yesterday, makes comments  saying that, you know, some of the super computers are still  and the full i guess realization of super computers is still  decades away and you see all the stocks tumble there is one that you like in  your granny shots here i believe ion q. Want to get your thoughts on what we have seen and some of  these parts of the market and  how to think about investing, if you should be investing in some  of these more speculative or futuristic frontier tech-like  companies. >> i think investors do need to  put a long-term lens on a lot of these important megathemes i think quantum computing is in  the earliest days. I don't think anyone can judge really whether it is 15 years  away or 15 months. And i think people have made many mistakes over the past 20 years looking at things like social media and underestimating the adoption rates there or  internet or even a.i. Now. Just think about two years ago how many people were saying a.i. Was going to actually take far longer than expected that being said, i do think the  environment for stock hasn't been great for the last three  weeks. I think it has gotten people into a recency bias thinking we  are near the top or stocks are just awful now i think we're getting close to the point where you should be  betting really and leaning heavily against that even look at a.i. Sentiment, it  is almost back to negative but, morgan, regarding quantum specifically, it is ",

              "For investors. >> energy trader bill perkins  joins us with his take on the  big swings for natural gas and how frigid weather, trump energy policy and geopolitics are impacting the commodities  markets. First to today's market action with courtney garcia and daniel  skelly it is great to have you both here, especially as we did have  the s&p basically eek out a  gain, though barely. More situation for the dow and the nasdaq but, courtney, just in terms of  how important yields are to the  equity picture, is that really what is driving things right now or is this a situation where there is a lot of sitting on your hands and waiting earnings  and other key catalysts like jobs later this week >> it is probably a little of  both when looking at the markets, especially today, a lot of that  is due to what is happening with the treasury and and inflation   going to continue to be a  headline that we're looking for. It did come off some of the  highs. You're seeing the markets have kind of recovered as the treasury has come down but really what the bond markets are continuing to tell you is  that inflation is likely going to be an issue you're going to start to see this peak in, goods deflation is slowing and you're starting it see inklings of inflation  continuing to peek its head here and that's where the markets are trying to see where the things are going because if interest  rates keep flying and inflation  is a problem, that is going to continue to be a problem in  2025.  >> you talked about this idea of a goldilocks view. You've written about widening  tail risks so, where do you see those risks and how do you prepare for them? >> sure, morgan, we're looking at a bit of a paradox this year  within markets in terms of an  unstoppable force, which is the  idea of u.s. Exceptionalism that everyone wants to invest here  and we got some of the leading secular themes meeting an  unstoppable object of u.s. Valuations and potential earnings and interest rate and inflation challenges and so the net effect of that  paradox is just a choppier first half to this year. And so as you were talking about earlier, we need to see more clarity on earnings expectations being met or exceeded and more information around the nature of tariffs, universal or select and what is the sequencing of  tariffs vis-a-vis the policy regulations. >> you say investors can buy cheaper valuations than the  megacaps, than the mag 7 with  high earnings growth you say you see opportunities in europe talk to me about how to approach europe when as dan mentioned there is a lot of focus on the u.s. Economy, on u.s. Stocks as  being attractive what kind of value do you see in europe >> yeah, and don't get me wrong  here, we absolutely still want to own the u.s and the question is the  magnificent 7 going to continue  to lead with the same kind of  outperformance it has been that's where i'm not sure it is. We're going to continue to own those things but those things are done really well, it is a good time to take  some profits, bring it back to your target. That's where with the profits  what areas do you want to look at that's where you look at things  like industrials, materials, both had negative to flat  earnings growth in 2024. Look at 2025, the earnings growth expectations are expected to be upwards of 18% and obviously much cheaper than  those mag 7. That's where taking some of the  extra money, putting it there  can be an opportunity. And europe also is significantly cheaper than the u.s., trades 13 times versus 22 times here in  the u.s. But the energy specifically in europe is even more dramatic,  about 50% discount to u.s. Shell, for example, trades about 8 times forward earnings or  exxon is like 14 tim",

IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> THANK YOU.  WHAT DO I WANT TO DO HERE WITH THIS TECH TRADE WHICH I LIKE WAS ASLEEP AND NOW I FEEL LIKE IT ROARED BACK AND NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE  I SEE RISING RATES AND SOME OF THESE ARE ROLLING PRETTY HARD. >> IT HAS BEEN AN UNCOMFORTABLE  START TO THE YEAR. I FELT LIKE WE WERE OFF TO THE RACES AND ALL OF A SUDDEN  PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO DOUBT AGAIN. WHAT WE LOOK BACK IS THE FUNDAMENTALS.  FIRST, ARE THESE BIG CAP TECH  NAMES THAT EXPENSIVE?  ARE THEY OVERPRICED? NVIDIA IS TRADING AT 32 TIMES. A BIG GROUP OF THE MAD 6,  EXCLUDING TESLA. IT IS NOT CHEAP. I DON'T THINK IT IS EGREGIOUSLY  EXPENSIVE. AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE REST OF THIS YEAR, I STILL DO HAVE  PRETTY GOOD CONFIDENCE THAT THE  A.I. TRAIN IS ALIVE AND WELL. I THINK NVIDIA WILL CONTINUE TO  WORK AND MICROSOFT AND META--- META ARE THE NAMES THAT YOU CAN  OWN. >> YOU DID NOT SAY APPLE.  CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT FROM YOUR LIST.  BASICALLY, THE MOVE FROM WWDC  TO CLOSE TO NOW WAS PUMPED,  BASED ON NOTHING THAT HAD TO DO  WITH ANYTHING WITH FUNDAMENTALS.  >> I THINK IT IS HARSH BUT I THINK IT IS ALSO PROBABLY FAIR AND THE REALITY FOR APPLE IS THIS.  THERE IS THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF THESE COMPANIES WITH A.I.  AND APPLE HAS SHOWN THAT THEY  ARE DIPPING THEIR TOES INTO  A.I. BUT THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN US ANYTHING YET OF SUBSTANCE THAT SHOULD MOVE THE NEEDLE IN TERMS  OF SHOWING PEOPLE I HAVE TO  UPGRADE MY iPHONE. WE WON'T GET ANY MORE SUBSTANCE  FROM THAT UNTIL THIS YEAR'S  WWDC.  THAT IS A KEY EVENT FOR THEM.  >> SO WE HAVE TO WAIT AGAIN. YOU ARE NOT COUNTING ON AN UPGRADE CYCLE. RATHER THAN ONE BIG EVENT, IT  JUST BECOMES THIS ROLLING DEAL THAT WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH?  IT WILL JUST TAKE YOU LONGER TO  GET TO THE DESTINATION YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE.  >> I THINK THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT. THE BAR IS LOW BUT I ALSO THINK  THAT APPLE, EVEN IF THEY DON'T GET THE A.I. TAILWIND, THEY HAVE EASY COMPS.  THEY HAVE DONE ENOUGH WITH A.I.  AND OTHER UPGRADES TO THE  iPHONE 16 THAT THEY CAN BEAT THAT LOW BAR.  THE QUESTION IN MY MIND, WHEN  GETTING EXCITED ABOUT APPLE IS,  WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE FOR NEXT  YEAR?  CAN THEY EXCEED AND GET BACK INTO THAT STRONG DOUBLE-DIGIT  KIND OF GROWTH?  WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT IN A LONG  TIME.  THE PEOPLE HOPE THEY CAN ACCELERATE TOO.  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WILL BE  THAT CAN DRIVE THAT KIND OF  GROWTH UNTIL LATER THIS YEAR.  >> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS BACK UP IN RATES IN GENERAL? ARE YOU CONCERNED IT WILL  DERAIL WHAT WILL BE A PRETTY GOOD MARKET HEADING INTO THIS  YEAR?  >> WE USE A.I. AND INTELLIGENT ALPHA TO MAKE  PREDICTIONS ABOUT HE MARKET. ONE OF OUR PREDICTIONS OF OUR  TRIO THAT WE USE PREDICTED THAT  THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR WOULD  HAVE A 10% LABOR OF CORRECTION.  WHAT IS SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT  WAS THAT WE MAY HAVE A RECURRENCE OF INFLATION AND  THAT MAY RESULT IN SOMETHING THAT MAYBE LOOKS LIKE WHAT WE  ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW WITH  RATES BECOMING MORE STABLE,  MAYBE EVEN RISING A LITTLE BIT.

Okay, i am done. >> very clever.  as always, kristina  partsinevelos, thank you.  >> kevin simpson is back.  he is the cio and founder of capital wealth planning. We think we have figure this all out. Let's try this again.  nvidia, you did what the other day? >> yesterday, scott, we tried  to harvest to the volatility that we saw in the free market.  we wrote a call expiring this  friday.  for three days, the option brought in one dollar per  share. It is a $147 strike. It gives us a little bit of  upside.  if you annualize out the premium, this is a fun thing to  look at. It is 60% annualized premium.  when you have markets like this  that are volatile, that are  shocking, to your point, we  will not sit on our hands and  we will try to harvest the volatility.  we have seven dollars to the upside and two days left in the  option.  >> j.p.  morgan trade was what? >> a little bit more boring. This one expires in two weeks. Is is our dividend strategy. The stock bottomed out around  230 in mid december and it has come up around 242.  we have $12 of upside potential  over the next two weeks but it brought in $1.10 and when you  annualize that out, it comes up  to an 8% annualized premium and  that is what we look for in our  main strategy. The nvidia trade is super fun  to look at but if you look at  these blue-chip companies and  you can generate an extra 5% or  6% a year in option premium, it  can really help, especially in a year like 2025 where things  might just not automatically go  to the moon again. >> what did you do with robin  hood?  >> this is in our growth strategy also. This was a final trade on  friday with the halftime report.  this is a stock that started off with the pandemic as a meme  trading thing. Cryptocurrencies, things like  that.  they are really maturing and they are looking at the long term plan in wealth management.  they recently bought a firm  called trade pmr which services  the custodian shift.

Rapidly rising rates and the future of this rally.  let's bring in cnbc  steve lee smith and bryn.  i will go to you first.  big of a story is this now for the market?  >> i don't think it will be a  big story three months from  now. I think maybe we move a little bit higher.  we have seen these numbers before.  we saw them in 2024 where we almost touched 5%. I think we will get a settling out after the inauguration.  we have some more understanding  around the policies and what actually will happen or the  potential to happened but i  think the bond vigilantes are  sniffing out.  the economy is strong. We have lots of unknowns from  the new administration that  seems on the surface to be inflationary.  as we get rates to be higher,  it will be a great opportunity.  i don't think they will be there by the end of the year.  >> the problem, steve, is not  so much the level, it is not that we did not think we would be at this level when the fed  started cutting rates in september. I am wondering how much you  think the fed itself has been  caught a bit off guard by all  of this. >> i think they weren't  expecting this.  i would have expected, scott,  that the improvement that we saw from april through september, maybe we had  overdone it a little bit but right now, we have round tripped that.  if you look at the 10 year over  that period of time, it is interesting that the stocks  have remained buoyant from that  pressure and i think it does shift the risk around a bit  which is this notion that we thought we were out of the woods on that refinancing thing  because rates have come down but there is a lot of debt that  will be rolling over from the  pandemic.  i think i have to go back and  look at those charts again to  see if that is an issue that is  worth exploring in terms of  risk to the system out there.  people thought they would refi and that gets to the heart of  your question. People thought they would refi lower rates and now they will  refi at the same rate they were  at before. >> bryn, you make an interesting point that you think this soon will pass. Three months from now, this  will not be a problem. To steve's point,  a.b.  stocks have not completely fallen out of bed because it presumably what you think is the reason that this will all  be okay. A lot of optimism about what this will bring. >> on steve's point about  refinancing, i think around 20%  of our debt, that is the market.  the fed cannot control the market.  as it relates to refinancing,  that might be a slight positive  because the rates have come  down on the lower end. I do think that your assessment  about right now, the market is getting the benefit of the doubt that rates won't stay at this level but for certain sectors like for small caps, everyone was so bullish. If rates stay at this level, i don't think we will see the  traders moving into those small- cap names as more interest rate  sensitive names. I still say stay at the cap  structure if you are going to  do a broad-based pla",

              ">>> welcome back.  it's time for today's three- stock lunch, and here with our trades, mr. Michael farr.  chief market strategist at hightower adviser, and of  course, a cnbc contributor.  first, chevron.  we heard a little bit from the ceo earlier today. The entire interview is at cnbc.com/pro,  and michael, you  say to buy chevron?  >> i say buy chevron.  thanks for having me, and  congratulations on this great  show.  kelly, this is awesome.  yeah, chevron's great and it's a must-see interview on  cnbc.com.  you've got to watch it.  this is a 4.35% dividend, it is  a fabulous balance sheet.  oil is sort of stilts hello -- still below its normal range.  anywhere around this 2.5% to 3%  for 2025, i think these oil  companies are a safe dividend  play.  it will be pretty good.  >> we don't have a lot of time,  but let's mention at&t, which  had a nice year last year. Do you like it?  >> no. It's okay, kelly.  i mean, at&t is fine.  so, how do you buy it now? you love the dividend. It's been great. At&t is a stalwart.  i don't have a problem with it.  as a whole, i can kind of do it, but i can't see where they will  come up with big growth for  this year. >> it's only up 20% on the year  anyways. >> compared to palantir, the hottest stock. 340% gain. It's down a couple of percent  this year. What do we do with palantir, michael? >> okay. If you all promise not to tell anybody, i bought the stock in may. Just between us. I bought it in may, and my personal account, because my brilliant son robert said, dad,  i like the stock, you should buy some.  i did not buy enough, needless to say.  i tripled my money in six  months.  i have sold 80% of my position,  maybe more.  it's about tha",

              "Demand that and will pull the  stock up like it has the past  two years. >> we watch all of that. Bryn, thank you. That was bryn talkington.  we will go to the broader  market now.  the doubt  is positive, albeit barely.  kevin gordon of charles schwab joins me now.  nice to see you. >> what is your read on all of this as you have listened to our conversation?  >> i love weprin was just  talking about in terms of when you get stretch valuations and you get hot sentiment and then it flips on the switch.  it can send a name or an industry or stocks in other  directions and that brings me  to a theme we have had for a couple of quarters now,  especially heading into 2025 where when you look at sentiment environment and 24, a  lot of the etrics that we  track were stuck in extreme  optimism territory for a big chunk of the year. You only had a few eriods  where it was early april to  late april in the midsummer  drawdown where some of that got  washed out and then it came  back very quickly. The environment and the ground is a little bit shakier heading  into this year because you had gone through a really long stretch of it being in extreme optimism territory.  it is not a reason in and of itself for stocks to sell up automatically but when you have  that shaky foundation and you  have a little more vulnerability, it opens you up to more of a draw down when you  have a negative catalyst.  >> do you feel like you are on the precipice of a narrative switch, of a sentiment change? as we also discussed with bryn and  steve liesman to start the  show, there is optimism about  what will happen despite some  of the concerns about  sticky  inflation and escalating deficit. >> the problem is you have these cross prints.  from a policy standpoint you have less change in regulation,  maybe a rollback and regulation, something that is  more beneficial from a tax policy standpoint but there is also a tiding mismatch because you have a regularly aggressive  tariff policy and you have a relatively aggressive  immigration policy that is being proposed.  it is human nature to look at  all of these proposals and take  them at once and say, here is  the ultimate it will happen but  we know that is not the case.  that is the benefit for  investors and probably the benefit for the economy for  most of this year if not all of  this year where if you exclude tariffs, everything from an  immigration standpoint takes a longer time to implement especially for taxes.  that is not something that the president can do unilaterally. That is why we are focusing a  lot more on what could happen  from a tariffs standpoint and  from an immigration standpoint but probably tariffs gives you that first hit and then  immigration falls under. You have to look at the suit can sing and what the result is  and from a growth standpoint --  maybe it is a little bit more  of a contrarian view but i think that the risk is more on the growth side, not as much on  the inflation side unless you  get significant retaliation  from other countries and you go  into a full-blown trade war. The tariff increase itself is  more of a one time price increase.  i would look from a cap x  standpoint and see if that materially slows and takes a hit. >> investors are a little  spooked by the move in rates.  are you? >> not as much.  right now, it is consistent  with a relatively healthy  growth backdrop. It is not like we have seen  some fall in estimates for gdp growth heading into this year  or even at the end of last year.  if you have for some reason the  material weakening in the labor  markets, friday's jobs reports are really weak and then you have some heat from cpi and  therefore cpe, i would grow  more concerned.  one of the reasons that you  haven't seen as steep of a selloff even as the rate of  change in something like the 10  year has really picked  up and you are getting closer to 4.7  and breaking closer to 5%, one of the reasons is that because the growth backdrop is relatively sparse. >> you have to keep in mind  too, if you take a longer look at the 10 year, in the sense of  the last three to four years,  you have gone through these  spouts, most notably the july  to october 2023 period where the 10 year did get up to 3% for a hot second and then a  reversed.  when you get to that point, you  have significant pullback in the market.  over that time, we have been able to move higher, not without a lo",

              "According to the federal reserve, guys, and this is why they have telegraphed they will  be slowing the pace of easing  in the coming year.  >> steve, stick around.  for more reaction to the fed minutes, the interest rate, the  macro economic environment,  let's bring in seth carpenter, chief global economist at  morgan stanley.  your take on the headlines that  steve gave.  >> unsurprisingly, steve did a great job. Look, i think the facts are  clear. The u.s. Economy is still on pretty solid footing.  the labor market had cooled, but was by no means cold, and  inflation keeps coming down, but there is noise, and there  are lots of ratings in recent  months that gave some of the members of the committee pause.  what is the central bank to do after you have cut interest  rates a lot and you don't know what the neutral rate is?  they ask themselves, how much  further do we have to go, and  they are inclined to keep going. We just heard on the wire, a speech from chris waller.  they are inclined to keep  cutting rates, they just don't want to overdo it. They are doing this balancing  act, and the fact they are getting closer to where they need to be, it is showing  through in this dispersion of  use, and just how much faster  and further they have to go. >> well, answer your own question, because i think it's confusing to a lot of people and by a lot of people -- i'm  referring to myself. In september, the federal  reserve cut rates by a half a  percentage point, 50 basis points, and we have been talking about the pace of rate cuts from the end of last year and all of this year, and all  the bond market has done is  react in the exact opposite  way, and bond yields continue  to spike, so i think the technical term is, somebody  screwed up.  >> i want to be a little bit more sympathetic to the really difficult job that jay powell  and his colleagues have. They are reading the data  coming in in real time.  they are inferring from the  real-time data what they have  to do. We were a little bit surprised by the 50 basis point cut, the soft readings in the labor market.  we thought, at the time, or  exaggerating what was going on,  but the fed did not want to  take any chances at that point,  and as they were just starting to lower interest rates, they  knew they were further away  from neutral.  if you are going to make a bit of a mistake, that would be the  time to, perhaps, cut a little bit more, so i think they were doing risk management. One of the paragraphs in the minutes that just came out was all about the risk management  discussions. Now, they are reading the  incoming data and asking, how  far do we have to go?  our view is, probably two more rate cuts this year. The economy will slow, but not crash for a while. There is huge uncertainty, though, about what will happen with tariff policy, as steve alluded to, what is going to happen with immigration policy,  as well? all of that uncertainty means  they can't be confident in how far they have to go. >> i guess, steve, the point is, there were a lot of people hoping that rates would go down  so they can afford a mortgage  to buy a home, and they heard  rate cuts, and they probably automatically assumed that rates would go down, and they  did go down, by the way. Maybe, they did something in september, but if they didn't, you thought, i will wait and rates will keep going down, but  they have not gone down. Is there anything you have seen, or somebody you talked to, that can explain why the fed is cutting while bond  yields are soaring?  >> brian, that's a great question.  reading these minutes, the 23  minutes that we get to read them , i was struck by the idea that  this did not, generally, read  like the set of minutes from a meeting where you would cut  interest rates.  unless, you are good, darn sure  that you are above the neutral rate and restrictive.  there were parts of this thing that you could read, like two  thirds of it, that would read  like the kind of minutes for a meeting, where they either held  the policy rate the same, or even raised the policy rate. It was a very unusual situation  when you look at the discussion  about the possibility of inflation stalling, when you look at the uncertainty around fiscal policy that is coming from trade and immigration.  you are right in the sense that  the rate cut was a little  unexpected by some people, and then you have people in the  room there.  we got some of that when we  look at the dock bought, as  well, but there was more than  one person in the room but did not want to hike rates.  not everybody got the vote, and  there may be some people that  voted for the rate cut, that did not think it was the best  course of action, may have gone  a long with the majority on  that, but you are right in the sense that we thought rates  were going to go down. If you look at that chart of the 10 years since september,  they have gone straight back up,  but the key here that i think is important for the fed and maybe seth wants to comment  on thi",

WILL RISING YIELDS TO BE A BIGGER PROBLEM FOR THE MARKET  IN 2025? JEFF KILBURG IS FOUNDER AT KKM FINANCIAL AND CNBC CONTRIBUTOR.  ALL RIGHT, DAVID, TAKE IT. WHY ARE STOCKS SHRUGGING OFF THESE MOVING RATES?  >> I THINK WE HAVE TO FACTOR IN, WHY ARE YIELDS GOING HIGHER?  THE DRAWING ON THE BOARD DEMONSTRATED CERTAIN PERIODS OF  TIME WHERE YIELDS WERE GOING UP  OR DOWN BASED ON EXPECTATIONS  OR FED POLICY, OR BASED ON INFLATIONARY PRESSURES.  THAT WILL HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON STOCKS.  MOST RECENTLY, YIELDS HAVE BEEN  GOING UP BASED ON GROWTH EXPECTATIONS.  IF YIELDS ARE RISING BASED ON  GROWTH EXPECTATIONS, WE CAN GET  MORE COMFORTABLE AROUND  EARNINGS GROWTH. THAT IS POSITIVE FOR STOCKS. IF YIELDS ARE GOING UP BECAUSE OF DEFICIT CONCERNS, OR BECAUSE  OF INFLATIONARY CONCERNS, YOU  ARE GOING TO SEE STOCKS FALL.  REALLY, IT'S A FUNCTION OF WHAT  IS DRIVING YIELDS, HOWEVER, I  WOULD SAY THAT OVER TIME, LOWER  YIELDS FAVOR THE EQUITY  MARKETS, PARTICULARLY, LONGER  DURATION EQUITIES LIKE THESE MEGA CAP TECH NAMES. THAT IS SOMETHING WE WILL HAVE TO GET USED TO.  WE WILL HAVE TO GET PREPARED FOR HIRE, LONGER-TERM RATES, HIGHER RATES ACROSS THE CURVE  AS RATES CONTINUE TO NORMALIZE.  >> JEFF, I LIKE THE STORY OF YIELDS RISING FOR GOOD REASONS,  AND IT HAPPENED IN THE LATE  1990s, BY THE WAY, BUT THE ONLY  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN  IS WE HAVE HUGE DEFICITS AND A BIG DEBT PILE. WHEN YIELDS ARE HANGING OUT AT 5% OR 6%, INTEREST COSTS ARE GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PAYMENTS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP HAVING  DEFICITS, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP HAVING A GROWING DEBT PILE, SO WE CAN BE AS COMFORTABLE WITH  IT NOW AS WE WERE BACK THEN  >> I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT,  KELLY. DAVID LAID OUT THE NARRATIVE.  HE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.  YOU CAN SEE EQUITIES MOVE  HIGHER WITH HIGHER YIELDS, IS  THAT THE STRONG ECONOMY. THAT WAS THE NARRATIVE IN 2024.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE LECTION  RESULT, PEOPLE GOT REALLY  EXCITED. NOW, AT 4.73 ON THE 10 YEAR, FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU SAW IT IN THE MINUTES, THE MARKETS ARE  QUESTIONING, WAS THE FED RIGHT IN CUTTING?  YOU WENT BACK TO SEPTEMBER,  THEY CUT 100 BASIS POINTS, AND THE 10 YEAR NOTE IS UP OVER 100  BASIS POINTS.  AS THE FED IS SNIVELING TODAY, YOU ARE SEEING SKITTISHNESS, CONFUSION. LOOK AT THE S&P 500. WE HAVE SEEN THE S&P 500 GO  POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, OVER A DOZEN TIMES. THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP, LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION.  FOR THE FIRST TIME, AS WE GET  CLOSER TO THIS 5% LEVEL ON THE 10 YEAR, PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING  MASSIVE PROFIT-TAKING OR REBALANCING, BECAUSE 2023 AND  2024 WERE HISTORIC EQUITY GAINS  BACK TO BACK.  AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME, IT SEEMS LIKE THE 10 YEAR NOTE MAY  GO TO 5%, AND THAT WILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN ACUTE REACTION  TO THESE HIGH FLYERS OR TOP 10 HOLDINGS ON THE S&P 500, WHICH YOU CAN EASILY ARGUE OUR WAY OVER CONCENTRATED. >> DAVID, WHAT WOULD OU SAY TO THAT?  >> I AGREE.  I THINK SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO  FACTOR IN, WHAT DO HIGHER RATES  MEAN FOR THE EQUITY MARKET?  I THINK THE PROBLEM TODAY IS THAT SOMEBODY PEOPLE ARE YEARNING FOR THE ULTRA LOW RATE  ENVIRONMENT WE SAW IN THE LAST CYCLE. BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT TO GO BACK TO THAT ULTRA  LOW RATE ENVIRONMENT MEANS THE ECONOMY HAS TO COLLAPSE. WE DON'T WANT THAT.  WHAT WE WANT IS NORMAL.  IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN  OVERNIGHT SENSATION WHERE  PEOPLE WAKE UP AND SAY, OKAY,  I'M OKAY WITH A 5% TREASURY  YIELD, I STILL WANT TO OWN EQUITIES.  YOU WILL SEE ALLOCATIONS INTO  BONDS AND MONEY MARKETS AS THESE THINGS HAPPEN, BUT OVER  TIME, THE NORMALIZATION OF RATES MAKES PERFECT SENSE. IT MAY SKEW YOUR PORTFOLIO A LITTLE BIT. ",

A lot of the real estate developers that we talked to, a  lot of them say that they are  turning to private credit for  financing. >> one of the megatrends, if we  want to use that word is the migration of more traditional  asset markets into the private markets. You are hitting on one of the  core themes that we see this year going forward.  we have one of the best in the business and lending.  the kind of lending you are  talking about properties and residential packages is exactly  what it provides.  i think direct lending is that we will see a similar migration  from those public markets into private markets offering large cap durable solutions. >> as you know, it goes where  it needs to. At some point, if people can't get a loan, it will turn to  private credit and say, at least this is an option. They have to hold capital. What about the private credit  world? >> we all focus entirely on  credit management. The key for us is that we have long-duration capital and we use very little leverage.  thankfully, we have been able  to originate over $100 billion of loans and have a 10 basis point realize loss basis rate. We have losses that sound more like ig losses.  however you will, the bottom line is unlike a bank, our money is locked up.  unlike a bank, we don't use  much leverage. Most importantly, we don't have  any depositors.  there is nobody standing behind  us.  this is private capital taking on a well-managed risk in the  hands of a professional  investor like blue owl appeared  as one of the banks in the financial ecosystem. They are complementary, but  structures are very different. >> that's interesting and we did learn from long-term capital management that if you are systemically important and i'm not saying that blue owl is  lt cm, but interns in terms of size, -- that's all i'm saying.  the other dynamic i'm thinking about a lot is interest rates. The higher rates are, the  better investors will do, but  can the companies afforded?  a lot of it is floating dead?  >> it is.  higher for longer environment, which has been what we have  anticipated candidly for the last 18 months and it's clearly  the consensus as a directional matter is very good for our  investors. You phrased the right question.  it's very good.  there is a level of interest bills and burden.  they are too troubling for them  to carry.  we stress tested that. The thing about private credit as we run a lot of years through a lot of different environments through covid, the  bank meltdowns, silicon valley bank, high rates and we have well over five and we tested the statements as the owners of  these businesses.  the great news is that it  works. They are durable to any current  rate levels or realistic bands around them. Surely, there is a version of  hyperinflation and rates that  would not be manageable, but i don't think we have a realistic  expectation. >> the growth speaks for itself. I am waiting for the big talks.  you know what's coming.  maybe not in the next couple of  years, but at some point you know it's coming.  >> we understand that and we know that it's transparent.  any regulator and the key point  is that we have capital that is  from a private group with  another private user and committed in much term to its  use. We really provide a stabilizing  force and not trying to  overstate this in a societal setting, but it's better to  maturation and risk and put it with private lenders.  >> like any new thing, the",

                "Microsoft said that google developed the quantum chip and it shares up more than 560% in three months and it is dead  wrong. That brings us to today's tech check. >>> joined by ceo alan baratz. Welcome to both of you.  >> it was google, indeed.  before we get to alan, a little  more context.  it stood at around $200 million  last year and shot up to nearly  $3 million after the breakthrough spurred a surge in  the sector and it's now down 40% on the session.  thank you so much for joining  us and making the time.  tell us what exactly huang, the  leading authority on the future  of computing is getting wrong  here.  >> thank you for the opportunity to be here.  i appreciate it. I think that he is a very smart  individual and has built an  amazing company. He may be the authority with many aspects of computing and  all aspects of computing and certainly not quantum computing. In this case, he's dead wrong. We are commercial today. We have companies like mastercard or pattison group that are using our quantum computers today in production  to benefit business operations.  not 30 years from now or 20  years from now or not 15 years from now, but today. Moreover, we have been able to solve problems on our computer in the area materials  simulation in minutes that would take well over millions  of years to solve on the fastest, which by the way have been massively parallel  computers. They should think a little bit about that.  we are solving problems in minutes and it would take  millions of years to solve them  on massively parallel systems  that he provides.  i would be happy to meet anytime and anyplace to fill in  these gaps.  >> i got the opportunity to get  to know him a little better  over the last month or so. Your  approach is very different than  what huang is talking about.   it's limited to optimization problems and you don't play in the same field. Is that  correct? >> no. When we say we are limited to  optimization, that is not an accurate statement.  we are very good at solving  optimization problems. Frankly, optimization represents most of the important problems that businesses need to solve, so we are proud of the fact  that our computers excel in  that area. That's not the only area we play.  we play materials simulation and we play quantum photography  and cybersecurity. We play in a  broad set of areas.  you are right. We have taken a different  approach from everybody else in  the industry and that is what  has allowed us to become commercial today.  >> what you just described sounds like what generative ai promises to do. Optimization promising relations et cetera. If the wave is offering better,  then why aren't you valued like  a a.i. Company?   why is it contracting in the latest quarter?  >> first of all, with respect  to bookings and revenue, all i will say is that our business  is actually growing nicely.  i am very forward --.  >> was there an exception? revenue was down 27% in your latest quarterly report. What happened? >> as i said, i'm looking  forward to sharing our fiscal  2024 financial and operating results when we report earnings. Stay tuned.  now, that having been said,  a.i. And quantum  are not competitive to one another.  there are some areas where you might be able to use both  systems and i talked about materials simulation, but we are so far ahead of what massively parallel gpu could do  in an area that i don't even do  that as competitive. When it comes to optimization, there are attempts to use it to  solve optimization problems. It's not necessarily their sweet spot and that is an area where i think d-wave  and  quantum computers excel. That is why we are working with  companies today to support their business operations. >> just to be clear, you are saying that it does play in the  same space that jensen is  talking about? i know that there is different approaches to computing and the  gate model.  i don't want to get into that. You are saying that huang  has it all wrong?  >> what i'm saying is that huang  does not understand what  you just said. There are different approaches to quantum. The two primary  approaches.  while his comments may not be  totally off base for model computers, there are 100% off  base for quantum computers.  >> we watched it back. From dead wrong to not totally correct. You walked it back a little bit. >> hold on.  when it comes to quantum computing, it's dead wrong.  we are not 30 years out or 50  years out, but we are today. We are supporting businesses today with quantum computers solve their heart problems.  in that sense, he's dead wrong.  there are approaches to quantum  computing that it will take  longer to mature",

                "Stocks have turned lower.  bond yields are pulling back,  but they were the highest we have seen, kelly, since april. The rate spike causing stocks  to sink. >> as we are saying this, we are back at 471 on the 10 year,  as we get the minutes coming out right now. Steve, do tell.  >> the federal reserve, at its december meeting, was at or  near the point, after cutting  by a quarter, of slowing its policy easing. The rate cut that they did enact was seen as, \"finely balanced.\" it was a finely balanced call, and some wanted to not cut at  all. That is more than just one dissent. Not everybody has the vote.  the minute say that the fed cut  rates to maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market, while continuing progress on inflation, because they believe they were restricted.  the risk between inflation and unemployment were seen as  roughly balanced.  inflation had eased  substantially, the remains somewhat elevated. What you will hear next is a lot of the back-and-forth of the meeting between those most concerned about inflation and  those less concerned.  the pace of the inflation, had slowed, some said. Upside risk to inflation had increased. Several were concerned that  this inflation may have stalled  or risked stalling.  on the other side, some people said this inflation was still  apparent across the board, especially, in market prices,  as opposed to the nonmarket  prices on a range of goods and services.  now, moving on, the firms we are seeing as more reductive to  increase prices, consumers were  more price-sensitive.  changes in trade and immigration policy.  now, a big discussion about  coming fiscal policy, it is  mentioned several times in the minutes. Policy could delay inflation improvement. The uncertainty of elevated -- also elevated the uncertainty  about policy.  there was rising business, optimism, however, and expectations for tax policy  changes, along with the  regulation.  positive market sentiment and  momentum into growth could put upward pressure on inflation,  and the fed was concerned about  knowing the difference between what was a temporary increase  in inflation, but that is the  implicatio",

Appreciate you bringing that to  us.  garrett. >>> has also been impacted by  the fires. He is on the newsline now with more details.  i don't know if you caught some  of that interview, but what is your experience? >> hi, kelly.  i did catch a bit of it. The area is devastated.  it's actually hard to believe, as you can see the images. So many of the homes are wiped out and completely destroyed.  most of the commercial area is gone and the fire went down to the beach. You have homes along  the beach and we have an area  with neighborhoods that are  just gone. The churches and schools are gone. What's amazing to me is  that in this day and age and we  have had record wins and certainly a terrible situation,  but in this day and age, it's  like a third world country and the fires continue to rage on. Last night, the reports that i was getting from my team on the  ground that were with  firefighters, the reports we that the fire hydrants were not  working. There was no water.  can you imagine? >> have you gotten any updated information? is that a major issue or any idea why that would happen?  >> what i was told and what was  reported to me that they mismanaged the reservoir supplying the hydrants and didn't refill it.  when i realized that they had a  problem, they could get it refilled in enough time. You have blocks being on fire  and the firefighters literally had to stand there and watch things burn down. It's beyond  negligence in my opinion.  we've got to get the community rebuild and support the  businesses.  of these homeowners that have  been devastated my daughter  lost her home and my son lost  his home. You get through all  of that, because you have to support the community, but some  tough questions need to be answered about how this happened and the leadership and the void  of leadership. Not just in the last couple of days, but the last couple of years. The public hillsides and mountains have not been managed  with the amount of brush that  created fuel that was just unstoppable and to have the  basic need of water. I just have to throw this out. I don't think this is the time that it should be on a global  trip.  the very basic needs of  leadership is to be present. I think there is real questions  that need to be asked about how  we manage the city and the budget of the fire department  was cut by the city council a  few months ago.  >> we have family and this is  an active situation. They are dealing with power  outages now and a fire spreading now. United said that they will reschedule flights no charge and no problem, but this isn't just about something that  happened last night and is over. >> that's exactly right. There are different pockets of l.a. County that have fires and it's  out of pasadena area.  the fire around continues to go  and it's moving towards  brownwood. We evacuated from our house, s",

Rates have backed up to all- time highs for the cycle and were 1800 points higher than we  were in october 2023.  >> that's right. The market and technology has  shown that they can withstand  the rise in rates. By technology, i am in cash  flowing elite technology.  mega cap, large-cap and leading  companies and a variety of industries.  which is where that phrase does  have merit.  look, interest rates have gone nowhere but up and tech has  been relatively resilient. We heard earlier about productivity. To some extent,  companies are getting wiser in the how they operate, but they are seeking out new ways and are using technology.  even in a slowing growing  economy, we think technology spend and capital spend will remain and that is another reason why we are resilient  with our belief that technology  is the best sector to be in. >> people might find it  interesting that you are doing that with etf, invesco and this  is not necessarily a mag seven play, but there have been a lot  of deal chatter the last couple  of days. You had shutter stock with a possible deal with the uniform space. It feels like we are starting  to get the drum be and that's  an area that you are focused on, as well, isn't it? >> yes, it is. We are overrating and  overplaying how much the new administration coming in will  matter, but not in this area.  we think that the market is  right and we think it's going  to be sustained if not supported by the incoming  administration.  it will be good for economic efficiencies and stock market. We know from the prior run how important that is to the trump administration.  we think that stocks are uniquely poised for this evaluations and and and a  related financial firms and  that is why we like the larger financial diversified capital  markets, because we do believe that there will be a boom and  it will be centered in those mid-cap companies across the board. Are you have vanguard, as well.  you like hilton and just returned to office, trouble  spend and lower cost efficiency.  i want to end on the defense sector over the years. This being the space where boeing has a little bit -- may be turning a corner that will  help.  you are not concerned by any headwinds? whatever might be coming from  doge and  that is an area that we keep hearing. We need to  spend more gdp.  >> part of my philosophy is to think about what's being said  and from the trump administration and what they are going to do. Cutting defense is not something they will do in a big  way and they will not cut  weapon systems not in the world  that we live in, plus there is a lot of proof about how technology is taking over the  war in ukraine.  i think we will look at  companies like boeing as real  leaders for our national defense.

                  "Turning to earnings starting next wednesday in earnest with financials i think that will be positive, and i think that will be the catalyst for us to move forward. >> moves you're making as a  result of what could be a game changer for the rally, most of what you're doing today, it  appears to me relates to outside the sort of derivative play, if  you will, of what higher rates are going to mean. You've loved the india trade for a while. Now you're bailing on it, it looks to me, in numerous ways, through the inda, one related to small caps and the other may be  larger cap stocks. >> yeah. Look, i made money on the trade, but i didn't make as much money  as i thought with the supply chain moving from china to india, which i still think will  occur. The element you've introduced  also is that there will be more  onshoring, which was a theme already and has been a theme for a number of years. I think that accelerates,  because again, we talk about trump being pro-business, but is it really pro-business if you  get a cowardly move by mark  zuckerberg on meta to say, okay, anything goes now. And then what are the  advertisers going to think they're not going to come out  like disney and say, hey, we're  not going to be on twitter anymore, because of this,  because you can't do that. That's not politically correct in a different way now but it is influencing how  businesses work. That's not -business that's going to a certain  narrative the administration wants. As part of that, i worry about tariffs coming from india. I don't worry about tariffs  making good business sense,  because you do need some extern",

                  "The pressure of upside yields  is over by a long shot.  back to you. >> appreciate it very much.  >>> just returned back to some market applications, j from  wells fargo, i know we are looking at the economic side of  things, but this is not an economic outlook and inflation to dynamic and fiscal dynamic. I don't mean bad, but as rates as it could be right now, what turns the tide?  >> what would turn the tide is you get good news in terms of  the inflation front. If you get a decent cpi print, that puts some downward  pressure on yields and another thing would be on friday when  we get to the deployment report  and a weak employment report.  people start to wonder, is the economy starting to soften here? i think it would be the  combination of weaker economic growth in terms of the economy,  as well as on the inflation  side that could potentially  turn the tide. >> you see a scenario. Does the size of the deficit factor in at all to the outlook  for next year? >> sure. We're talking about it in terms  of a cyclical sort of thing and  near-term sort of thing. Let's face it, the economy goes  into a hole sometimes soon and we are not going back down to  where the treasure yields were two or three years ago down  below 2% or something like that, so you could get a rally in  here where rates come back down  a little bit, but in order to  go back to those lows, we saw  them a few years ago and something really bad has happened to the economy just because the fiscal deficit now and debt concerns are so much  bigger than what they were even  a few years ago. >> steve, the adp number wasn't  that great this morning. If anything, yields went to the  highs after the reporting even though it was a mess and the expectation is around 150,000. That job support will be another chance for us to test  the market.  >> that's right. People are calling it the no higher no fire economy.  we will take a look, by the  way, at the challenger job layoffs data tomorrow morning  that we will get, which will give us a clue as to what's  happening. He saw the jobless claims down near a recent low just a tick  above 200,000. That's a pretty big deal.  we are not losing jobs, but not  gaining at the same pace.  that's kind of normal. The key from the fed standpoint  and shared several times that  the job market is not a source of inflation.  in fact, the job market could  be a source of disinflation  through the service sector is  indeed you have wages rising at  a slower pace. That's a good thing. Jay is absolutely right.   you need something to take the offer or bring the economy of  the boil in the sense that we  are not -- one good part about this that is not discussed a lot and they want to see the discussion in the minutes, kelly is the productivity story  that we talked about.  last week, this notion that you  have this upward move in productivity.  said it today what we said last  week, which is that it raises  the neutral rate and it does allow the economy to run hotter, but it is also a reason  why the terminal rate and sense  of where the tenure is should  be higher for that reason and  in that the fiscal deficit.  if you got a little clarity  about spending from the trump  administration and how they  were going to deal with fiscal issues, we might come up when  it comes to interest rates.  >> i agree.  i will give you last word on that.  what you think is going on with  productivity?  >> there has been some acceleration going on. Is it because of capital spending or technological  breakthroughs like ai or something like that? i'm not convinced that is  necessarily what it is, but it could be what going on, a  reflection of the tightness of the labor market over the last number of years. Business is out there and  realize that it's not like we  have workers just laying around  everywhere, but we've got to",

                  "bring in show music please hi I'm CNBC producer Katie Kramer today on squawk po many things are happening that are exciting very exciting for our country not even inaugurated and making big waves around the world he's not president yet so none of it is I know but but he's going to be in 12 days president-elect Trump on Annex in Canada in Greenland and the Panama Canal what do you take seriously axio say mark Caputo says pay attention to it all just in case by now we had what 12 13 years of this we should realize it's both you have to take them literally you have to take them figuratively you have to take them seriously and sometimes you have to take them UNS seriously plus the rest of today's stories that got us squawking like those big changes at meta we never wanted to be the Arbiters of truth that's always a hard position to be in Facebook's first general counsel Chris Kelly weighs in on the new approach to factchecking and moderation online more speech is the answer to difficult speech it's Wednesday January 8 2025 squawk pod begins right now stand Becky by in 3 2 1 C please good morning everybody and welcome to squawkbox right here on CNBC we're live from the NASDAQ Market site in Time Square I'm Becky quick along with Joe kernin and Andrew Ross sorin and let's see how things are shaping up we are watching a Quantum Computing stocks and let's tell you what's going on uh sinking and extended trading this follows some of those comments by Nvidia CEO Jensen Wong during a investor Q&A call he shared his outlook on the timeline for Quantum Computing advances take a listen kind of said 15 years uh for for uh very useful quantum computers uh that would that probably be on the the early side if you said you know 30 is probably on The Late side um but if you picked 20 I I think I think a whole buch of us would believe it and but what we're interested in is we want to help the industry get there as fast as possible he also issued a warning to companies who are building quote general purpose Computing he said the era of coding by hand is over he also said that every single data center is now going to be built differently with accelerated Computing and machine learning capable machines shares of Nvidia let's show you where that stands right now uh now at about $142 it comes after a 6.2% slide yesterday his uh product re ation was viewed as significant in long-term but lacking short-term upside According to some analysts including one at stifel meantime take a look at shairs of Palante here they fell as well about 8% 7 7.8% yesterday now down about 14% for the week on Monday night several funds from Cathy Wood's Arc Investment Management unloaded nearly 200,000 total shares of paler that comes as Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of paler with an underweight rating and $60 price Target uh on Monday the analyst said success is more than priced in with palter trading around 160 times earning and that stock at 6885 I mean it was I I think the one of the best performers last year in the S&P 500 if you look at what happened with that stock too so maybe not surprising to see a pullback after a much longer upward u March at least over the last and that was really a combination of just all of the geopolitical issues in the country plus then you in the world rather to say and then you add Trump on top in the election and I think there was a view that that paler would be a massive winner depending on how you think the dod budg and everything else gets recalibrated firefighters battling overnight against a wildfire that forced evacuations in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Southern California nearly 50,000 people have been ordered to evacuate and thousands more have been told to prepare to leave strong winds have fueled the spread carrying Embers that ignited spot fires throughout the region there isolated wind gusts as strong as 100 miles an hour were expected to hit the mountains and foothills overnight according to the National Weather Service those winds are expected to remain high throughout early afternoon today schools are shut across the LA metro area nursing homes have been evacuated you've probably seen the pictures at this point of what's been happening with people trying to evacuate trying to get out through one road uh being forced to abandon their cars and then bulldozers having to come push through those cars to get them out of the way so First Responders could get through some shots from inside people's homes people still in them nice houses yeah with flames whipping up around malib a lot of people at this point have been asked to uh to exit uh that entire area which I know pretty well a lot of you think of Malibu you think of you know the blue ocean but there are beautiful Canyons all on these beautiful Golf Course a lot of of uh great real estate kind of scary President elect Trump held a wide ranging uh news conference at Mara Lago yesterday among the highlights uh Trump slammed President Biden's restrictions on offshore drilling he promised to revoke the order on day one even if it requires going to courts Trump reemphasized uh his desire to bring Greenland under Us control he made the comments soon after his son Donald Trump Jr arrived with other representatives in Greenland yesterday Trump also slammed late uh former President Jimmy Carter for selling the us built Panama Canal to Panama he said the canal was currently under discussion when asked by a reporter if he could assure the world that he would not use milit military or economic coercion in his effort to bring Greenland in the Panama Canal under Us control Trump quickly said uh no Trump also said again he hoped uh to turn Canada into an American state arguing the US is paying far too much to its northern Ally said he consider using economic Force to bring the country under uh Us control said you were considering military force to acquire Panama and Greenland are you also considering military force to Annex and acquire no economic Force because Canada and the United States that would really be something I love the Canadian people they're great but we're spending hundreds of billions a year to protect it we're spending hundreds of billions a year to take care of Canada we we lose uh in trade deficits he later uh posted this image on true social with the comment O Canada outgoing uh Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on X that there isn't a snowballs chance in hell that Canada would become part of the US Elon Musk responded girl you're not the governor of Canada anymore so it doesn't matter the governor what you say right Governor Ken govern Trump's been calling him for a while governor of a state the thing but what do you think's going on here for real and I I just think it's a bit of the Trump Doctrine I I'm not going to spend a lot of time worrying about it and thinking about I like my hair I I want my hair to stay I'm not I'm not going to set it on fire every day uh like so many people what do you take seriously I guess is the I I take seriously that Greenland is a really strategic U piece of of land that if we could we've done it many times in the past it sounds ridiculous crazy now but Cobalt lithium graph fite uh ship shipping um uh areas an access to the Arctic which we're trying to right now claims control of it claim I know they do and so and Russia used to control Alaska and Russ sold us to it well that's what we're talking about I don't know we'll see what we'll see what happens as I said I'm not going to you know start ring you might take you might use military well he he didn't say he would he said he wouldn't rule it out wouldn't rule it out I don't know whether I believe as I said it to me it's you know it's this fire hose of information Chang news that you're trying to figure out and evaluate what is real and what is not what he takes seriously what's a negotiations you don't know what's negotiations you don't know what he's trying to set himself up as things are going to change in terms of our standing in the world you look at China and Russia you look at how uh you know they view Taiwan you look at what Putin's we're not not saying there's going to be an invasion of Ukraine or something like that but in a more in a world that uh maybe people have perceived America as being weak I think he's trying to at this point say things are you know there's I appreci Sher in town I appreciated the message he sent to Hamas yesterday at the same time which was probably the most significant thing saying if you don't have some deal that's put in place to release these hostages by the time I'm here all hell is going to break Lo but then the question is what what does all hell break loose to me to me the bigger issue is how do you prioriti yeah but how do you prioritize and how do you take Serious what was the red line and how do you how do you say this is what we really care about and and and by the way totally understand sending a message like that to Hamas why we would aggravate and irritate our Northern Partners who have been really good allies for a long time I would just put them in different camps that's what depend you know lean says trade deficits don't uh matter with other countries um Canada benefits greatly from and we benefit also natural pet I don't really think I don't take that as ser I think that's sort of just uh you know I think that's almost like tweaking it's almost like um I think so too but it's weird to have all of those things that you just spin after you hear every one of these presone I know but but he's going to be in 12 days then we'll we'll we'll look back I mean I I lived through the first four years I'm fine I think everybody else was everybody else was fine in the first four years I'm I'm not I got a different one for you what's up so during the press conference there's the whole conversation about Facebook is this going to be a good thing or another scary negative thing about Trump I don't know okay you go ahead all right I know you don't want we didn't do much of this during the Biden Administration but but go ahead what what are you worried about I'm not worried about something it's a business question about okay what a business leader or business will think in reaction to this so Mark Zuckerberg clearly um takes the side of the president changes this all the so many of the policies personnel as Dana White all this kind of stuff and suggests that he's doing this because he's he believes in this stuff and thinks it's genuine he's saying that he's right you saw him on yeah right he's saying it we're going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes simplifying our policies and restoring free expression on our platforms more specifically here's what we're going to do first we're going to get rid of fact Checkers and replace them with Community notes similar to X the fact Checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created especially in the US and by the way there's been a question about whether we meaning the public are supposed to think that he's you know kissing the ring or bending the knee or whatever then the president comes out and is asked is he doing this because of the threats that you have made to meta and he says this is the President says yeah probably meta Facebook I think they've come a long way I watched it the man was very impressive I watched it actually I watched it on Fox allowed to say that do you think he's directly responding to the threats that you have made to him in the past yeah probably and I wonder whether if you're sitting as a CEO in America and watching that you're saying he's not giving me credit for anything or is he going to give him credit for this that's the that is actually a very interesting question like they say you know I'm not worried about it it's Trump but in it no but this is actually the F for businesses free speech is one of the most important things that we have in the country and I want all companies to adhere to free speech and not censor things that they don't like like laptops and lab origins of of viruses and none of this stuff and immigr anything negative on immigration can't be on Facebook all these things were banned from Facebook so if Trump says I'm for free speech and I want all voices to be heard and then Zuckerberg says okay right I'm going to do what the president said by not what he said to to him he said that he was going to put him in jail the if you are violating key provisions of of what you know we believe in then these threats even though they may be complete hyperbole but I guess your question is what does it mean for CEOs and how will they behave well I think the question is I think there's a lot of people who've gone down to Mar Lago and have I mean let's call it they've kissed the ring right and they're hoping they're kissing the ring and and I think a lot of them believe themselves that they're kissing the ring for the right reason meaning that the they they actually changed their position or not or maybe we're give too much credit for that I don't know but then to have the president come out and say actually yeah he's doing it under direct except for that here's the difference the president wasn't reaching out and putting that on Truth social doing it unprompted a reporter asked him a question totally he answered honestly what by the way very honest answer yeah what a concept we haven't seen a lot of that uh but but it it it is interesting because I think there is this calculus that takes place in many corporate leaders heads trying to figure out how to how to na because this is what they do they navigate administrations here around the globe and this is them trying to different here's the presidency we're still under right now so this is the kind of this is what we hear from the guy who who's still in charge you want to talk about a snowballs Helen CH chance in hell he didn't have a snowballs chance he can he can barely put one foot in front of the other this was never going to well you I'm just saying I'm just say you got your guy you should be very happy I am happy but I want just wish we had the same micromanaging of everything that was done for the past four it was totally outrageous I just wish we would have had the same introspect from or U skepticism and looking at every that from the mainstream media that we're now having for this new Administration which isn't even in yet they got we talked religiously about how how this guy wouldn't take a meeting with CEOs in America and that was a problem we yeah after he finally couldn't put two words together in aate it didn't happen we've been complaining about that for four years on this show oh God he through he Biden got a free pass for four years we don't need to we don't well now you don't want to there was some great press coverage for the four years of trump nothing for the four years of Biden just like a free pass on the most outrageous stuff now we're going to be back to doing this every day that's why I say I like my hair I can't go through it again will be next still to come the reverberations of Facebook choice to do away with third-party fact Checkers we'll check in with the company's first Chief legal officer on this shift it's a return to a free speech tradition that we very much tried to respect even as we did more content moderation uh in the early days of Facebook this is squawk pod stand andby in 3 2 1 Q you're watching squawkbox on CNBC I'm Andrew R sorin along with Joe kernin and Becky quick got a whole bunch of big stories this morning perhaps couple of the biggies meta platforms announcing it's going to end its thirdparty factchecking on its services and move to user generated systems of check mark similar to the community notes program on X cbc's learned that some meta employees took to the company's in-house Communications tool to voice their displeasure although criticism didn't account for all of the posts one worker said it appeared meta was sending a message that facts no longer matter and conflating that with a victory for free speech joining us right now Chris Kelly Facebook's former Chief privacy officer and former general counsel he's the founder of Kelly Investments and let's just start with the basics what did you think when you first heard this announcement many ways it's a it's a return to a free speech tradition that we very much tried to respect even as we did more content moderation uh in the early days of Facebook um cleaning up the ability to communicate and being able to you know easily present one's views was a critical part of the network from the beginning and in some ways Mark Clearly feels that we've gotten away from that and uh this change is meant to effective where do you where do you stand on this issue and the reason I ask is you know I think there's a question as to where is has Mark's mind evolved or was this is always where Mark sort of head was and maybe with some of the people around him and I'm thinking of the Nick Kels and Cher Samberg and others that pushed him in another Direction what's the sort of genuine view of this well I I think you have to create a space that allows people to communicate effectively and that requires some ability to push back um in the American free speech tradition that is usually with more speech and not in in in taking you know too much down and we always we never wanted to be the Arbiters of of truth that's always a hard position to be in um you know but you have to make sure that that you know your community doesn't decline into a cesspool of of of accusations back and forth all the time and and and of the presentation of misinformation either um the AI tools that Facebook has deployed and meta has deployed over time on all of its networks still operate here and there will be um addressing of of child sexual abuse material of illegal content things like that a huge part part of the decisions in the past I would say were business decisions business decisions based on at least a view maybe wrongly but a view that advertisers uh wanted this kind of control over the platform or at least people were telling Mark Zuckerberg that the question now is whether advertisers will stick with the platform very interestingly I would argue to you that X now is obviously a much uh broader platform today in the to the extent that it's more free speech oriented but it hasn't necessarily worked uh as an advertising platform I I I do think that advertisers are continue going to continue to express their opinions and they're not going to want to have their brand advertising in particular appear um next to offensive material and and I think that that will continue to be a piece of pressure on the company um just as it is on X and on every other platform so I don't think that that this this will actually end up making a massive difference in your day-to-day experience on Facebook so you don't think it changes do you think that the experience on on X has changed I I I do think it has and and we'll see if that works for advertisers over time um I I think that there's some you know encouraging uh you know indications that that you know there's some adaptation that's going on I think the community notes feature is excellent and it's been implemented very well on what did you make I mean there was sort of an interesting moment yesterday during the the Trump press conference because you know on one side you saw Mark Zuckerberg take to Facebook and Instagram announcing all of this and I think uh making a a i I hope genuine argument I'm sure there are people who question how genuine it was but then of course later in the after and saying that he was doing it in part because he thinks that politically the the country has moved and then you know 3 hours later you have Trump being asked whether he's effectively doing this genuinely or whe whether he's doing this because of the threats that have come from Trump and he says yeah probably probably because he's doing it under duress I I did see that but I I do think and having been there in the initial discussions we always wanted to Hue to the American free speech tradition which is more speech is the answer to difficult speech um that that it was meant to Facebook is meant to be a place for discourse and the you know you know de emphasis of of political content and the ability to express yourself is something that that I I think that the there's some regrets around the way that that was implemented particularly um in the postco period how do you think this changes the regulatory story for meta meaning there there's there's a whole bunch there's a whole bunch of uh of of State well I don't know what you think is going to happen to the attorney generals but there's a whole bunch of of of regulatory issues that are around meta right now and the question is whether you think they disappear well I no I certainly don't think they disappear I think that there's going to continue to be a bunch of discussions and I think that the company has tried to to act very responsibly around addressing uh some of the worries about harm and self harm material that's presented online um some of the controls that they've tried to introduce particularly on Instagram and teen accounts and things like that um you know this has always been an incredibly complex problem um there isn't really a right answer at the end of the day unfortunately for the company or for uh everyone online you're dealing with expression which is a messy messy thing that uh uh you know sometimes people are you know expressing themselves in in ways that are are hurtful um to themselves or to others and you have to figure out a way to you know guide a discussion so that it's civilized and and that people get a lot of value you know that's one of the key one of the key things that they're trying to return to Chris Andrew and I were were having a question discuss yesterday I was thinking about it at home because Andrew was saying you you thought maybe section whatever it is 230 yeah that you should get rid of it and then I said I think I was saying that about Andrew about like protections for like teens that are getting like naked photo shared and they should be liable I don't think I ever meant it for for like the free flow of like news or information or or things like way topar well prevents from being for anything that's posted on on I know but but it seems like you'd have to do it in in in a way where certain stuff you are liable for but but but airing news that may or may not you know you you can't know when you're airing something laptop for example CH uh the V the lab origin of a virus you can't know well you would just be you would be subject it doesn't mean you can't you don't want people that you can have people come after you to say did you have malicious intent with but the bullying part in in in all the all the horrible stuff that happens on on social media the kids they have to take responsibility that but those are separate issues aren't they free spee versus actual U nefarious intent to harm people one of one of the most interesting things about the section 230 debate that that people have often you know neglected is that it actually allows you to take action against harmful material online um effectively and and one of the reasons that that I always thought it shouldn't be changed is is that is is precisely because of that you have effectively a safe harbor for some things that you're doing to address those problematic pieces of content for addressing clearly illegal content like child sexual abuse material and some of the revenge porn things that have gone on online and you can still go after that prosecute the company can still take action about it and it and it actually is sort of encouraged to do so by the protections of section 230 so that's been a kind of Mi a misnomer over time I feel like it would be stronger Chris you're yelling us we got to go but I feel like it would be much stronger if 230 didn't exist there would it would be much more pressure on companies to make sure that they were going after them not just encouraged to do it but you're in trouble if you don't uh I I I mean I think you're still in trouble if you don't there's certainly a lot of regulatory pressure um on addressing it even under a section 230 rine Chris uh come on back there's so much more to talk about with this we really appreciate it it's great to see you absolutely thanks so much for having next on squawk pod Greenland Panama Canada president-elect Trump has floated us expansion an axio senior politic reporter Mark Caputo says as wild as it seems we should take Donald Trump seriously at least sometimes unlike an administrations and campaigns past Donald Trump has a staff and structure around him that says well if Donald Trump says it then we'll try to make it happen welcome back to squawk pod from CNBC where were digesting yesterday's hourong news conference with president-elect Trump the Panama Canal is a disgrace what took place at the Panama Canal they laugh at us because they think we're stupid but we're not stupid anymore we need Greenland for national security purposes I've been told that for a long time long before I even ran I mean people have been talking about it for a long time I'm talking about protecting the Free World you look at you don't even need binoculars you look outside you have China ships all over the place you have Russian ships all over the place we're not letting that happen here's Andrew Ross sorin President elect Trump renewing his call to gain Us control of Greenland also the Panama Canal maybe even Canada yesterday he declined to rule out using military and economic coercion to achieve those goals join us right now with more on all this Mark Caputo is a senior politics reporter for axios good morning to you uh we were debating a little bit of this earlier in the broadcast Mark and I think we're all trying to figure out how much of this we're supposed to take seriously how much we're supposed to take a sort of trump Doctrine uh a negotiating posture of sorts how do you view it one of the things that was said in what 2016 is not to take Trump or that his voters didn't always take Trump literally they took him figuratively I think by now we had what 12 13 years of this we should realize it's both you have to take them literally you have to take them figuratively you have take him seriously and sometimes you have to take him UNS seriously so the short answer to question is I don't know I don't think any of us knows the likelihood that we're actually going to acquire Greenland in some way shape or form when we've got trillions in debt and a huge budget deficit is pretty slim considering the narrow margins in Congress because after all Congress will probably need to do something about taking over New Territory but nevertheless Trump wants to do this in some way shape or form and unlike an Administration and campaigns passed Donald Trump has a staff and structure around him that says well if Donald Trump says it then we'll try to make it happen well how much is it worth Mark I mean I wonder what the blue book is and you remember you remember I I if it's not that much money I I I disagree that that the budget uh deficit wouldn't allow it it certainly allows us to uh to expend a lot of money on on other things uh like that help for Ukraine help for other places we spent I don't remember what we spent on Alaska but it was it was called a Folly at the time I think it would do you remember what it was it was in the millions I don't even think it was in the billions when it happened and one of the great purchases obviously of all time and Greenland if it could be done if you could you know we talk about coercion make them an offer they can't refuse what does that mean exactly that's a good question well in the case of Seward buying Alaska zarus Russia wanted to sell it in the case of Greenland Denmark right now doesn't million million I'll take two right exactly but in the end it's not just whether we can afford it or not it's whether Congress thinks we can afford it or not there are very narrow margins in Congress it's just difficult to see that doesn't mean that Donald Trump isn't serious about it or you know grading on a Donald Trump curve whether he's seriously using about it but we should take it seriously and once he's began talking about this again remember he discussed this in 2018 and 2019 people have to take him seriously about it his campaign does or better said ad but let's let's sort of walk through the various component parts of what was said so there's the Greenland piece which it sounds like if he could purchase it he would the question is if he couldn't purchase it or couldn't afford to or something like that would he use military force to somehow get it that's one piece then there's the Panama Canal and then there's Canada as the 51st state in the United States what do you think is even realistic there and let's just even talk about the political implications of all this which is to say the way Canada for example or even the folks in Panama right now are reacting to all of this they're about to I live in Miami my county commissioner Kevin Cabrera is about to be the Panama the Ambassador for the United States to Panama and so he's going to have his hands full I do think that out of the three scenario as you laid out here Trump is most concerned about Panama not only because of China's presence as a global power trade superpower but also because of the Darian gap which is the only land bridge connecting South America with Central and North America therefore and that has been a major migrant throughway and so Donald Trump who is keenly concerned about trade about China and about immigration is looking at Panama and is very concerned about it so I think out of the three that we've discussed here that is the most likely for him to devote more time policy and resources toward what what about the Canada piece though because they are our neighbor they have been uh an ally a great Ally and there are now concerns you read the the papers in Canada turn on the TVs there I was reading or seeing some video that was coming across on social media and they're you know it sounds like they're apoplectic about what's happening I imagine they are I mean Canada for its entire history has lived in fear of its barbaric brother to the South the United States invading it and taking it over it opted not to become part of the United States even though uh a number of our early founding fathers and our early presents wanted it to the conservative leader of Panama and I must said or better said of Canada whose last name is French and I therefore can't pronounce it because I too am one of these barbarians he's even discounted this so this one is a little harder to see out of all of them the Greenland piece is hard for me to see the Panama piece is less hard to see out of all real quick just finally and you were talking about the people around him uh wanting to help him accomplish these things there was a sense in 2016 that there were people around him who didn't want to help him accomplish uh things that he talked about and so that they were almost blocking or preventing certain things are slow walking things how different is that today and how should we think about that I wrote In axios on Monday that his incoming chief of staff was his campaign co-manager Susie WS who's been with him stuck with him to thick and thin she has the understanding of letting Trump be Trump and trying to execute on his vision and hiring people who are loyal to him loyal to his mission and believe in getting things done for him and not undermining him that's why for instance we haven't seen what we would have seen in the past which would have been Anonymous staff leaks saying oh my God this guy is crazy there's no way we're going to do that not hearing that anymore so that's one of the reasons that we have to take the Greenland the Canada and Panama pieces more seriously is because his staff does Mark want to thank you for joining us this morning we will see what happens and in the meantime I'm sure we'll talk a lot about we will thanks thanks that is squawk pod for today this Wednesday thank you for listening squawkbox is hosted by Joe kernin Becky

Marching steadily higher and hit 7.71% according to mortgage  news daily, which is the highest since early june.  one month ago, it was below 6% and home sales were starting to  pick up, but higher rates are  taking a toll on mortgage  demand.  applications to refinance last week were down 6% year-over-year and applications for mortgage  to buy a home were down 10%  according to the bankers association. The realtors had been saying that homebuyers are getting  used to a new normal of higher rates, but that is not showing up to start the new year, at lost least not in mortgage demand.  much of that is because homes  are just sitting on the market much longer. High prices combined with  higher rates are sidelining  would-be buyers. The forecast for this year is  that mortgage rates will fall  modestly, but stay above 6%  with volatility.

Rick?  >> first of all, the yield at  this auction was 4.913.  it was trading 4.92%. Lower  yield and auction the entire price governments to seller, which is a good thing. That yield i told you is the highest yield at a 30 year bond  auction since august 2007. Should yields close anywhere towards the upper end of this  range on a 30 year bond to 493 and 495 area, that will be the highest going back to october  of 2023. If we go to the metrics, it  gets an a on every level.  solid bid to cover and indirect  and extremely solid, dealers take much less then auction  average. They take less than 13% and 10 auction average 15% and this completes the three lanes of 119 billion and coupon supply, so as you look at the charts and see those yields falling,  that makes sense.  we're over the hump of supply  and the concession seems to be how much higher they moved in  the last several days. Don't forget that tomorrow is a  holiday. Early closing the government cash market and it doesn't surprise me to see this run of buying pushing yields down a bit, but keep in mind that we  test yields that we haven't  se",

                  "Communication, though she also said the recent hack of the  treasury doesn't help the  u.s./china relationship. Joining us now with reaction is  ian bremer, he released his new  list of the top political risks  to watch in 2025 the progress that janet yellen has made with her counterparts in china, what happens to that under trump 2.0. >> first, i think she is right to take some credit, you know, the relationship between the u.s. And china got worse before  it got better under the biden  administration, that initial summit they had in anchorage it  was a disaster, china lecturing  them in return and walking out but last year has really been  much more stable, they've worked on the relationship, they've opened 25 high-level bilateral channels including with  treasury, with commerce, defense, very important, and they've done it to stable ides the relationship without the americans giving away the store, tariffs haven't been removed export controls. U.s. Isn't giving up on taiwan you talk to democrats and  republicans on the hill they don't have a lot to criticize  biden about on china and they're not usually shy, right, so i do  think she's right to lean into that, but it's very unlikely in  my view that that relationship,  that state of affairs between  the u.s. And china will persist  with the incoming trump  administration in part because of the orientation of his top  advisers in cabinet and in part  because trump's focus on tariffs which i certainly think he's going to come out swinging in  the early weeks. >> how do you think china reacts to that because on one hand it's very confrontational on the  other hand he invited xi to his  inauguration.  >> trump always talks about how  brilliant xi is as a strong  leader, how much respect he has  for him, not like trump has a  problem meeting with people he doesn't agree with, think about  kim jong-un last time around and trump loves the idea of cutting  deals, but this is a different environment, i think you'll have a really hard time, even though  they'll have pleasant  conversations with what xi is  willing to offer, i'll buy some  soybeans, i'll buy some boeings  if any are being produced, but that's not going to be enough to get the trump administration to  back away from what's a much more hawkish orientation, not  just on china bilaterally but  also in cutting off the chinese  at the knees and the third countries they're shipping goods through to the united states like mexico facing a lot of  pressure on china from the incoming trump administration, india, vietnam, this is  something that the trump economic team is very, very  focused on and it's going to hurt the chinese >> isn't that the whole point  around the tariffs to get around that label washing.  >> that's right. The chinese government felt like they had a pretty good strategy  in doing that and the trump  administration intends to stop it there's an orientation to cut a  deal if the chinese were really  willing to, you know, sort of  take a knee and cry uncle for  the trump administration but i don't think that's going to  happen it's in the mexico or canada and again the symbolic level they're willing to pay off trump to make him go away, but the demands being made by the trump ed administration are must more substantive and structural than  that i'd pay more attention to the  fact that the chinese are doing  a lot with trying to improve their relationship with india. Japan ending the export controls they've had on the seafood they  said was tainted from fukushima. Why are they suddenly doing that all over the world because they're preparing for a  much more challenging  relationship with the united states, and they also note that  there are a lot of countries around t",

                  "A crucial time for america's  fiscal future. Joining me here exclusively at  the treasury department is the  treasury secretary, janet  yellen. Thank you so much for having us  here.  >> pleasure. Thanks for the invitation.  >> we were just reminiscing,  here earlier 2021 in the depth  of covid, a lot has changed.  >> a lot has changed.  >> the economy has been  resilient. Interest rates were rising,  inflation was raging and yet,  amazingly the economy has  maintained this 2%, 3% growth,  the question is, why was it a  losing issue for the democrats  in the election? >> well, we have seen really  solid growth and we did  experience a surge in inflation  and most people never lived  through an episode like that,  the level of prices about 20%  higher than pre-pandemic, and of course the rate of inflation has come way down, it's now pretty  close, quite close to the fed's  target. So prices are continuing to rise at anything like that and now  very close to normal. But, people i think have  remember these big price  increases and, you know, they  feel it had a very adverse  effect on their cost of living. Now at this point, wages have  gone up a lot, and if you  compare the typical household  now to pre-pandemic, they can  buy the same basket of goods  they could have had in 2019 with we estimate about $1600 leftover to spare, so in real terms wages have outpaced inflation and now  over the last year or more, on  the consistent basis, wage  increases are outstripping  inflation, but there was a  period in which price increases  were very high. >> i it still feels like because we remember the prices before  covid. Prices at the grocery store are  so much higher. When you look back at it do you  have any regrets about the  fiscal stimulus and extra  spending put in place, adding  fuel to the fire when it comes  to kind of sparking that high  inflation.  >> so, i think it's important to remember what the world looked  like when we entered the  beginning of the biden  administration, weed a a  pandemic that was raging out of  control and thousands of people  were dying on a monthly basis  and the unemployment remained  extremely high and people, many  people who had lost their jobs  although they were being  supported by unemployment  insurance were in a position  they could lose the roof over  their heads and we saw people in cars lining up at food banks to  make sure that they could feed  their families and it was really important to spend the money to  alleviate that suffering to make sure that small businesses  didn't go out of business  because of the pandemic. People would have lost their livelihoods, their businesses  that they had invested in, and we wanted to alleviate all of  that suffering we had seen in past downturns  like the great -- during the great recession that people who  were unemployed for a very long  time become scar, alienated from the workforce, they can never  get their lives back on track, i call that scarring and we wanted to avoid that. I think the spending was necessary. >> did it spark the inflation? >> it may have contributed a little bit to the inflation. But by and large, the inflation  was supplyside phenomena the pandemic had led to  shortages of goods coming from china and other parts of the world, it shut down firms like our auto firms without enough  semiconductors to be able to build cars, so there was simply  huge supply chain problems and goods, critical goods that people wanted were in absolute shortage and i think an  important factor in the  inflation ",

Defense is around a trillion dollar spending. Nondefense iscretionary is close to $900 billion. So, that's $2 trillion right there and maybe feel that  defense spending should go up. Mandatory spending which includes social security,  medicare and medicaid, you know  these programs are important to  americans, both democrats and  republicans, have indicated  support for these programs and they're very popular among americans. And so, it's hard to see where there could be substantial cuts  there. And that takes one to taxes  and -- >> they want to keep them lower. >> wel",

                "GAINS. PREDICTING SOME WILD SWINGS AND  SENTIMENT. JOINING US IS ERIC JOHNSTON FROM CANTOR FITZGERALD. >> CHINA IS UNDERGOING A MASSIVE STIMULUS PACKAGE THAT'S LIKELY  GOING TO GROW OVER THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR, THERE'S AN OVERHANG  RIGHT NOW AROUND TARIFFS AND OUR VIEW IS THAT IT'S IN BOTH  PARTIES' INTEREST TO GET SOME  SORT OF A DEAL AND PROBABLY TO  GET IT RELATIVELY EARLY SO WE  THINK THAT OVERHANG CAN BE  ALLEVIATED BY A DEAL FAIRLY  EARLY IN 2025, AT THE SAME TIME  POSITIONING IS EXTREMELY LOW. IN CHINA. PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN UP ON IT. VALUATIONS ARE SUPERATTRACTIVE  AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS, YOU HAVE A GOVERNMENT WHERE, YOU KNOW,  FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION FOR  THIS STIMULUS PACKAGE, THEY'LL  DO WITH WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET BOTH THE ECONOMY TO STABILIZE  AND TO START GROWING AGAIN AND  ALSO TO GET STOCK PRICES HIGHER  AND I THINK YOU WANT TO BE ON  THE SAME SIDE WITH WHAT THAT  TYPE OF GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING TO DO.  >> THAT'S INTERESTING. IT'S FELT A BIT EXTREME LOOKING  AT RECORD-LOW BUYING YIELDS OVER THERE. THE FLIGHT OF CAPITAL. BUT YOU DO SEE SOMETHING  HAPPENING THERE. MEANTIME, BACK STATESIDE WE'VE  BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE FED PRICING IN TERMS OF CUTS, GOING  AWAY FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE  YEAR, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE  EXPECTING ANY IN FIRST HALF  EITHER.  >> WE'RE NOT. THE MARKET IS PRICING IN ONE CUT IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR,  WE THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON  PAUSE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT SIX  MONTHS, WE WERE NOT NECESSARILY  IN AGREEMENT WITH CUTTINGS THEY  DID ALREADY. I THINK WHAT THEY'RE SEEING,  STILL CPI AND PCS WELL ABOVE 2%. PRICES PAID NUMBER YESTERDAY HIT 64. AND WE HAVE A VERY PRO-GROWTH  ADMINISTRATION COMING IN. THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS FOR  THEM TO TAKE A PAUSE, WAIT AND  SEE, SEE WHAT POLICIES ARE  IMPLEMENTED AND ALSO SEE WHAT  HAPPENS WITH INFLATION. IF INFLATION DOES START TO  RE-ACCELERATE TO THE UPSIDE, I  THINK THE MARKET'S GOING TO HAVE A BIG ISSUE WITH THAT AND I  THINK THERE ARE REASONS TO  BELIEVE THAT'S CERTAINLY A  POSSIBILITY. I THINK THE FED ISN'T GOING TO  WANT TO TAKE A RISK OF CUTTING  EVEN FURTHER UNTIL WE HAVE  EVIDENCE THAT'S NOT THE CASE.  >> ERIC, I'M TRYING TO FIGURE  OUT WHAT YOUR POSTURE IS TOWARD  EQUITIES AT THE MOMENT. MOST OF LAST YEAR I BELIEVE YOU  WERE PRETTY NEGATIVE AND PRETTY  BEARISH ON STOCKS AND THE  OVERALL ECONOMY, HAVE YOU  CHANGED YOUR TUNE? >> SO, IN TERMS OF THE MARKET,  WE HAD A MUCH MORE  TRADING-ORIENTED VIEW, YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR. IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMY, WE  THINK WE'RE IN A LATE CYCLE  ECONOMY, WE STL BELIEVE THAT,  WE ALSO THINK THE NEXT THREE YOU KNOW TO SIX MONTHS WITH THE NEW  ADMINISTRATION COMING IN,  CONFIDENCE SURGING AMONG CEOs. THE WEALTH EFFECT IS PROVIDING A BIG TAIL WIND THERE. BETWEEN HOUSING AND STOCK PRICES THE WEALTH CREATION OVER THE  PAST YOU KNOW CALL IT SIX TO  NINE MONTHS HAS BEEN SO GREAT  THAT WE THINK THAT'S ALSO GOING  TO CARRY FORWARD AND YOU'RE  SEEING THAT IN THE ECONOMIC DATA AND WE THINK THAT CONTINUES AT  LEAST FOR THE NEXT THREE TO SIX  MONTHS AND WE'LL SEE WHERE RATES ARE AN",

                  ">>> welcome back to \"squawk on  the street.\"  j.p.  morgan is the latest company  reportedly bringing workers  back to the office five days a  week.  of course, that push to get  workers back to the office in  2025 could be a tailwind for  commercial real estate,  especially right here in new  york city.  scott rechler has got a lot  more on the state of commercial  real estate market in this new  year.  happy new year.  you know i've talked to you in  years past, whether it was 2024  or 2023, you certainly didn't  sound very positive waiting for  the storm to clear so to speak.  the banks to decline in the  value of some of those loans.  >> i think what has happened is  the federal reserve by using  their rhetoric was able to get  the markets loose.  the stop markets up.  the bond markets were open and  the regulators sort of gave  some room.  so this storm sort of hovered  around the coast, but never  actually came onto the coast.  during that period of time, you  saw the big banks, they were  taking reserves.  people were capitulating on  values.  people were estimating where  interest rates were.  so i think '24 is the floor  right now.  '24, we're at this floor where  we're now going to be in  position to start dealing with  these things, but it's not  going to be as distressed as it  was, because the capital has  acknowledged the valuations.  we'll see transaction activity  take place.  >> we will.  but we're sort of at the end of  that, so to speak.  >> i think people who waited in  '24 hoping that interest rates  were going to go low and save  them are going to have a hard  time surviving '25.  for those who say let's go  negotiate with lenders, be  opportunistic, you can thrive  in '25.  we still have a challenge of  all these loans.  $2.3trillion of loans that have  to be refinanced, the bulk of  that over the next three years  at rates that are going to be  much higher than where they  were originally set.  >> you started a distress fund,  i think it was last year.  have you done anything from it?  >> so we've, this year invested  in 9.5 million square feet of  classic office space.  we started by institutional  owners, who just didn't want to  be anything near office was  toxic.  we were buying it at discounted  prices and going to the banks  and renegotiating.  buy great buildings, fix the  capital structures and in  places like new york, you get  them leased.  we work with organizations that  say i see the demand out there,  i don't want to abandon it.  this week, we're going to buy  49% interest in a class a  trophy building with an  institution that says i want to  stay in 51%, but i want to  hedge my bet.  bring in somebody bringing in  good capital, to spend good  money, not bad.  >> have cities been smart about  conversions to the degree that  it's soaking up some of that  eninventory?  >> new invintory?  >> they did put in policies,  the state did and the city of  yes housing program, so you've  seen a dramatic increase of  buildings that actually qualify  for conversion",

KEITH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER  JOINS US NOW.  KEITH, I KNOW YOU'VE LIKED TECH  FOR A WHILE AND REMAIN BULLISH,  BUT TEN YEAR YIELD AT 4.7, DOES  IT CHANGE THINGS?  >> IT DOES SENSE AN INTERNAL  CORRECTION PERIOD THAT'S REALLY  STARTED BACK ON DECEMBER 6th  THAT COINCIDED WITH A LOWER  YIELD.  IT REALLY HASN'T MOVED THAT  MUCH.  REALLY, THE UNCERTAINTY FACTOR  --  >> KEITH, KEITH --  >> YES?  >> KEITH, I'M SORRY, I'VE GOT  TO CUT YOU OFF, BECAUSE YOUR  AUDIO IS ECHOING.  SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FIX  THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU, SO WE  CAN HEAR YOU.  BUT CLEARLY, YOU KNOW, CARL AND  DAVID, THE TEN YEAR MOVE, IT'S  CAUGHT SOME PEOPLE BY SURPRISE.  STOCKS NEVER QUITE LIKE IT WHEN  YOU SEE THIS SHARP FAST MOVE  HIGHER IN THE TEN YEAR AND THE  30 YEAR MOVE.  ESPECIALLY WHEN IT RAISES  QUESTIONS ABOUT SUPPLY AND WHO  IS GOING TO BE BUYERS OF  TREASURY, AND LONG TERM  DEFICITS AND WHAT'S GOING TO  HAPPEN WITH THE NEW  ADMINISTRATION.  THAT FEELS LIKE IT'S LAGGING.  WHEN YOU LOOK AT TECHNOLOGY,  WHICH IS BASED ON FUTURE  VALUATIONS FOR PROFITABILITY,  THERE ARE QUESTIONS.  CARL, YOU MENTIONED THE HALO  AFFECT FROM NVIDIA AT CES, IT'S  COINCIDING WITH MOVING RATES.  >> BOND VOLATILITY, HIGHEST  SINCE NOVEMBER 19th.  I WOULD NOTE A COUPLE COMMENTS  ABOUT VALUATION, THIS WEEK  ALONG FROM HOWARD MARKS AND  GOVERNOR COOK ON MONDAY, SAYING  IN SOME AREAS OF THE MARKET WE  MIGHT BE PRICED FOR PERFECTION  AND VULNERABLE TO A SHARP  DECLINE.  >> YEAH, I THINK THAT CONCERN  CERTAINLY GETS RAISED AT THIS  POINT.  SARAH, YOU RAISED IT AS WELL,  JUST INTEREST COSTS ALSO, WITH  THE EXPECTATION RATES WOULD BE  COMING DOWN.  NO SUCH LUCK AT THIS POINT.  OBVIOUSLY AN OVERALL FOCUS ON  THE BUDGET IS THE DEBTS WE'RE  PAYING ON ROUGHLY $37 TRILLION.  >> I KNOW, IT'S CRAZY.  EVER SINCE THE FEDS START THE  CUTTING RATES THEY'VE GONE ON A  ONE WAY TRAIN HIGHER.  KEITH, YOU'VE FIXED YOUR AUDIO.  ON TECH, WE'RE JUST WONDERING  IF THE 10 YEAR MOVING UP TO  4.7, THE 30 YEAR MOVING TO 5%,  IF THAT CHANGES THINGS AS FAR  AS HOW YOU LOOK AT VALUATIONS  AROUND TECH IN PARTICULAR.  >> SURE, SARAH.  HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HEAR ME NOW.  >>  YES.  >> I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL, OUR  VIEW IS STILL POSITIVE.  I THINK IN THE SHORT TERM BASIS  THE MARKET IS GOING THROUGH A  CORRECTION THAT BEGAN IN LATE  DECEMBER.  IF YOU LOOK AT THE S & P 500 AS  A WHOLE, THE MARKET PEAKED BACK  ON DECEMBER 6th.  THAT'S WHEN YIELDS HAD BOTTOMS.  I DO THINK THIS IS A YEAR TERM  HEADWIND FOR THE OVERALL  MARKET.  YOU ALSO HAD BACK IN DECEMBER,  REALLY HIGH INVESTOR  EXPECTATIONS.  AROUND YOU, WE'RE HAVING A  RESET OF SENTIMENT.  WE STILL THINK THE PRIMARY IS  HIGHER.  YOU LOOK AT TECH, THE MOMENTUM  IS STILL STRONGER THAN THE  OVERALL MARKET.

OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF CONCERN  THERE AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT  ESPECIALLY GIVEN A RELATIVELY  DENSE HOUSING PATTERN THERE.  WHAT IS THE THREAT AT THIS  POINT, OR ARE THE WINDS SORT OF  GOING THE OTHER WAY?  >> Reporter: I MEAN, THE WINDS  ARE GENERALLY MOVING AWAY FROM  SANTA MONICA, BUT THE  EVACUATION DOES EXTEND TO SAN  VICENTE BOULEVARD.

                  ">>> welcome back to \"squawk  box.\"  meta platforms announcing it's  going to end third party fact  checking, and moving to user  generated systems, similar to  the notes community program on  x. Some meta employees took to  the in house employees and  expressed their criticism.  one worker said it appeared  meta was sending a message that  facts no longer matter and  conflating that with a victory  for free speech.  joining us right now, chris  kelly, facebook's former chief  privacy officer.  he's the founder of kelly  investments.  let's just start with the  basics.  what did you think when you  first heard this announcement?  >> in many ways, it's a return  to a free speech tradition that  we in many ways tried to  respect, even as we did more  content moderation in the early  days of facebook.  cleaning up the ability to  communicate and being able to  easily present one's views was  a critical part of the network  from the beginning.  and in some ways mark feels  we've gotten away from that.  >> where do you stand on this  issue?  i think there's a question, has  mark's mind evolved, or was  this always where mark's head  sort of us, and maybe some of  the people around him and i'm  thinking of the others that  pushed him in another  direction.  what's this sort of genuine  view of this?  >> i think you have to create a  space?  that allows people to  communicate effectively.  that requires some ability to  push back.  in the american free speech  tradition that is usually with  more free speech, and not in  taking, you know, too much  down.  we always, we never wanted to  be the arbiters of truth.  that's always a hard position  to be in.  you know, but you have to make  sure that, you know, your  community doesn't decline into  a sesspool of accusations back  and forth all the time, and of  the presentation of  misinformation either.  the a.i.  tools that facebook has  deployed, and meta has deployed  over time on all of its  networks still operate here and  there will be addressing of  child sexual abuse material, of  illegal content, things like  that.  >> chris, a huge part of the  decisions in the past, i would  say were business decisions.  business decisions based on at  least a view, maybe wrongly,  but a view that advertisers  wanted this kind of control  over the platform.  or at least people were telling  mark zuckerberg that.  the question now is whether  advertisers will stick with the  platform.  very interestingly, i would  argue to you that x now is  obviously a much broader  platform today to the extent  that it's more free speech  oriented, but it hasn't  necessarily worked as an  advertising platform.  >> i do think the advertisers  are going to continue to  express their opinions, and  they're not going to want to  have their brand advertising in  particular appear next to  offensive material.  i think that will continue to  be a piece of pressure on the  company just as it is on x and  every other platform.  so i don't think that this will  actually end up making a  massive difference in your day- to-day experience on facebook.  >> so you don't think it  changes.  do you think the experience on  x has changed?  >> i do think it has.  and we'll see if that works for  advertisers vertime.  i think there's some  encouraging indications that,  you know, there's some  adaptation that's going on.  the community feature is  excellent, and it's been  implemented very well.  >> there's an interesting  moment yesterday during the  press conference.  on one side, you saw mark  zuckerberg taking to facebook  and instagram, announcing all  of this.  making, i hope a genuine  argument, but then of course,  and saying that he was doing it  in part because politically the  country has moved.  and then three hours later, you  have trump being asked whether  he's ffectively doing this  genuinely or whether he's doing  this because of the threats  that have come from trump, and  he says yeah, probably.  it's probably because he's  doing it under duress.  >> i did see that.  but i do think, having been  there in the initial  discussions, we always wanted  to adhere to the american free  speech tradition, which is more  speech is the answer to  difficult speech.  it was meant -- facebook was  meant ",

Inflation expectations are  stable.  we don't have an inflation  problem.  we have an inflation issue  relative to a 2% target.  you heard previously, this  notion of sticking inflation,  that's actually stable  inflation.  that doesn't disrupt the  underlying economy in any  fundamental way.  >> are you arguing for them to  cut rates even as inflation is  hotter than they'd been hoping  for?  >> my worry is the opposite.  if they really believe in 2%  inflation, they would hike  rates.  >> so this is an argument  against them hiking rates.  >> correct.  so if they really believed it,  what i think we're going to  hear is yes, we are aiming for  2% inflation, but down the  road, and we're going to  tolerate, we may get one cut  this year, but we should not  want them to be dead set on 2%.  because if they're dead set on  2% the rates are going un.  >> do you up.  >> what would happen in the  markets if either there are no  cuts or they raised cuts?  >> i think we can live with no  cuts.  i think we've adjusted  dramatically.  from a year ago, we were  expecting 6 to 8 cut.  now we're expecting 1 to 2. The  market has all the way back to  july.  this economy remains robust.  >> we got the headlines from  waller's speech today about  what he's going to be talking  about.  i have to say, i was a little  surprised it was more doveish  than i had anticipated.  because they've worked so hard  to try and get to the point  where the market is not  expecting them to cut rates at  every meeting.  this sounded more doveish.  and raised more questions about  this.  i don't know what you thought  about his comments.  >> i was as surprised as you  were.  i do know, if i'm sitting in  the fed right now, i have to  navigate two landscapes.  monetary policy and politics.  >> there's a lot of people that  are nodding with you, because  we can deflate our way out of  some of the step, but the  difference between 2% and 3%  compounded pour the dollar is  devastating.  for you to just blow it off is  a little weird.  there's a reason they want 2%.  anyone can move goal posts.  that's 5% higher than 2%.  >> do you know where 2% comes  from?  >> 3%, it would make all of us  feel awful in ten years.  >> 2% comes from the bank of  new zealand in the '90.  it's an arbitrary number.  >> 5 is an arbitrary number, if  you want to deflate 36  trillion, let's go to 10 hen.  >> i don't want to pull the rug  from under u.s. Economic  exceptionalism.  >> you're starting to at 3%.  >> i think we are investing in  the economies of tomorrow in  the growth drivers of tomorrow.  >> the government?  >> no, the private sector,  everything else.  if you push this economy --  >> the private sector is not  what causes inflation.  >> joe, if you push this  economy into recession, you  would not just lose current  standard of living, you lose  future standard of living.  2.5 to 3 is what i said.  you immediately went to 3. As  long as inflation expectations  are stable, you can navigate.  >> better buy some bitcoin,  mohamed.  >> he did.  >> not enough.  >> none of us did.  damn.  >> what do you think of the  michael barr situation?  >> so i think that is a -- that  is someone taking one for the  fed.  i think he stepped down to  protect the fed to again help  na",

                  ">>> THE TIK TOK BAN IS SAID TO  TAKE EFFECT ON JANUARY 19  UNLESS THE SUPREME COURT TAKES  ACTION.  JOINING US FOR THE LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS GOING ON UNTIL THE  DEADLINE IS THE SEO CONSULTING  FIRM KRISTOF AND COMPANY.  SHE HAS WORKED ON THE HILL FOR  JOHN McCAIN AND IN SILICON  VALLEY FOR GOOGLE, UBER, AND  SALESFORCE.  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.  WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN THE  NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS IN YOUR  VIEW?  >> WHAT WILL HAPPEN, IN MY VIEW  IS THE SUPREME COURT'S WILL  UPHOLD THE BAN.  IT IS A WELL-WRITTEN LAW.  THE FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENTS  ARE TOTALLY FAILED.  THEY HAVE NO REAL REASON NOT TO  OF BEEN.  PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS WEIGHED IN  WITH AMICUS BRIEF ASKING THEM  TO DELAY.  I THINK IT GOES FORWARD ON  JANUARY 19.  >> WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN AT THAT  POINT?  >> WE DON'T KNOW IF EXACTLY  WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE FOR  USERS.  IT MEANS THAT THE APP STORES  CAN NO LONGER LET PEOPLE  DOWNLOAD IT.  APPLE AND GOOGLE.  YOU WILL SELECT TIK TOK ON YOUR  PHONE, WHETHER OR NOT IT WILL  WORK IS TO BE SEEN.  IT IS UP TO TIK TOK WITH WHAT  THEY DO WITH USER DATA.  YOU WILL HAVE A WORSE AND WORSE  PRODUCT EXPERIENCE.  YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UPGRADE  IT.  IT COULD JUST GO DARK, WE DON'T  KNOW.  >> THIS HAPPENS, YOU GO ONE  MONTH AFTER THAT, AND IT IS  OKAY AGAIN, CAN HUMPTY DUMPTY  GO BACK TOGETHER AGAIN?  >> IT COULD BE PAUSED BY THE  PRESIDENT AFTER HE IS  INAUGURATED.  THERE IS A PROVISION FOR A 90  DAY PAUSE.  IF HE SAYS, LISTEN, THEY'RE  LOOKING TO THE SOFT, HE COULD  PUT A PAUSE ON IT.  THIS REPORT IS THE HIGHEST  COURT OF THE LAND.  TO UNDO THIS, THEY WOULD NEED A  NEW LAW FROM CONGRESS.  >> I THINK YOU WOULD DO THAT,  RIGHT?  HE IS READY TO ANNEX CANADA,  THIS DOES NOT SEEM LIKE MUCH OF  A STRETCH.  >> MAKE A POINT, HE HAS BEEN  BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS LIKE THE  GULF OF MEXICO.  ALSO, IMMIGRATION, TARIFFS, AND  NOW THEY TALK ABOUT PARDONS  THIS CANNOT BE THE TOP OF THE  PRIORITY LIST.  HE COULD HIT PAUSE AS IF HE  COULD GET A LEGISLATIVE  SOLUTION OR NEGOTIATE  SOMETHING.  YOU WANT TO TALK DIRECTLY WITH  THE CHAIRMAN TO DO THAT.  HE IS INDICATING THAT HE WANTS  TO DO THAT.  HE HAS 14 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON  TIK TOK.  >> HE DOESN'T LIKE IT BECAUSE  IT HELPED.  BARON TRUMP TOLD HIM, YOU HAVE  TO DO TIK TOK.  >> HE HAS ALL OF THAT BITCOIN  FTX MONEY.  >> HE'S GOT ALL THAT BITCOIN  MONEY.  FTFC.  I FORGOT ALREADY.  >> FTX.  >> YEAH, THAT'S WHAT.  TOO MANY LETTERS.  IS IT -- ARE THEY STEALING  EVERYTHING THAT THERE IS TO  KNOW ABOUT OUR YOUTH IN THIS  COUNTRY, AND USING IT TO  SUBVERT THE FUTURE OF THE  UNITED STATES OR NOT?  THAT'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.  THAT WAS THE WHOLE IDEA.  IT HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING.  AND IF SO, THEN IT DOESN'T  MATTER WHETHER IT HELPED WIN AN  ELECTION.  IT'S AN INSIDIOUS THING THAT  PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE AROUND.  WHICH IS IT?  >> WELL ONE THING THAT WE DON'T  KNOW IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN  THOSE NATIONAL SECURITY  BRIEFINGS.  SO WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED, A  NUMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT  AGENTS WERE SKEPTICAL.  THEY SAID I'M SUPPORTING THIS  LAW.  PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SEEN THOSE  BRIEFINGS.  WE HAVE NOT SEEN THEM.  IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT THE  CCP HAS SHOWN THEY ARE  INTERESTED IN, AND ACTIVE IN  MANIPULATING PUBLIC DISCORD IN  THE UNITED STATES.  NOW THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SEEMS  TO SHRUG THIS OFF.  170MILLION PEOPLE DON'T MIND  HAVING A SURVEILLANCE DEVICE IN  THEIR POCKET, IT SEEMS, BUT  THEY HAVEN'T SEEN ALL THE  EVIDENCE.  WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT, MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS HAVE, BOTH PRESIDENT  BIDEN AND TRUMP HAVE SEEN THAT  INFORMATION.  >> NICKY IS IT POSSIBLE THAT  ALL THE PHONES ARE SENDING  INFORMATION TO THE DRONES?  >> IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY ARE  VIOLATING TERMS OF SERVICE FROM  THE APP STORES AND COLLECTING  THINGS ON ALL OF OUR PHONES.  ANYONE IN WASHINGTON, WHERE I'M  BASED WHO WORKS IN NATIONAL  SECURITY DOES NOT TOUCH TIKTOK.  THEY BELIEVE THAT IT COULD  SCRAPE INFORMATION.  I THINK MOST TEENAGERS DON'T  CARE.  >> RIGHT.  THEY DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHINA'S GOING  TO GET FROM LOOKING AT WHAT  TEENS TALK ABOUT.  NOT A WHOLE LOT.  IF THEY DO LOOK AT IT, THEY  PROBABLY SAY, WE DON'T HAVE TO  DO ANYTHING.  U.S. IS GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY.  GO AHEAD.  >> ONE LAST THING IS PRESIDENT  TRUMP HAS SAID OVER AND OVER IS  ONE OF HIS BIG CONCERNS IS THIS  IS A BOONE TO INSTAGRAM.  MARK ZUCKERBERG IS THE BIGGEST  BENEFICIARY OF THIS BAN.  THERE'S A REASON WE'RE SEEING  HIM ON BENDED KNEE THIS WEEK.  I THINK THERE'S A REASON F",

                  "Slowing to 4.6%.  that's the slowest pace of  gains since july of 2021.  for those who moved jobs, pay  growth was roughly in line with  last month.  that's at 7.1%.  for more on the adp data, i  want to bring in neil  richardson, ad p's chief  economist, who has been keeping  these numbers secret.  what do you think?  how should we actually think  about this?  the market is doing a little  bit better actually on the back  of this.  but that may be a bad news is  good news situation.  >> it's hard to know when you  incorporate the fed.  from our perspective, what  we've seen all year is very  stable hiring.  we saw a pick up in october.  this december report definitely  represents a down shift from  what we saw earlier in the  quarter.  but it's still a solid number.  pockets of weakness are  something to watch.  manufacturing shed jobs for  three consecutive months.  that's concerning.  this is a sector that could  benefit from a rate cut.  what's doing the heavy lifting  in services is no longer  leisure and hospitality.  we think that game is over.  it's really healthcare.  healthcare is not cyclical.  it's tied to, i think,  demographic hiring.  so you take these two, the good  sector and the service sector.  service is being driven by the  democrat demographics.  manufacture i think very much  focuses on the short term.  >> if you were sitting here in  three months though, from now,  based on these trends, what do  you see happening?  because i think that's what  we're really trying to  understand.  >> you know, first of all, i  think when you really want to  know what's going on in the  labor market, you have to shift  from jobs to wages.  because wages are going to tell  the story of what the fed will  do next.  what we saw was a step down in  wage growth, particularly for  job sayers.  4.6%.  that's a very slow pace of job  growth -- i mean, excuse me,  wage growth.  but not slow enough to be  consistent with a 2% inflation  target.  so that means one of two  things.  either wage growth has to come  down significantly over the  next three months for the fed  to feel comfortable cutting  rates, or we're going to get  into the situation where the  fed has to pause and wait for  the labor market to come along  with this rate cut.  >> did you hear christopher  waller's comments this morning  that he's going to be giving a  speech a little later today?  i was a little surprised that  he still seems to be leaving  the door open to several more  rate cuts this year.  >> given the uncertainty on the  policy front, i think leaving  the door open is a wise move  for the federal reserve.  honestly, they've been leaving  the door open being data  dependent is basically saying  i'm opening the doors and the  windows and seeing if there's a  next data point.  >> although it feels like the  market has been expecting these  rate cuts and they've been  trying to maybe talk themself  out of a position where they  are expected to cut it every  rate meeting.  this seems like it was a swing  back in the other direction.  >> six months ago, i think the  foregone conclusion was that  the fed would move like the fed  has in the past, which is  moderately and consistently,  every single meeting was a rate  cut.  they've channeled that.  that might not be the case.  there may be pauses on the way.  this has been a bumpy  deceleration in wage growth.  i believe it will be a bumpy  deceleration in the interest  rate as well.  >> bumpy, because the data has  been bumpy too.  >> absolutely.  we've seen pockets of strength  and pockets of weakness.  we saw a big surge i",

                  "The answer, royal caribbean  icon of the seas the ship is  1196 feet long and 219 feet  wide.  >>> speaker mike johnson is  looking to pass a  reconciliation package through  congress by april.  join us on the gop game plan  and present electrons agenda is  house republican policy  committee chair, kevin hern.  congressman,  it is good to see  you.  will be one or two at this  point?  what is your best guess?  >> what is the issue today, we  have been given the gift of the  opportunity to be in this place  to pass a reconciliation bill  and do things like extend the  tax cuts, and secure the  southern border, get energy  dominance back where was 4  years ago.  we have not been given as a  gift of time.  we need to get these tax cuts  extended by the end of the year  for every single business will  see a rise in causes money  comes blowing back to  washington, d.c. If you look  back, the fastest way to get  that done in the house is one  bill as trump says, one big  beautiful bill so we get  everybody's interest taken care  of as we move forward.  >> that would include a debt  limit increase, as well as $2.5  trillion in net cuts to  spending.  is that possible?  for we believe so.  we have more spending cuts  aligned up than that.  that seems to be the middle of  the road or on the low end.  it ranges from 2 trillion to 5  trillion.  we are looking at releasing  lands to be drilled on,  permitting processes that are  really important, and these are  things that are impactful.  a lot of the money that you saw  the biden administration, or  saw them spend on illegal  immigration, was president  trump order policies, that  would slow down or stop.  a lot of spending cuts that we  could pull in to offset the  cost of extending the tax cuts.  as for we go through the same  process where someone decides on what is a budget  reconciliation, i remember the  democrats loved this pv uses a  lot recently.  if someone has to decide what  can go in there, right?  for they do.  the budget reconciliation  process was part of the 1974  budget control act.  it was a failsafe if you cannot  come through the budget and the  authorizations and  appropriations to hit september  30 each year.  they gave another avenue.  it requires very narrow  language.  as being impactful to the  budget.  that is is in a process,  c.d.o.t.  to have the 60 vote rule on the  filibuster.  the commentary in the senate  will control what gets into the  reconciliation framework.  and the house, the ways and  means and tax quality  subcommittee is that on will be  working make sure that the tax  cuts fit into the  reconciliation process, along  with energy and commerce, and  10 other committees.  >> can you guarantee the  parliamentarian will let all of  the border security provisions  in there as well?  >> not all, because we looked  at hr 2 that the house and did  pass back in march 2023,  overwhelmingly, in a very  narrow margin, we had a three  vote margin, now we have about  two.  we are getting accustomed to  working with the 99% approval  ratings to get a bill passed.  there are things in there that  are not impactful to the  budget, they are more policy.  you cannot pass policy in a  budget reconciliation process.  went to strip out those ideas  that were in there with the  bills that it pass to the  senate to make sure we get only  things in there that will have  a budget impact.  for if it was two bills,  something to be in the second  bill?  then you would need 60?  how would you do that?  you can do that?  >> if you have the second  reconciliation bill, it might  be something, things you might  have to look at the did not get  into the first bill. You find a  way to present it to the  parliamentarian where they  might accept it.  that's why so important to get  one bill done early and start  working on that and try to get  it done by memorial day. This  is a lot of work, as is of the  opening, we are not given the  gift of time.  all tax cuts expire on december  31 of this year.  every single american and small  business will see a small tax  increase if we don't get it  done.  it is important.  this should be a bipartisan  process.  the democrats should all people  have tax increases.  we are working hard.  we will see what happens.  for where will the corporate  scope?  is there some of for that?  to go to next year? is it  possible to do that?  >> is it possible to go from 21  to 15 on the corporate tax rate  just for domestic producers?  is that would be in there?  >> we want to look at it, that  is an additional campaign  conversation that the president  had, just like no tax on tips  and no tax on social security.  those are things we had to  figure out if they can fit n.  we will do that as we get the  legislation moving forward to  going to the reconciliation  package and see what fits in  there, and how we square.  cbo committee on taxation look  at those.  those are important as we move  forward.  we are working passionately to  do as much as we possibly can  on president trump's campaign  promises.  for in terms of pay for some of  you know if there is any  agreement or areas you think  you can get agreement on pay  force to make up for the  givebacks and taxes?  how do we do that in a balanced  fashion?  >> we saw some of that is in hr  1 last year.  the republican house did pass  that, the number one priority,  which was energy dominance.  that is something that  president trump work on.  we heard president trump across  all the campaign trail city  went to across america, talking  about the way we would fix our  way out of this going forward,  using minerals under our feet,  oil and gas, and other mining  opportunities that we have.  looking at how we can release  those, we are very dependent on  the congo for cobalt and china  for processing that coba",

                  "Latest, the doctor says while  the bidens last-minute $306  million package to find bird  flu is welcome news, there is  much more to be done when  president-elect trump takes  office.  joining is now the fda  commissioner.  he is also a pfizer board  member and a cnbc contributor.  scott, let's talk this through.  we talk you and last week, you  said  you were not that  concerned about bird flu  becoming a huge threat for  humans.  has that changed at all?  is your take changed since we  heard of the first human that  died of bird flu?  >> that has not changed.  this is a low probability risk.  it could be a high impact  event, and the thing we want to  take steps to mitigate.  there are things we can do and  could have been doing, going  boards reduce the risk that  this could spread into humans.  we need to be testing more on  farms to turn over the cases  and isolate cows that become  infected and chicken flocks as  well.  we need to do more to help  farmers protect dairy workers  be providing swabs to dairy  workers so they can diagnose  themselves.  the thing you worry about is  people becoming co-infected  with this virus and seasonal  influenza.  you get the combination of the  viruses, that would enable the  virus to spread more easily.  that's what happened in 2009.  that was the combination  between the swine flu and  seasonal influenza.  to happen in a pig and then it  became a pandemic strain.  want to mitigate the risks.  you want to do more on the  therapeutic side.  we did stockpile tamiflu, but  not the whole range of  antivirals that could be  effective.  if you look in the journal  medicine in the case reports  two weeks ago, one patient  became very sick in louisiana  canada.  the strength became resistant  to tamiflu as virus continue to  progress in those two patients.  you want to have multiple  antivirals. We have not done  that.  there is a lot we could be  doing to mitigate the risk that  we have not done.  or we have done a late in the  process.  >> why do you think that is?  for there was a tug-of-war  between human health  regulators, public health  regulators, cdc, and other  health agencies and  agricultural officials that felt this would burn out on the  farms.  they did not want to take steps  that would be costly and  burdensome to the farmers.  this is very structural. This  happens all the time between  human health and animal health  regulators.  i had challenges getting my  inspectors on produce farms for  example we had outbreaks of e.  coli are response.  they were reluctant to let  federal regulators on the farms  to isolate what fields were  contaminated.  you see the ension play out  all the time.  there really was a presumption  among the animal health  officials that this would burn  its way through the dairy herd  and eventually be extinguished.  that has not happened.  it has become endemic.  we are seeing it in migratory  birds.  the two patient became very  sick, the one in canada and the  one in louisiana have the  strain that was in migratory  birds.  i am speculating here, but it  is likely because they got sick  by inhaling dry feces from the  birds.  so far, the infections on the  dairy farms have been  conjunctivitis.  it is not getting into the  lower airways.  >> do you think that the state  and local officials and the  animal control officials have  changed their mind about the  concern level here?  if they don't, is there  anything that will get done?  >> there are indications that  they have changed their mind  that the state level.  we see states doing aggressive  testing of dairy cattle.  we have also seen the  implementation in the last  month, in december, a full  testing of milk at the federal  level.  animal health officials  recognized they needed to take  aggressive steps on the farms.  the other thing we could be  doing is increasing the  compensation for affected dairy  farms.  the farmers not be bearing the  brunt of doing the right thing.  they are on the front lines.  they should not bear the  economic rent -- bronx of  calling animals and testing for ",

YESTERDAY HE DECLINED TO RULE  OUT USING MILITARY AND ECONOMIC  COERCION TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. JOINING US RIGHT NOW WITH MORE  ON ALL OF THIS MARK CAPUTO, A  SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER FOR  AXIOS. GOOD MORNING TO YOU. WE WERE DEBATING A LITTLE BIT OF THIS EARLIER IN THE BROADCAST,  MARK, AND I THINK WE'RE ALL  TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH OF THIS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE  SERIOUSLY, HOW MUCH WE'RE  SUPPOSED TO TAKE AS SORT OF  TRUMP DOCTRINE, NEGOTIATING  POSTURE OF SORTS. HOW DO YOU VIEW IT? >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS  SAID IN 2016 IS NOT TO TAKE  TRUMP OR THAT HIS VOTERS DIDN'T  ALWAYS TAKE TRUMP LITERALLY,  THEY TOOK HIM FIGURATIVELY. I THINK BY NOW WE HAD 12, 13  YEARS OF THIS WE SHOULD REALIZE  IT'S BOTH. YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIM LITERALLY,  YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIM  FIGURATIVELY, YOU HAVE TO TAKE  HIM SERIOUSLY AND SOMETIMES YOU  HAVE TO TAKE HIM UNSERIOUSLY. SO THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR  QUESTION IS I DON'T KNOW, I  DON'T THINK ANY OF US KNOWS. THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE'RE GOING  TO ACQUIRE GREENLAND WHEN WE  HAVE TRILLIONS IN DEBT AND A  HUGE BUDGET DEFICIT IS PRETTY  SLIM CONSIDERING THE NARROW  MARGINS IN CONGRESS BECAUSE,  AFTER ALL, CONGRESS WILL  PROBABLY NEED TO DO SOMETHING  ABOUT TAKING OVER NEW TERRITORY. BUT NEVERTHELESS, TRUMP WANTS TO DO THIS IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR  FORM AND UNLIKE ADMINISTRATIONS  AND CAMPAIGNS PAST, DONALD TRUMP HAS A STAFF AND STRUCTURE AROUND HIM THAT SAYS, WELL, IF DONALD  TRUMP SAYS IT, THEN WE WILL TRY  TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.  >> HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH? I WONDER WHAT THE BLUE BOOK IS. AND YOU REMEMBER --  >> I HAVE NO IDEA.  >> IF IT'S NOT THAT MUCH MONEY,  I DISAGREE THAT THE BUDGET  DEFICIT WOULDN'T ALLOW IT. IT CERTAINLY ALLOWS US TO SPEND  A LOT OF MONEY ON OTHER THINGS,  LIKE HELP FOR UKRAINE, HELP FOR  OTHER PLACES. >> SURE.  >> WE SPENT -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE SPENT ON ALASKA, BUT IT  WAS -- IT WAS CALLED A FOLLY AT  THE TIME, I THINK -- DO YOU  REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS? IT WAS IN THE MILLIONS. I DON'T EACH ANY IT WAS IN THE  BILLIONS WHEN IT HAPPENED. ONE OF THE GREAT PURCHASES,  OBVIOUSLY, OF ALL TIME. GREENLAND, IF IT COULD BE  DONE -- IF YOU COULD -- YOU  KNOW, WE TALK ABOUT COERCION,  MAKE THEM AN OFFER THEY CAN'T  REFUSE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY? >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WELL, IN THE CASE OF SEWARD,  BUYING SQUA, CZARIST RUSSIA  WANTED TO SELL IT. IN THE CASE OF GREENLAND THEY  DON'T WANT TO.  >> $7 MILLION.  >> I WILL TAKE TWO, RIGHT? >> EXACTLY. >> BUT IN THE IT'S NOT JUST  WHETHER WE CAN AFFORD IT OR NOT, IT'S WHETHER CONGRESS THINKS WE  CAN AFFORD IT OR NOT. THERE ARE NARROW MARGINS IN  CONGRESS. IT'S JUST DIFFICULT TO SEE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT DONALD  TRUMP ISN'T SERIOUS ABOUT IT OR, YOU KNOW, GRADING ON A DONALD  TRUMP CURVE WHETHER HE'S  SERIOUSLY MUSING ABOUT IT, BUT  WE SHOULD TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND  ONCE HE BEGAN TALKING ABOUT THIS AGAIN -- REMEMBER HE DISCUSSED  THIS IN 2018 AND 2019. PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE HIM  SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT. >> MARC, LET'S WALK THROUGH THE  VARIOUS COMPONENT PARTS OF WHAT  WAS SAID. SO THERE IS THE GREENLAND PIECE  WHICH IT SOUNDS LIKE IF HE COULD PURCHASE IT, HE WOULD. THE QUESTION IS IF HE COULDN'T  PURCHASE IT OR COULDN'T AFFORD  TO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WOULD HE USE MILITARY FORCE TO SOMEHOW GET IT? THAT'S ONE PIECE. THEN THERE'S THE PANAMA CANAL  AND THEN THERE'S CANADA AS THE  51st STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS EVEN  REALISTIC THERE? AND LET'S EVEN TALK ABOUT THE  POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF ALL OF THIS, WHICH IS TO SAY THE WAY  CANADA, FOR EXAMPLE, OR EVEN THE FOLKS IN PANAMA RIGHT NOW ARE  REACTING TO ALL OF THIS. >> THEY'RE -- I LIVE IN MIAMI. MY COUNTY COMMISSIONER, KEVIN  CABRERA IS ABOUT TO BE THE  AMBASSADOR FOR THE UNITED STATES TO PANAMA AND SO HE'S GOING TO  HAVE HIS HANDS FULL. I DO THINK THAT OUT OF THE THREE SCENARIOS YOU LAID OUT HERE  TRUMP IS MOST CONCERNED ABOUT  PANAMA. NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF CHINA'S  PRESENCE AS A GLOBAL POWER TRADE SUPER POWER, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE DARION GAP, THE ONLY LAND  BRIDGE CONNECTING SOUTH AMERICA  WITH CENTRAL AND NORTH AMERICA,  THEREFORE. THAT HAS BEEN A MAJOR MIGRANT  THROUGH WAY. SO DONALD TRUMP WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT TRADE, CHINA AND  IMMIGRATION, IS LOOKING AT  PANAMA AND IS VERY CONCERNED  ABOUT IT. I THINK OUT OF THE THREE WE'VE  DISCUSSED HERE THAT IS THE MOST  LIKELY FOR HIM TO DEVOTE MORE  TIME, POLICY AND RESOURCES  TOWARD.  >> WHAT ABOUT THE CANADA PIECE,  THOUGH? BECAUSE THEY ARE OUR NEIGHBOR,  THEY HAVE BEEN AN ALLY, A GREAT  ALLY, AND THERE ARE NOW  CONCERNS -- YOU READ THE PAPERS  IN CANADA, TURN ON THE TVs  THERE, I WAS READING -- OR  SEEING SOME VIDEO THAT WAS  COMING ACROSS ON SOCIAL MEDIA  AND THEY'RE -- YOU KNOW, IT  SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE APOPLECTIC  ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING.  >> I IMAGINE THEY ARE. CANADA FOR ITS ENTIRE HISTORY  HAS LIVED IN FEAR OF ITS  BARBARIC BROTHER TO THE SOUTH,  YOU UNITED STATES, INVADING IT  AND TAKING IT OVER. IT OPTED NOT TO BECOME PART OF  THE UNITED STATES EVEN THOUGH A  NUMBER OF OUR EARLY FOUNDING  FATHERS AND OUR EARLY PRESIDENTS WANTED IT TO. THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER OF  PANAMA -- OR BETTER SAID OF  CANADA WHOSE LAST NAME IS FRENCH SO I THEREFORE CAN'T PRONOUNCE  IT BECAUSE I, TOO, AM ONE OF  THESE BARBARIANS HE HAS EVEN  DISCOUNTED IT. THIS ONE IS HARDER TO SEE OUT OF ALL OF THEM. THE GREENLAND PIECE IS HARD TO  SEE, THE PANAMA IS LESS HARD TO  SEE OUT OF ALL THREE.  >> YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE  PEOPLE AROUND HIM WANTING HIM TO ACCOMPLISH THESE THINGS. THERE WAS A SENSE IN 2016 THERE  WERE PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHO  DIDN'T WANT TO HELP HIM  ACCOMPLISH THINGS THAT HE TALKED ABOUT.  >> CORRECT.  >> THEY WERE ALMOST BLOCKING OR  PREVENTING CERTAIN THINGS OR  SLOW WALKING THINGS. HOW DIFFERENT IS THAT TODAY AND  HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THAT? >> I WROTE IN AXIOS ON MONDAY  THAT HIS INCOMING CHIEF OF STAFF WAS HIS CAMPAIGN CO-MANAGER  SUSIE WILES STUCK WITH HIM  THROUGH THICK AND THIN. SHE HAS THE UNDERSTANDING OF  LETTING TRUMP BE TRUMP AND  TRYING TO EXECUTE ON HIS VISION  AND HIRING PEOPLE WHO ARE LOYAL  TO HIM, LOYAL TO HIS MISSION AND BELIEVE IN GETTING THINGS DONE  FOR HIM AND NOT UNDERMINING HIM. THAT'S WHY, FOR INSTANCE, WE  HAVEN'T SEEN WHAT WE WOULD HAVE  SEEN IN THE PAST, WHICH WOULD  HAVE BEEN ANONYMOUS STAFF LEAKS  SAYING, OH, MY GOD, THIS GUY IS  CRAZY. THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT. NOT HEARING THAT ANYMORE. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT  WE HAVE TO TAKE THE GREENLAND,  THE CANADA AND PANAMA PIECES ",

                  "Wharton school of business.  he's also a cnbc contributor.  thank you for joining us on the  show today.  >> happy to be here.  >> i want to get your initial  reaction to what we heard from  mark zuckerberg.  he mentioned that the steps  they will be taking will be  similar to x. What was your  take on what he had to say?  >> similar kind of take, frank.  i think what we're seeing here  is not super surprising, we're  looking at a tech company who  is basically saying listen, we  have to make sure that we are  not in regulatory harms way  here and so it's been very  clear that the president-elect  has stated very clearly that  listen, you are with us or  you're not.  so there is this retaliatory,  sort of flavor out there that i  think many of the tech  companies responding to.  it's not surprising, because i  think it is pretty normal for  most companies to say, you  know, when a new presidential  administration comes in, we  want to make sure we are  aligned for sure.  what is critical here, frank,  is the idea that this is really  the critical question that  facebook and meta has been  facing for a long time, which  is to say listen, are we a news  platform or are we a vehicle  where information flows  through?  i think we're about to get our  answer on that.  >> all right, so we're spending  a lot of time looking what the  possible motivations are,  whether trying to line itself  with the incoming  administration or be more like  x. I want to ask you, someone  who is a marketing expert, is  there a business reason to do  this?  there's been a public relations  impact.  is there a business reason to  do all this?  >> there absolutely is a  business reason to do this,  frank.  let my lay this out quickly.  i think a couple of things.  it costs a lot of money to  police free speech, free speech  in the social media platforms.  you have to pay monitors, you  have to set up automated  algorithms to check across a  wide area of high scaled users,  millions, billions of users and  things of that nature.  so that's a cost.  that's a real expense that you  can scale back if you're doing  this.  so from that perspective,  economically, that also makes  sense.  i think it also makes sense  from the perspective of the  idea that at least for half the  population, as you know, there  is too much of this free  speech, you know, there isn't  enough of this free speech  advocacy and too much wokism.  those consumers will say, you  know what?  i may be more -- i may look at  the platform now more  favorablely because now i see  it as aligned with my own views  on the ability to say whatever  it is you want to say out  there.  so i think there's two reasons.  there's a consumer reason that  says those advocates of free  speech will be more attracted  to the platform.  those operational costs that  could be reduced, frank, are  significant in terms of what  meta is facing.  >> thinking about 95% of the  revenues from ads.  how do you see it impacting  that part of the business?  not fact checking is cost  cutting, but what about the  revenues coming in?  do you see the fact they are  shifting more towards x and i  want your take on how x is  operating now.  if they are shifting toward x,  what does that mean for future  revenue growth?  >> it's a great question,  frank.  there are two forces here that  are going on.  the first will be, there will  be a group of enterprise  organizations that will say, we  can't be on that platform.  we saw that with x, ibm and  other companies that said hey,  we can't allow our messages to  be coinciding with other things  that might be seen as hate  speech or might be detrimental  to our brand.  there is that, sort of, that  reaction that is going to say,  you know, we'll pull back.  some companies will pull back  and say, we don't want to be on  the platform advertising.  however, there will be  additional counteraffect of  that, which will be companies  that say, we do want to be  there because they may brand  themselves or see themselves,  frank, as kind of this antiwoke  kind of brand.  parallel economy kinds of  brands.  those brands are probably going  to be more attractive.  we'll see some companies  dropping off because of the  effects to their brands and  their ideological points of  view.  but we'll also see some brands  coming on board more so as  advertising opportunities  because of the fact they see  alignment with meta's new  policies in terms of scaling  back these different  approaches.  >> you know, interesting  intersection between commerce  and culture when it comes to  this decision from meta.  i have one last question for  you.  you work down there in  philadelphia.  where ",

                  "Let's bring in megan chu.  megan, good to see you.  >> good morning, frank, thanks  for having me.  >> megan, how do you see today,  this week shaping up?  what's your word of the day?  >> yeah, so i think my word of  the day is quality.  i think that really describes  the environment that we are  dealing with in at least the  first quarter, probably the  first half of this year.  the way i think about it, and  redefine quality is companying  generating really strong,  sustainable earnings while also  carrying low levels of  leverage.  so, the two most likely  scenarios are inflation  continues to come down.  the economy softens a little  bit, and the fed cuts much more  than what we are expecting.  in that environment, where you  get a softer growth outlook,  you really want those companies  that are generating  sustainable, strong earnings.  but if we're wrong and the  market is more right and rates  stay elevated for longer and  the fed is not cutting very  much, if at all next year, then  i think you really need to be  focusing on companies that do  not rely on interest rate  sensitive debt or their  borrowing needs and higher  quality companies tend to carry  much higher levels of overall  cash.  i think it's a win/win.  that's why higher quality is a  theme we're focused on.  >> i want to go back to your  base case.  i think people now are thinking  it's two cuts, maybe just one  cut.  inflation appears to be  stickier than we thought it  was.  on your base case at least,  where do you get confidence  that inflation is going down,  especially after the read  yesterday, we saw companies are  preparing for tariffs and  prices are going up.  >> well, in all honesty, and  full disclosure, yesterday's  data did not work toward our  base case, where we not only  had pryer prices paid in the  services, but we got an uptick  in the jolt survey, and what  we're working on the inflation  front is really the underlying  price pressures.  if you look at categories of  housing and then everything  housing.  housing continues to come down.  it's stickier than we would  like.  if you look at the categories  outside of housing, that has  been at or below the fed's  target for a number of months  now, and we just do not see the  conditions that would really be  necessary, the inflations stay  here or even reaccelerate,  which is the fed's concern.  labor market --  >> meghan, i want to make time  to talk about this.  your pick for today.  what is your pick and why?  >> my pick is banks.  this is another sort of, i  think win/win for the year  ahead.  banks were a key part of the  broadening story we saw in the  second half of last year.  we expect rates to stay  elevated.  we think short rates will come  down.  you'll get really a nice rate  environment and a steeper curve  for banks.  the thing to watch wil",

                  "And owns palantir, gentleman,  good morning, great to have you  both here.  maalik, i'm going to start off  with you.  one of the issues you have, is  the evaluation of palantir, at  150 times.  is there any other big issue  with this company, other than  this really elevated  evaluation?  >> to be very honest with you,  first of all, good morning.  to be honest, we think about  palantir's business, it is one  of the only ai places out  there.  the company business is great,  the u.s. Commercial side of the  business is actually doing  really well, and firing on all  cylinders.  our issue with palantir, as a  stock has been the evaluation.  that's what we highlighted over  the last few quarters, the  evaluation is getting out of  hand.  especially if you think about  trying to take into the stock  price, those are some very  optimistic assumptions.  >> derek, i want to come over  to you.  palantir was a black box, it  wasn't clear what they did.  now they expanded out to  commercial work.  we're talking about this  evaluation, and just the  potential they could have with  u.s. And global companies  looking to upgrade themselves  with ai.  do you believe the evaluation  is over stretched as well?  >> oh, well thank you for  having me.  we at krane shares, while the  current are optimistic.  palantir could become the gold  operating system for ai, we're  talking about potential  trillion dollar market.  now palantir is the key holding  in kraneshares.  infrastructure, and ai coin to  applications.  what is really exciting is how  the deployment is really taking  off in the enterprise world.  seeing real benefits.  better efficiency, and business  creating ai adoption, palantir  stands out in this space.  their ai platform, their system  is a game changer.  it brings together data, logic,  and action, in a way both  humans and ai can actually work  together.  but the ai platform is  topnotch.  security features, which is  crucial for companies to adopt  ai safely.  also palantir's business, the  trump administration is really  prioritizing efficiency and  digital transformation.  this could be a startup trend,  potentially bringing palantir  in the future.  >> maalik, back over to you.  evaluation, you're expecting  revenue growth and other things  to kind of meet that  evaluation.  do you agree with derek had to  say, this company has more  upside than we have seen last  year?  340% gain.  because derek seems to be  saying they have proprietary  software that other people  can't quite match.  >> first of all, i think i  agree with derek's point about  them having competitive  advantage.  when we look at our method, we  do, now as it relates to, as  you said, evaluations are  forward-looking, i would again  sort of put that question back,  what do you need to believe  about the top or the margin  profile for this business over  a five, ten-year time period  for you to get $70 or $80, as  it was illustrating a few days  ago, dollar per share  evaluation.  i tried to conduct a reverse  dcf, where you bake in what  assumptions would get you to  the stock price.  and the numbers i got would  have put palantir ahead of all  the software company asks out  there.  you have a ten-year around 30%.  you would have margin profile  gap, operating north f 55%.  if that is the assumption you  have over a ten-year period,  you could buy the stock at $80.  but when we're looking at our  own assumption, again, they are  very optimistic.  they factor ",

                  "You and i used to talk  transports.  now you moved on to  industrials.  >> happy new year.  >> why don't we start with your  top pick.  parker, shares up 39% over the  last year.  why is this company your top  pick?  >> a high quality company.  50% revenues are exposed to  short cycle industrial  exposure.  30% of the business is  aerospace.  they have a balance sheet that  is prime to make further  acquisitions, about $12 billion  of capitol.  so, it gives us the balance of  secular growth via the  aerospace, and creative  acquisition, as well as  exposure to a short cycle  inflection, which we expect at  ubs over the next five, six  months.  we have to be patient about  that.  companiesstart reporting  results in january, we're not  going to be pointing to a  massive acceleration in short  cycle.  the leading indicators are  pointing in that direction,  whether it's small business  optimism.  so we're optimistic here that  if you had me back on in march  or april, we're talking about a  different tune.  >> all right, you just  mentioned manufacturing.  that has been lagging, we'll  say, i think there was one  month that was an outlier,  tipped over to expack.  mostly in contraction.  when do you see that turning  around and how important is  that to names?  are there other tail wednesdays  or manufacturing a key metric  to watch?  >> you're absolutely right.  the industrial economy has been  in resession, if you can  believe it or not, for the last  two plus years.  it's the longest stretch of  contraction.  you would expect that to  improve at some point.  interest rates matter.  there's an inverse  relationship.  the election is positive and  the psychology as you can see  in small business optimism.  so, it's a short cycle, low  visibility.  we'll see.  again, manufacturing is close  to 50.  it's been below 50 for two  years.  small business optimism saw a  surge from november to  december, and so we're quite  optimistic that over the next  couple months, the industrial  economy, as measured by the  manufacturing, will go from  contraction to growth.  the question is, what's the  magnitude of that improvement?  we'll see that over the course  of the next six months.  government policy has a lot to  do with that.  we are optimistic.  the other tail wednesday is ai  and data centers.  a lot of that infrastructure  that needs to be put up is  exposed to electric components.  that's another huge tail wind  for the industry.  >> we were talking about  quantum computing.  is there a tie-in with quantum  computing and industrials right  now?  >> there's a tie-in between ai  and industrials.  you can see with train  technologies.  there is an exposure, more  directly, i would call that  honey well, it's a 54% stake in  a private quantum computing  company.  we'll see what the evaluation  of that, the last evaluation  round was $2 billion.  there's about $4 per share of  value baked into honey well's  iyty equity value.  it needs massive amount of  infrastructure.  this is da",

                  "Welcome back to squawk box.  welcome back to marcus.  we are looking at her chief  investment strategist.  good morning.  we have been wanting this  uniquely strange situation.  quantum computing in the  context of nvidia, and other  a.i.  darlings, and  the bitcoin risk  on or rest off ramp.  >> it has been a struggle.  it makes sense.  when you look at investor  positioning, they are at an  impasse.  you have the same percentage of  bulls versus bears.  there are two factors battling  it out right now.  on the one hand, you have a  positive story of artificial  intelligence that is carrying  itself into 2025.  yet the story of solid earnings  we expect for the quarter.  that has been taken into context of what we could get from the  fed and the new trump  administration.  that is creating some  volatility.  given that set up and the  markets have not removed enough  risk just yet, that is what we  had to go through.  let's go through this battle.  >> that is a euphemism for go  down?  >> that's right.  >> we have seen a bit of that  at the end of last year.  we saw the markets pulled back  2% or 3%.  we saw hedge funds at shorts.  we saw systematic investors  going through a wave of selling  and some private clients may  have done that as well.  i don't think we have seen  enough of that.  we are not at oversold levels.  we might have a share of new  one-month flows of the s&p that  is higher than normal, but i  don't think we have seen  enough.  i can say, this is the time to  jump into the market.  we have to be patient in  january and have the actors  battling out.  on the days we have policy  -induced uncertainty, like  yesterday, you look at the  things to buy.  maybe not quantum computers.  >> what do you looked buy?  to make the first big theme is  artificial intelligence.  it is carrying itself into 2025. The last 2 years have been  about semi conductors.  this year has to be about a.i.  software and modernization.  it also to be about a.i.  power.  is not just a number of  headlines talking about data  centers and how much they  consume.  and you need a times the  electricity to run and a.i.  center, it is a real trend.  the trump administration will  support this as well.  for that would be the additional investment in data centers.  outlook to a.i.  software and a.i.  power themes. Broadly, i would  look to alternatives.  one thing we talked about in  the outlook as if you expect  this to be the year of broader  outcomes and higher volatility  in the public markets, that's  why you may want to have that  he's in your portfolio of the  private markets where you have  typically higher risk adjusted  returns and less volatility  with more insulation.  >> is is the vintage?  are you going to look back, in  the alternative world where you  are playing private markets,  the reason there is a  volatility is because you don't  get to see the volatility.  for you to see the marks on a  quarterly basis.  it's for sure, but five to 7  years from now, do you look  back and say well, this was a  great time to get in?  >> i think that is one of those  years.  2021 was clearly not that here.  if you sent in a private equity  or venture capital, you did so  at high valuations.  we don't have that anymore.  were not at the same rock- bottom evaluations that we saw  in 2022 and 2023.  if you look at private equity,  they are trained below. It is a  decent point to step in.  for investors that have an  allocation for private equity  or they can purchase a second  during the middle-market buyout , with they can benefit from,  the pickup in activity that ",

                  "Founder and managing director.  an investment consulting firm.  greg, good morning, always  great to see you.  >> good morning.  >> i want to start things off  with a sound bite last night  and see if you agree or  disagree.  >> we know the fed can't raise  rates.  that would make them look like  total idiots.  after we get a report and  interest rates go higher,  plenty of people say stocks got  ahead of themselves.  there are others who know only  one thing, if rates are going  higher, then we're headed for a  burst of inflation that will  send stocks lower.  >> so, greg, kramer's thesis,  higher bond yields.  it followed that read, agree  with that.  with yields the benchmark.  will that continue to put  pressure on equities?  >> i agray with that notion.  i disagree with the notion that  it is epistotic.  when we look at the inflation  read, frank, you will know,  many of us have been concerned  about what is just happening  organically.  we saw core go from 0 basis  points in june, 10 in july, 20  in august, followed by three 30  point reads and possibly a 40  point december.  both things oppose a head wind  for equities.  the organic rise of rates  fueled by deficit spending,  fueled by less of an appetite  in china, japan, potentially  others.  also, the reinsurgence, given  some of the administration  policy objectives and what that  may force the fed to do.  >> all right, part of that  thesis is investors are  counting on rate cuts going  forward.  i want to talk to you about the  fed.  this is an interesting idea  that you have here.  the feds on pace for a moment,  explain that.  your idea here is running  contrary to what kramer just  said.  what is this moment that you  think is coming up?  >> yeah, so, it harkins back to  1979 and '81.  they declared a premature  victory against inflation, and  had to come back in 1981 and  raise rates almost to 20%, far  higher than he had to do the  first time.  so while i don't want to  necessarily be alarmist and  ring the bell on something of  that nature, i do believe the  evidence is being put in that  we probably or most of us, some  of us did not.  most of us probably declared a  premature end to inflation, and  that battle was over.  the data, likely the jobs data,  the core cpi data over the last  five months, points to a  resurgence in inflation.  that is without the  inflationary platter of policy  that the administration  proposed.  >> first and foremost, thank  you.  made a little mistake on my  end.  that's a great reference, greg.  i want to get to the point of  your thesis.  you think the fed would raise  rates?  it might have been something  you said before that, but he  said the fed would lose their  credibility if they raise  rates.  do you see that as a real  possibility going forward?  >> i do see it as plausible.  this is not about a choice.  if any of us had a choice, we  would prefer for rates to stay  lower and we would prefer for  the cutting program to  continue.  i think if it is to become a  reality, the fed simply won't  have a choice.  we start to get into mass  deportation, trade wars and  tariffs, deficits, cuts on  taxes.  i think you're going to see a  very acute inflation and the  fed won't have a choice.  you have seen two governors  come out and say that they  decent from even last month's  cut.  so, you know, i think at the  very least, we're going to see  a pause.  i'm going to refrain from  saying it's likely that we see  a raise, because by the time  that becomes evident, it become  accepted that the feds have no  choice.  >> i want to ask you about a  red hot sector on the markets  over the last couple of months.  i know you're not a tech  analyst.  big upside moves when it comes  to stocks.  yesterday, comments from jen  son won, leading the whole  basket to decline double  digits.  when we see a hype cycle, what  does that do to market  sentiment?  what does that do to the market  action in your mind?  most people would afree, we're  around ai, quantum cop pouting  was supposed to be the next big  thing.  >> right.  i don't know if we're in a  height cycle, right?  because in terms of ai, we have  seen the companies putting up  the earnings growth.  we have seen the 50% earnings  growth.  while some look at the  multiples and say they are  stretched.  if you're going to give me 30%  earnings growth over the next  three years consistently, then  that's worth multiple.  so i think jenson's comments  had a natural impact in many  thought we would see the same  type of earnings s-curve within  the next five or six years and  that was worth waiting around  for.  is that worth waiting around  for if it's 20 years away?  probably not.  better places to deploy  capital.  so",

                  "Believe it. But what we're interested in is  we want to help the industry get there as fast as possible.  >>> that was nvidia ceo jensen  huang with his outlook on the  quantum computing timeline. Shares of nvidia rebounding  slightly this morning after  sliding more than 6% yesterday. By the way, what he said about  quantum computing managed to  take out a lot of those quantum  computing stocks, some of the  smaller ones like ion q, quantum computing, rigetti. Joining us is joe moore. I want to get your take on this. I've been heading a lot of  stuff. I mean, after jensen huang made  his comments the night before  last we actually saw shares a  little higher in the morning. Maybe not by a lot, but it  certainly wasn't giving back the pullback we saw later in the  day. There were a lot of the tech  stocks and other big high flyers that pulled back, though, after  we got stronger than expected  jobs numbers, just in terms of  what the bls had in terms of  jobs openings, those jolts  numbers. That had people suspect that go  maybe the fed is going to be to  be more reluctant to cut rates  anytime soon and that caused all of these big high flyers to  pullback. Do you think the pullback in  nvidia shares yesterday was more related to what jensen huang did or didn't say or more related to the overall idea of watching the federal reserve and seeing how  the economy is doing? >> i mean, i think both of those play a role. Ces is a tradeshow around  consumer and automotive.  there is important information  i came out around those  markets.  this is 85% of the revenue.  the maven expectations of  people wanted to hear more  about that.  we have some of those issues.  overall, this is still a company in a strong product cycle.  data center was not the focus,  it is investor focused.  it is a combination of the  market issues that you talked  about as well as some  expectations around the  tradeshow.  there was nothing negative to  take away.  >> one of these in terms of the  data center that the street  would really like to hear?  another revenue is expected for  the year to come in at $113  billion, ramping up of north of  $200 billion for the fiscal  year that does end in january  2027.  what people want to hear?  >> expectations are high.  we are two months into the  blackwell cycle and the new  products they started shipping.  today we would get any color on  incremental blackwell products  was probably not going to  happen.  this was not the forum for that  anyway.  from a product standpoint, we  know everything that we need to  know.  from a revenue standpoint, you  are facing a bit of a  transition.  you have blackwell demand that  is very good.  you heard the comments from  jensen huang about the level of  blackwell demand being insane.  he did not repeat those  comments.  the issue you are dealing with  is blackwell demand is strong.  it is supply constrained.  hopper, the legacy product is  the largest portion of the data  center business.  they will have a couple of  quarters here where there is  meaningful upside.  the real upside is in the back  half of the year when you get  that full-blown blackwell ramp.  people would like to hear that.  i think they did hear that in  some sense.  they are trying to avoid the  really strong statements about  blackwell, because it is not  the main driver of the quarter.  that is the combination of  blackwell at hopper.  i am optimistic about how this  plays out.  i do see the upside being  stronger in the second half of  the year.  for with the stock that has  done so well, triple last year,  how much is priced in?  where are you telling people is  a price target were people  should feel comfortable?  to this is less about the  phenomenon that the stock has  been in more on valuing a  growth company on his growth  prospects.  the stock trades at 29 times  the estimate for 2026.  that would be high if there  were any deceleration of the  business.  i don't think there is, even  through the transitional  challenges.  administer the issues, you are  beating the numbers and they  are likely to move higher.  i still think the stock is  reasonably valued with good  growth prospects here an",

                  "STAGE TALKS TO RAISE AS MUCH AS  $2 BILLION AT A $60 BILLION  VALUATION. CNBC HAS LEARNED THAT THE  FUNDING ROUND IS BEING LED BY  LIGHT SPEED VENTURES. ANTHROPIC IS A CREATOR OF AN AI  CHATBOT CALLED CLAUDE. THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER  IF OpenAI ULTIMATELY IS OWNED BY MICROSOFT, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF  THAT'S A THOUGHT THAT ANTHROPIC  WOULD LAND UP IN THE HANDS OF -- WE TALKED TO LINA KHAN AND I  SORT OF THOUGHT SHE WAS HINT  THAT GO MAYBE WE WOULD HEAR  ABOUT THEIR INVESTIGATION  INQUIRY INTO ALL OF THIS STUFF  AND/OR MAYBE EVEN A SUIT.  >> THAT WAS WEIRD. THE IDEA -- YOU POINTED OUT,  WHAT IS IT, 12 DAYS NOW UNTIL -- >> AS OF YESTERDAY SHE WAS  COUNTING -- IT WAS EIGHT  BUSINESS DAYS.  >> SO REALLY? I GUESS WE WILL SEE.  >> WE WILL SEE. AND THEN THE QUESTION IS  WOULD -- YOU KNOW, DOES THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION TAKE UP THE CASE? INTERESTINGLY THE ORIGINAL  GOOGLE CASE BROUGHT BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND, YOU KNOW,  NOT HER DEPARTMENT BUT THE DOJ  CONTINUED THAT CASE. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. >> I GUESS IT GETS WEIRD IN THE  TECH WORLD BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT CLEAR GUIDELINES AS TO WHAT EACH ADMINISTRATION THINKS. IT DOESN'T FALL INTO THE OLD  KIND OF CAMPS OF WHAT YOU WOULD  THINK A REPUBLICAN VERSUS A  DEMOCRAT WOULD DO. THERE IS SOME CROSSOVER ON SOME  OF THESE THINGS AND YOU POINTED  IT OUT WITH J.D. VANCE.  >> TRUMP WAS A BIG -- ORIGINALLY PUSHED ON THE TIKTOK POSITION  AND NOW, YOU KNOW -- AND THEN  BIDEN TOOK THAT UP AND NOW IT  APPEARS -- WE WILL SEE WHAT  HAPPENS.  >> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.  >> HE HAS MADE COMMENTS  OBVIOUSLY THAT HE MAY NOT WANT  TO KILL THAT PRODUCT.  >>> A BATTLE OVER THE FATE OF  U.S. STEEL PLAYED OUT ON CNBC  YESTERDAY. THE COMPANY'S CEO DAVID BURRITT  APPEARED ON \"SQUAWK ON THE  STREET\" AND ACCUSED PRESIDENT  BIDEN OF TAINTING THE REVIEW  PROCESS FOR NIPPON STEEL'S  PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF U.S. STEEL. >> REMARKABLE DEAL AND THAT'S  WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. WE'RE TRYING TO RIGHT THE WRONGS OF THIS PRESIDENT AND MAKE SURE  THAT CFIUS IS ACTUALLY FOLLOWED. THE PROCESS HAS BEEN CORRUPT. YOU KNOW IT. I MEAN, LET'S FACE  IT. GOD KNOWS THAT THIS PROCESS HAS  BEEN TAINTED FROM THE VERY  BEGINNING AND WE NEED TO FIX IT. >> BURRITT'S POINT WAS THAT  PRESIDENT BIDEN IN BEING SO  OUTSPOKEN AGAINST THIS WAS  TELLING BASICALLY THE PEOPLE ON  CFIUS TO VOTE AGAINST IT BEFORE  THEY EVEN SAW ANY OF THIS. BURRITT WENT ON TO CALL FOR  PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP TO TAKE A  FRESH LOOK AT THE DEAL. IT WAS POINTED OUT TO HIM  REPEATEDLY THAT INCOMING  PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS NOT IN FAVOR OF THIS DEAL, EITHER, AND  CAMPAIGNED ON THAT PRETTY  HEAVILY, BUT HE SAID -- I THINK  SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES -- I  WAS LISTENING TO THE  INTERVIEW -- HE SAID SOMETHING  ALONG THE LINES OF PRESIDENT  TRUMP IS A VERY SMART MAN, I  THINK I CAN APPEAL TO HIM TO  MAKE THIS REALIZE THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. HE WOULD LIKE TO TALK WITH HIM  AND TALK THAT THROUGH. LATER IN THE DAY ON \"MAD MONEY\"  THE CEO OF CLEVELAND-CLIFFS  FIRED BACK. CLEVELAND-CLIFFS WAS A RIVAL  BIDDER FOR U.S. STEEL AND  REPEATEDLY CAST DOUBT ON THE  DEAL'S PROSPECTS TO INVESTORS. LISTEN IN. >> THE STATEMENTS COMING FROM  THE CEO OF U.S. STEEL CALLED THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  CORRUPT. AS AN AMERICAN I FEEL OFFENDED. THIS IS JUST ABSURD. >> BY THE WAY, THE U.S. STEEL  CEO BURRITT HAD ALSO CLAIMED  THAT CLEVELAND-CLIFFS WAS BEHIND SOME OF THIS, TOO, AND THAT  THEY'VE BEEN GOING AFTER THEM  FOR THE ISSUES ON THIS, TOO. SHARES OF U.S. STEEL ARE DOWN  ABOUT 15% SINCE THE DEAL WAS  FIRST ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER OF  2023. OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF QUESTIONS  STILL TO PLAY OUT IF THERE WOULD BE A REVIEW OF THE CFIUS  VERSION -- VISION ON THIS,  WHETHER INCOMING PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD CHANGE HIS MIND ON ANY OF  THESE THINGS, WHETHER THERE  WOULD BE ANOTHER BID FROM  CLEVELAND-CLIFFS, IF NOT, AND  WHETHER U.S. STEEL WOULD  CONSIDER ANY OF THES",
