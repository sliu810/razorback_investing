      "    \"the key thing for all of us as investors is how do we protect ourselves against government driven monetary inflation and history has one asset that always delivers over the long term and that's the gold price gold is always a fantastic monetary hedge another one could be and I'm putting inverted comment could be cryptocurrencies particularly Bitcoin because Bitcoin has has demonstrated in The Last 5 Years ability to keep Pace or more than keep Pace with the monetary inflation we've [Music] had hey this is Alex clean's at the growth Manifesto podcast in this episode we'll talk with Michael Hal he's the author of The book's Capital Wars and investing in emerging markets and he's the leading Authority on global liquidity worldwide he's worked in finance for over 30 years and was the research director at Solomon Brothers where he developed the concept of global liquidity in this episode we talk about how Global liquidity works the challenge that the US has with their debt the growing Chinese Yuan how liquidity affects the crypto markets including Bitcoin and what you can do to protect yourself from an increasingly volatile economic landscape I hope you enjoy this episode and make sure to subscribe to get the latest episodes as soon as they're released how are you today Michael pretty well thanks doing well here great and so you're based in the UK right exactly yeah I can tell from the accent although I do um have a few people I work with um who are from the UK as well so it is good to know that yes you're across the world look this is going to be a an interesting conversation because I don't think there's that many professionals outside of the finance industry understand liquidity at the global level right and I know that the approach which you have is quite unique and I've spoken to a few people in the industry and they speak so highly of you and so I wanted to start by just unpacking the definition of global liquidity and just for the listeners like I'm going to be speaking about this from someone outside the finance industry and so I'm going to be asking simple questions and I'm going to be there on the path with you all great okay thanks first thing to say is that liquidity is basically a measure of something like money okay so think of it in that way but it's money which is specifically circulating in financial markets and I think what you've got to do increasingly is to differentiate what goes on in financial markets or asset markets generally from what's going on in the real economy and we've evolved into a sit situation where Finance is basically running economies rather than economies running finance and if you look at textbooks and the conventional wisdom it says that what we've got is a situation where economies are dominant and finance are the servants if you like of the Masters which are the economy it's now the other way around uh Finance is the master and the economy is very much the servant or it gets the crumbs from the table and the whole world has sort of shifted its polarity there's been aming major polarity shift and what I would go on to say is that if you look at the whole nature of financial markets they very much changed their complexion if you pick up a finance or an economics textbook or do economics 101 what you're taught is that Capital markets are there to raise Finance for new investment okay in other words interest rates are the governing price if interest rates are too high there's not enough Finance for Capital spending the economy slows Etc we're in a very different world we're in a world now where there's not that much Capital spending uh or what capital spending there is is being done by state Enterprises in China we're in a world where there's huge amounts of debt refinancing going on we've got a refinance debt there is 350 trillion dollars of debt out there in the world economy and what that means is that that debt which has an average lifespan of about 5 years needs to be refinanced frequently so every year you've got an average of 70 trillion that the financial markets need to refinance Okay so we've shifted from a world of new capital raising to rollovers or refinancings okay and just think of that in a very simple example like a home mortgage so if you got to refinance your home mortgage after 25 years say you're not that interested so much in what the interest rate is you're going to pay on that refinancing what you're desperate to get is the role you want to find a lender that's going to lend to you again for another 25 years or whatever okay and that focuses the mind if you don't get that role you're homeless okay if a corporation doesn't roll its debt it defaults so in a world of massive debt it's about refinancing now if you got this whopping great amount of debt to refinance $70 trillion uh which is you know the world economy let's say to put that in perspective is about $120 trillion of GDP so we're looking at almost rolling the entire G DP every year of the world in terms of this new of debt refinancing what you need is balance sheet capacity to do that okay it's not the interest rate that governs it it's the capacity of the financial system to do the role the balance sheet capacity and that is what we think about as liquidity so in other words how much Financial capacity does the do the financial markets have it's similar in a way to money supply but it's much much bigger it's a much broader concept and it focuses is specifically on the financial sector and what's more it's Global because money in that sense is fungible so you could get your home mortgage financed by an American bank or maybe you possibly a British bank or this got any money left or an Aussie bank so it's a global concept does that make sense it does make sense and I'm going to be talking about this a fair bit right now how does your approach differ from the the global Equity Index right because that basically has a look at all the central banks and how much money that they're holding but I know that you look at things a bit differently and so your approach is a bit more uh kind of accurate I would say because are you look for additional things that are outside of what the normal person can see so how does your approach work well okay let let me um step back the first thing to say is we don't put a lot of a lot of importance on interest rates unfortunately or fortunately depending on which way you look at it the media and the central banks are getting us to focus 100% of our time on interest rate movements it's all about what the fed's going to do with rates what the uh Reserve Bank of alls is going to do with rates all these questions they're the they they're the talking points but they're kind of irrelevant really in the in the big scheme of things what really matters is this debt pile and how this debt pile is refinanced and so what you need is the uh is the ability to create liquidity in the system and let me stress again what we're looking at here is funding liquidity because there is a concept that Finance people think of as liquidity being a measure of Market debt in other words they're looking at the other end of the pipeline they're thinking Market liquidity we're fundamentally looking here at what we think of as funding liquidity access to funding that's the key point that drives Market liquidity but it's an earlier stage now in terms of in terms of that Dynamic we therefore wanted to understand how that liquidity has been created it can be created by central banks they're very instrumental in doing that okay now let me give an example which may be a slightly wonkish example but let me let me try and do that one of the things that the Federal Reserve and many other central banks have been arguing for the last 18 months is that they've been doing what is called quantitative tightening in other words they've been shrinking the size of their balance sheets because for some reason they say big balance sheet equals bad even though we were told whatever it was 3 or 4 years ago big balance sheet was good so they now come to the idea big balance sheet bad so they're trying to shrink it in fact if you drill into the data what you find is the active parts of the balance sheet the bits that really create liquidity in the system because all of the balance sheet doesn't only certain line items are liquidity creating those liquidity creating Parts have been expanding for the last 18 months so despite the fact they've been saying hey guys we're tightening we're tightening the system we're shrinking our balance sheet they're actually injecting liquidity in the system now that was largely triggered by two big events in the world financial system number one was the British guilt debacle in other words when the sovereign debt markets when AWOL after the Prime Minister uh Liz trust came in and decided she was going to rewrite the rules that was number one that spooked Finance Ministries and uh you know Central Bankers worldwide and what the FED began to do then was to stop taking liquidity out of the the system they began to Flatline their liquidity injections and then you got the svb situation in March February March of of last year Silicon Valley Bank went bust and you know that began to spread into the regional banks credit s first Boston fail uh that was merged into UPS beginnings of banking problems and what the Federal Reserve then did was explicitly to increase the size of its liquidity injections and what's been happening pretty much ever since is liquidity has been expanding in the US system but also generally in the global system now if you look at that inflation point or that shift from around October of 2022 that's largely when the bull market in Risk assets began so they've been key another factor you've got to take into account is it's not just about central banks of course there are other forces out there one of those is private Banks and the extent to which private banks in other words commercial Banks uh investment Banks can actually lend on the back of collateral now let me just explain that bit because that's a Nuance I don't want to get too much in the weeds here but let let me try it in the pre2 2008 situation in other words before the global financial crisis there was a lot of lending on trust within the world economy so you're a bank a I'm a bank b i' l to you I believe you I trust you okay that interbank market was huge the problem is is after 2008 trust disappeared and what you needed was collateral so I'm only going to lend to you if you can post good collateral to me in other words you got a Government Bond for example which I I've got a claim one and then I'll lend to you I'll basically do a a maturity transformation I'll lend to you short term and you'll post a bond to me so now the bulk of borrowing just again think of the Home Mortgage example that's collateralized borrowing but it now extends across pretty much the entire system there's very little unback lending going on and what that means is that the value of collateral is important to the whole liquidity and credit system so the other Wrinkle in this whole thing is it's not just the central banks is if the value of collateral changes or it becomes more uncertain that will also change the Dynamics so you've got these two big forces really coming together and the ideal world as it happens from a liquidity and an investment point of view is if the central banks are basically easing and that's normally a situation A when you've got banking problems in the world or you've got a situation where economies are lackluster and central banks are trying to Goose what is a sluggish economy that's the ideal situation okay so you don't want very strong economies and that's the great Paradox in finance strong economies don't have strong financial markets it's actually weak economies that tend to have good financial markets because the central banks are trying to Goose them higher Goose the economy higher and the other thing is if you've got stable Bond markets in particular the volatility in the bond market is actually low because that means that collateral values are a lot more certain uh if you've got very stable bond prices so those are the two levers if you like of the of the system collateral and central banks does that make sense it does make sense I am going to ask a few questions that Probably sounds super simple to you but I do need to kind of make sure that everything I guess makes sense for myself and also for the listeners right um especially as we're not Finance professionals the first one is so is global liquidity the money supply across the world is that a simple way to think about it is it it's a total funding yes please yeah sorry the the simple way to think about it is it's the element of money supply that is in the financial markets okay it's not the bit that's in the real economy now I'm going to go on and say something a little bit just to embroider that a tad right what people Define as money supply is normally Bank deposits in retail Banks Retail Bank deposits in High Street Banks okay so what's in Commonwealth Bank in other words what you deposit in Commonwealth Bank uh basically is part of money supply what is outside of money supply is actually the bits that really matter to the financial uh Market which is wholesale money in other words we're thinking we're thinking of money suppli being more retail based but you've got a wholesale own as well now that it really does get stuck in the weeds so that's basically things you know rather like uh repo Market activity Etc uh which can be driving the system so that that can be you know uh Finance to finance transactions that's a kind of a gray area in a sense where it's a very wonkish area but that is an important element in understanding what liquidity is but if you think about it as the broad money supply that is vested in the financial system that's a good definition understand understand and so there's the money in the banks and then there's essentially like everything in the wholesale markets in terms of the size of it yes what is the proportion between are the money supply like and the wholesale Market okay the the the number that we have for Global liquidity is about $170 trillion okay and the amount that's in the real economy is probably something nearer about 70 something of that of that magnitude so what you're looking at is a is a an agro good which is probably around three times as big two to three times as big so what changes the expansion or the contraction of the global liquidity well it really comes down as I said to those two two levers it's what the central banks are doing or it's what happens it's what happens to the pool of collateral those are major drivers now there's also you could argue on top of that risk-taking activity by the commercial Banks or the wholesale Banks or whatever that will come into it but that largely depends on actually you know a stimulus from the central bank so in other words uh these these players will be a lot more Keen Keen to lend if they think the central banks have got lots putting lots of cash in the system equally if you've got collateral values which seem to be very solid uh and Rising as lender as a financial system lender you're going to be more you're going to be Keener to lend so you tend to find that you've got this base if you like this primary base of liquidity uh which is the central bank and collateral and that tends to drive lending in financial markets through the system so Global liquidity seems to be the most accurate uh measure of the future economic state of specific countries it seems is like as ask first of all like is that a correct statement because I speak to like a lot of people like in the finance industry and they always start with liquidity and then they go down from there and so liquidity seems to be the macro uh driver of growth for specific asset classes and so on is this a correct statement like and I'm just going to continue to put statements out there feel free to shut me down and say incorrect it's possible it has an effect in the way that you say but I think I don't think you can get away from the fact that what's really driving the real economy in terms terms of the trend in the real economy is what we all know and love like Enterprise productivity you know what small business are doing Innovation all these sort of supply side factors are really what's driving an economy uh in other words you know if you look at an economy like Britain where you where all those factors are kind of going downwards at the moment where you've got limiting Innovation you've got low Enterprise you've got everyone's mood is very depressed and all that sort of thing by chucking liquidity at the system you're not really going to revive things you look at America where there's a much more Dynamic uh or Oz where people actually want to make money there's a lot of Enterprise Innovation Etc uh if you put liquidity into that you're going to improve the situation by sure for sure but you're not going to change the underlying Trends um you know and that that's really the key thing liquidity will affect the cycle but it won't affect the underlying Trend uh of economies and that's what I think you've got to draw that distinction uh in terms of what I'm saying so if you got if you got a situation for example where uh let's take the us right now where you've got probably a strong underlying Trend in the economy okay well certainly a lot stronger than many other uh regions because of the innovation technology of the US system and you start throwing money at it uh so you start expanding Global liquidity or liquidity expands then what you've got is a situation where you're going to get an increase and acceleration in growth but it's going to be a business cycle move so that business cycle is effectively going to be driven by the pool of liquidity now the interesting point is contrast that with what the textbooks tell us or what our experience was maybe three or four decades ago three or four decades ago where economies were much more manufacturing based where you had capital expenditure which a big item so in other words uh businessman were thinking about you know building a new Chemical Works or uh a steel steel works or whatever it may be very Capital intensive spending then that was also driving the business cycle in other words in the traditional textbook way the capex cycle is dominant or the inventory cycle is dominant that's not really the case anymore what you've got is a very different Dynamic and now it's a situation where the financial markets tend to drive the real economies and they tend to drive the real economies through wealth effects okay so in other words that what happens the mechanism now is kind of different is that what you'd see is the financial sector will expand so let's say the central banks uh get spooked by a banking crisis they start to throw liquidity at the system uh the system reifies uh asset markets tend to get F the you know the the the nice wind warm wind behind them of of more liquidity they go up in price there's a wealth effect generated and consumers and businesses to the extent that they're involved too will actually feel their wealth Rising so they're going to spend more and that then drives the economy through that mechanism so I think you've got a very different Dynamic it's now much more the financial markets Drive the business cycle than the business cycle drives the financial markets and the sequence is liquidity First Financial Market second real economies third you mentioned before that production is a really important part of the of the economic drivers right but then the same time the business cycle is led by the financial markets right so is it it's so it's a bit like the Chicken and the Egg right because it sounds like if Finance is leading the economies but the economies actually have to produce something there's like an interact our relationship between the two right and so how does the average person understand is what's happening in the world right now you know between I say for example the excessive debt of the US and you know like all the concerns that are happening uh with the downfall of the dollar and the rise of thean right like there's all this stuff happening um happening at the moment to the bre and so on right and there's all this kind of instability and volatility right now ah there's Wars going on yeah there's this there's so much happening right now is this thing happening across the global scale is it starting from liquidity again like is this a component of that like is this almost like a response to what's been happening in terms of the size of the debt and the refinancing of the debt and the fact that China is actually the one who's investing in capital um and then everyone else is kind of just refinancing their debts well the short answer is yes uh and Global liquidity is the one that's actually the driver right now for all this instability happening across the world well a part of the drivers of what's Happening across the world to understand to understand what's happening you definitely need to understand what's happening in terms of liquidity absolutely 100% correct but if you come back to why is global liquidity uh you know doing what it's doing it comes back to this depth situation and understanding how the shape of the world economy has changed now what I said is that if you look at economic textbooks they give you a very different model of how the world works it's all about Capital spending the capital spending drives the business cycle Etc interest rates are important that world has gone okay and that world changed really because of two big factors number one uh is China okay so China came in muscled in uh what you've got is you know the the world economy uh pre the fall of the Berlin wall and the opening up of China uh was a labor force of probably what two billion in the west or generally of that Workforce of that amount that more than doubled with the entry of Eastern Europe Russia China India this you know this globalization if you like uh was a huge supply shock to the world now what that meant was a lot of Western industry basically became uh competitively challenged and relative to China unproductive or less productive so all the new investment was going into the East whereas the West was suffering and there was no incentive to invest because the Returns on Capital dropped away so in other words to keep going a lot of companies began to borrow more money so debt began to explode economies uh were still very lackluster so governments came in and government started to spend money I mean look at the escalation of debt in Japan for example after the bubble burst uh their debt GDP is iew watering numbers I to over 250% for example okay the these are big big big scary numbers uh and then what you've also got on top on top of that is that aging demographics the other big factor is meaning that consumer spending is probably challenged because you haven't got the younger cohorts who are doing new household formation and lots of spending and you know the old the older Generations don't spend that much or they spend on different things so the economies tend to slow down and that was another uh case evidence by Japan so again what you need is more debt to keep the economies rolling so what we've had in the last two decades is a huge accumulation of debt now that's Point number one help that thought the second thing to say is that as I said right at the beginning debt has to be refinanced so what you've got to do is to roll the debt periodically uh you know you can't borrow unless you're borrowing uh you know for with a Perpetual Bond you can't borrow forever okay you have a term so I issue a bond or I borrow from a bank for three years I issue a bond for five years for 10 years or whatever but I got to roll that over I got to refinance I got to come back to the market Now spoiler alert debt is never repaid that was what I was going to ask right like if it continues to increase like how does this ever kind of end you know but I cut you off this is the second that's that's a brilliant Point that's the question we've all G to ask because debt is accumulating now the worrying D Dynamic that is coming in here is that if you start to look at fiscal situations in the world take America I mean America is is in many ways the cleanest shirt in the laundry when it comes to fiscal problems uh compared with Europe uh Britain uh I mean Oz is actually in a pretty good shape because of the the demograph backdrop but uh uniquely perhaps Japan is I mean Japan is in a bad way but what these countries basically have is a sharp deterioration in their budget deficits okay in other words think of America and use America as an example because it's very transparent and the Americans are very open with the data and they project the data out you know 50 years ahead so hey we got a pretty good Benchmark but look at what's happening in America okay and you think of these of these Dynamics number one is you got an aging population now America is not aging anything like as fast as Europe's but in America they've got to start paying up enormous amounts for Medicare and for Social Security we just think about Europe in that context that's going to be massively worse right you've got also an increase in defense spending which is slated because of all these geopolitical tensions so that's another Factor you got to add to it and then you got a third factor is which of the presidential candidates is going to raise taxes neither of them just forget that I mean the society is so polarized that you simply can't say I'm going to raise taxes because you'll get a marginal swing or a significant swing to the other side and you're going to lose the election and that's why both Trump and Biden are doubling down and saying we're not going to you know raise taxes we're not going to C spending we're actually going to give you more money now who pays for that and that's the real question now America has had the luxury in the last few decades that American treasury bonds are the safe asset the sort of pristine asset that every wants to hold because they're considered to be you know absolutely safe Rock Solid China bought tons of them Japan has bought you know massive amounts of US Treasury bonds back U not even probably 10 years ago a third of America's debt was held by foreigners okay that number is coming down rapidly and that's the average holding of debt it's not the marginal buying at the margin these guys are selling the Chinese are selling their treasuries the Japanese given the problems with the Yen are likely to be selling theirs as well uh and so what you've got is the funding sources for the US are shrinking fast so they have to going to go back to their domestic domestic Savers so what you've got is a very unattractive situation now it gets worse than this and this is the thing that is you know the magic of compound interest I think wasn't it Einstein who said the know the eighth wonder of the world is compound interest and that's really the the problem you've got because basically if you start to look at the interest bill that America is paying it's now over a trillion dollars a year in other words more than they spend on defense is now being spent on interest payments just think back to 1980 when Reagan came in when vulka was at the Federal Reserve when us interest rates were 15% right but the debt GDP ratio in America public debt GDP was 25% so even you had 15% interest rates the interest bill on the debt was small okay they could manage that quite comfortably now what we've got is interest rates a third of the size that they were in 1980 but the debt burden is five times as big so what you find is that that's starting to scale up so the interest bill now is meaningfully large and what that tells you is in other words to balance the budget with that huge interest interest Bill the US has got to go into huge primary Surplus in other words before interest payments the US Government Federal Government has got to be you know taxing more than it's spending well good luck with that one uh that's that's that's not going to happen but it get keeps getting worse because then if you start to say well okay the debt GDP ratio this year this year is 120% and then by 2050 on Congressional budget office which is the bipartisan you know neutral body in America the Mones this stuff they figure it could be 250% so you're going to pretty much double again so this interest bill is growing exponentially and the question you've got to we've all got to ask is how do they fund that now the easiest thing for politicians to do is you know wait for it Kick the Can down the road because that's what they're used to doing they don't want to raise taxes they don't want to cut spending they're going to basically fill the Gap by printing money and whether that comes directly by the central Banks saying hey look you heard of this QE thing well we're going to rename it now uh you know QE was a bad a bad name we're going to call it Qs quantitative support okay uh the Federal Reserve acronym department works overtime and they think of a new name and they call it quantitative support or something like that okay but they start to roll that out now hey look what's going on in America right now what have they announced last week they announced that they tapering their so their sorry sorry their QT program qued titting was being tapered okay they were cutting their treasury roll off from 60 billion a month to 25 okay so they're already stepping in this direction and all they need now is to say well actually we're going to start expanding the balance sheet and liquidity once more and we're going to start to buy the government debt now the problem is is if they do that or what's more they get the banks to do it you know sneakily for them because they basically start to issue more treasury bills very short dated debt that the banks buy that is what is called monetization and monetization in other words monetary inflation is what the central banks are doing they're devaluing the value of their paper money okay and they're doing that either secretly surreptitiously but they're doing it over the long term and the scale of this is eyw wateringly large now in past Cycles where you've had a hint of you know finances going wrong what the policy makers would say is hey what we're going to do is we're going to jack up interest rates right we're going to discipline the markets we're going to force them back out of equities or risk assets back into the safety of government bonds we'll get everybody in government bonds we can Finance ourselves inflation comes down uh the economy has a recession but hey that's a short-term problem uh and then we'll we'll start the whole process again but the problem is they can't do this in the future because the interest bill is so high so if they start raising interest rates now they're going to basically shoot themselves in the foot because they simply can't manage the process so what you've got going on is a lot of manipulation in the system whether it's called yield curve control they're trying to keep keep you a limit on yields government bond yields uh they're keeping interest rates lower than they probably should be uh you know all this sort of stuff they're talking about you know all this forward guidance this sort of mystical stuff they start suggesting inflation's coming down they saying hey but then you know you and I know that inflation is not what they report okay our inflation rates seem a lot higher than that well hey there's a surprise isn't there there and what you've got is this long-term inflation now the key thing for all of us as investors is how do we protect ourselves against government driven monetary inflation and history has one asset that always delivers over the long term and that's the gold price gold is always a fantastic monetary hedge and another one could be and I'm putting inverting comment could be cryptocurrencies particularly Bitcoin because Bitcoin is has demonstrated in the last five years an ability to keep Pace or more than keep Pace with the monetary inflation we've had and so what we've got to start thinking about is asset allocation in a world of what I would call fiscal dominance in other words where the central banks are the slaves of government funding so they're just doing what the governments tell them we've come through a period of several decades probably beginning with Paul vulker in America when he was uh uh when he was head of the Federal Reserve which what you could call monetary dominance where basically the central banks say like Hey we're in control we're going to Target inflation at low levels we're going to be disciplined uh the governments have got to count out to us in terms of what the fiscal deficits are doing you've got to have austerity but the central banks are in control that world is a brilliant world for the asset allocation we've all gotten Pension funds which is for 6040 mix okay 60% Equity 40% Bond hey that works right it does not work in a world of fiscal dominance in a world of fiscal dominance you don't want government debt bad idea well what you do want is at the front end of the curve and know short-term rates you want to start diversifying you want to think about real assets because they're a great monetary inflation hedge you want to think of gold and maybe you want to think of things like Bitcoin and I'll come back to the asset part shortly because um that is certainly an area which I want to touch on coming back to the US debt so now everyone's experiencing inflation so there's less money in the economy it's struggling and they're looking to kind of find a way to get themselves out of a hole which doesn't seem like it's going to happen it seems like it's significantly increasing so what happens to a country if it can't get out of debt and then if it can't actually uh cover its interest payments and if that country like is the reserve dollar of the world you know so what happens in that scenario well the answer is they can always cover their interest payment was the debt is dollarized so they can always print dollars that that's not a problem but they print the dollars but then that increases the money supply which increases inflation which lowers the economic power so it feels like that's a cycle where the population will start to suffer I say for example like Argentina right or Venezuela you know that like essentially the currencies I completely crushed and you know I think they were using it for toilet paper because it cost less to use the money than to pay for toilet paper right so like and so that kind of scenario seems scary for at least a lot of the Americans I'm talking to right and so is this a realistic scenario or not really because it seems like the US dollar because it's a reserve currency it's got some stability for you know a couple of decades at least I'd love to hear your thoughts on it yeah well I think I mean the the first thing to say is that you just think back to the the old Irish joke is if you want to travel to Dublin don't start from here the point is that you know the Lost Travelers asking how to get to Dublin the Irishman says if you want to go to Dublin don't start from here and that's the that's the issue for basically policy makers worldwide they're in a very bad place and they shouldn't be where they are but they are and we' got that and you got to face up to it now are we going to get hyperinflation like Argentina uh don't think so no or Zimbabwe or whatever I didn't think so that that's not on the agenda but we will we get higher levels of monetary inflation and I'm going to I draw the distinction which is an important one between monetary inflation and High Street inflation but I'll come back to that split are we going to get more monetary inflation yes we are it's happening already right that's the global liquidity Dynamic that we talk about that is rising and what you want to do is to basically invest in assets or bear in mind uh those assets that are most sensitive to Rising global equility that tends to be you know Blue Chip equities commodity prices real estate primary real estate obviously uh gold things like Bitcoin those are the assets that tend to be the best Hedges against the monetary inflation and monetary inflation is going up but we may be only talking about in terms of a trend growth rate a few percentage points not hundreds of percentage points but that's all that's needed we just need a little bit more and that comes back to the compound interest point is that you know over the long term uh if you're growing at a few percentage points more it adds up you get this sort of exponential growth and that that really is what maybe is is on the agenda so a bit more but not a lot more inflation is what we're really saying but then you know that matters so in other words rather than facing let's assume monetary and heer inflation are the same rather than facing 2 or 3% inflation we're all facing four five 6% inflation okay now can you accept that well yeah probably I mean it's uncomfortable for people that are on low incomes because inflation tends to hit those the hardest and if asset markets are rising in a faster clip then it creates a much bigger wealth divide but hey that's what we've been seeing anyway for the past couple of decades anyway and maybe uh there are ways of within the tax system of somehow addressing that but that's another challenge why is there a difference between High Street inflation and monetary inflation and the reason for that is that monetary inflation is part of the High Street inflation input but you can also think about what's happening to costs and you know in the last two decades we have had a lot of monetary inflation evidence Rising stock markets and asset values right but that hasn't spilled over to the High Street because we've had cost deflation from technology from China dumping cheap Goods Etc and those are the factors that come into the equation now if you roll forward and say look High Street inflation equals the cost bid plus the monetary bid if monetary inflation is running at 5% and cost deflation is running at 2% you're going to get a net impact on the High Street of 3% inflation but if your cost element suddenly swings oil prices rise technology you know slows down China starts to be inflationary you know for example then you've got a cost which may be another 2% plus your five you're up to 7% inflation already so that that's how you got to think about this and what we're saying from an investment point of view we can't help on the uh on the cost bit because that's all about the economy and the supply side but we can say you protect your assets against the monetary inflation by thinking about how you diversify against these different assets and bonds do not match inflation by definition that's good and so um for people to protect themselves against this it sounds like this type of scenario just where the economies have lots of debt and the interest payments are high and so are they PR more money and the cycle like I it continues right it seems like if you already have assets you're going to be in a much stronger position than if you don't have any assets it sounds like the wealth divide is going to increase significantly first of all is that a correct statement it's probably the case yes it's probably the case right because the more money is in the economy the more inflation goes up the more asset prices go up and the harder it is just for the average person to afford something like that and so if you're going to to look to the Future right and try to protect yourself against inflation you know say for example if you've got some cash in the bank it sounds like having cash in the bank is a bad is a bad idea right now because you'd be losing 7% uh per year if not more right because of the inflation right and so now we're going to invest in either gold or bit coin assuming that we can't afford like houses and properties and so on right for gold from what I understand about gold it's like all the central banks are holding are starting to hold all their gold and so can the average person actually invest in gold like are they just investing um into like an ETF is like an ETF safe you know like how does the average person start to now protect themselves against inflation and then we'll come ah to bitcoin because Bitcoin is obviously the easy SL the risky one depends on how you think about it but yeah how do you think about gold for kind of yeah the average person if they wanted to invest in gold well you could do it I mean you can buy a gold ETF that's that's one way of doing it uh I mean you it's clearly possible to buy bullion anyway you can buy that okay uh but it's probably inconvenient because you got to carry it on your you know by yourself or you got to store it somewhere and that clearly is a security risk so why don't you buy a u an ETF that's an easier thing to do so that that's number one or you buy gold miners I mean gold mining stocks O's got lots of those in the market it's a gold producer you know hey maybe maybe think about that so buying shares in some of these resource companies kind of makes sense I think in this in this world uh not least because we're in a world of uh geopolitical tension where if you look at those historically those periods there is a great accumulation of access to Commodities during those periods so you know commodity markets tend to go up so that's probably not a bad call I think on bitcoin it's a different question because regulation gets in the way and it's very difficult or The Regulators have made it hard to invest in some of these cryptocurrencies but clearly you can do it directly individual go directly to uh the the designated exchanges and now you've got uh ETFs on bit coin Black Rock D1 for example uh you know which is which are widely available for investors so there are other avenues that you can that you can now use the world is sort of growing uh in terms of these access to these alternative Investments so is part of the reason that Bitcoin is having such a big surge because of the global liquidity challenges right now because of the size of the debt and because it has to be refinanced every year at 70 trillion I believe you said for the fact is yes I mean that that's a key factor if you look at the data the data definitely supports that conclusion now why is it that Bitcoin is so sensitive I think it's a hard reason uh you know to to eval once you actually drill into the into the mechanics why is Bitcoin so sensitive to liquidity is a question that I find it very hard to answer but the facts speak for themselves it is now if you think of Bitcoin we we talk about it as being exponential gold because it moves rather like gold does now to give you uh some numbers and these are statistical numbers that we've evaluated looking at the data that every 10% increase in global liquidity gold tends to go up by 15% so there's a 1.5 multiplier if you look at the same analysis for Bitcoin the answer is five times multiply 50% increase for every 10% increase in global liquidity Bitcoin goes up50 % it's very very sensitive to liquidity why is it five not three not four I have no idea but the fact is it is and that's how it's that's how it's acting now clearly I say clearly probably if Global liquidity goes down 10% Bitcoin may go down 50 so it's a very volatile asset class and you've got to start thinking about it in that Dimension now that doesn't mean to say that it's you know a bad investment but you've just got to know what you're buying and you don't buy so much of it so if you think something's going to be volatile you don't put all your eggs in that basket you just buy a little bit so you might put you know 2 or 3% of your wealth in Bitcoin uh you may put 10% in Gold so what I'm saying is you got to start diversifying if you go back to the 1970s it was very very common for investors to hold gold in their investment portfolios that fell out of fashion uh as inflation came down but it's coming back uh investors are starting to move into gold now the significant point which is which people will not know unless they look at the data is who are the big marginal buyers of gold and the answer is the central banks they are accumulating but hey it's not the Reserve Bank of Australia it's not the bank of England it's not the federal it's not the Federal Reserve that's buying the gold it's the brick economies and their friends in other words it's uh it's China it's Russia uh all these this grouping and if you look at the data what you find is that these guys now own more gold collectively in this bricks Club than is in Fort Knox in America and that has they've just overtaken the US in the last quarter in the first quarter of this year the out of gold they're buying and that is moving upwards from the left hand side of the pce to the top right the line is moving upwards and they are buying more and more now what do they know that we don't I don't know but they think gold is a great asset so they're buying gold which means there's less available for retail and that is why you've got the gold part of the reason why gold is going up now what I would argue and this is maybe the wrong analogy but it's an interesting point to ponder for everybody okay let's go back to the early 1920s 100 years ago or more right and think of what was happening in Germany now Germany came out of World War I defeated and they started to print money money and that money printing created the hyperinflation now if you were the older Generations in Germany and you basically had your money in fixed income bonds right which they did you lost everything okay it was a bad bad move but they were loyal to the German government and that was their experience that Bonds were basically a safe Aid in the store of value so they kept their money in bonds the younger Generations didn't the younger Generations put their money in the stock market and the stock market skyrocketed because obviously equities businesses uh are well not exactly inflation proof but they largely move with inflation so the stock market escalated so what you saw in Germany in the early 1920s in the hyperinflation was a huge redistribution of wealth from the older generations to the younger Generations okay now we know that that that ended badly because the younger generation sided with a particular political party generally right but you get the point that that in the early 1920s I'm sure I've got nothing to substantiate this with but I feel sure that the older Generations were saying to their kids you're crazy to invest in the stock market what are you buying these are pieces of paper you know they've got no real value these corporations are Bust or whatever it may be don't waste your money isn't that exactly what we're saying to our kids with Bitcoin and all these cryptocurrencies exactly the same thing but maybe they're feeling the same wind that young Germans were feeling in the 1920s and they were saying we've got to protect our wealth here against this monetary inflation and therefore these cryptocurrencies and Bitcoins are things we really understand and we're going to put our money in there because the stock market's kind of all over the place and that's for our you know moms and dads and grandparents and we don't really figure this so they're putting the money in these new instruments and what's the difference between these things and buying papering companies maybe not a lot you don't get a dividend but so what a lot of companies don't pay dividends and so there's a direct correlation between liquidity and price of gold and the price of Bitcoin and Bitcoin is exponential compared to gold and it can go up and down the same way is the fact that Bitcoin has a fixed Supply is that a big contributor to the fact that not inflationary or deflationary it's more a protection against it probably it helps I mean that clearly is a factor I'm sure that is behind the reason that Bitcoin is attractive because you've got limited Supply or actually fixed Supply and you just had a Bitcoin harving so uh new supplies coming on at a at a much lower clip so I think all these factors basically add up you have got security and I never say never maybe there is a wrinkle somehow you know in the algorithms which mean that these things can increase in Supply but the whole point is that this space is limited allegedly uh in terms of its ability to create new Supply and whereas government paper is unlimited and the printing presses are worrying you can hear them at the moment and that that's really the problem and you know what I come back to is this whole point about debt is the big bogey that is the problem out there and we've got to refinance that debt and the only way you ref refinance it is by creating more and more liquidity in the system but that has to have a vent somewhere and the vent seems to be going into things like gold bullion Bitcoin whatever that's that's what's going on and this is only going to get worse that's the thing it feels like it's going to get a lot worse right and so I'm just conscious of time as well and I could talk about this because this is a very complicated topic but how much worse is it going to get um and I put it in kind of context of I have been reading about I think it's the 18e cycle you know since I think 1800 uh every 18 to 25 years or so you know so there's like Peck a drop a massive one and then a big crash right and it happened like in ah the Great Depression um it happened in 2008 um happened in the 80s is something like that happening in 2028 2029 is this is this like a prediction from your end like I guess I'm asking for how you see it like in the next say five years right because I'm hearing like a lot of things saying oh well are the bull market are between say 2025 and 2028 I it's going to be uh the biggest one and then it's going to be be a crash at the end of that right and I just wonder how this links into liquidity conversations and thinking like that I would love to on maybe it's a big question to end on but I'm just trying to get the right predictions here as well I think I think it's it's an important consideration I mean we we haven't delved into some of the bigger issues out there which are something equally big which is China and how China affects the world economy I gave you a sort of uh some evidence that China is accumulating gold it's trying to get out of the dollar system and I think a lot of these rival countries uh to America or to the West basically don't want to be owning dollars because the dollar is being inflated away ultimately but then look hey so is the Euro so is the Aussie dollar so is the British pound Etc uh because what you've got is a very different Dynamic going on in the west is that populations are aging fast and the productivity of these economies is being challenged now if you roll on to how this what's the end game how does this end are we going to see be seeing a big crash well the answer is that's possible and you tend to get that in situations where inflation goes out of control okay that that could be so hold that for if inflation goes out of control you could you could be seeing a problem the second thing is that most Financial crises if not all Financial crises in the course of the last two or three decades have been refinancing crisis when there's been insufficient liquidity coming forward and you can't roll the debt over and so basically there's a there's a crash of some form a liquid you know a liquification and that could happen but that comes back to whether the central banks are prepared to actually allow liquidity be to be created that's a policy decision and then the third thing is what about the debt accumulation is how fast is debt going to grow now you or I don't know the answer to that question that's in the gift of the politicians and if the politicians keep kicking the can down the road and they start making these promises about more spending as it happens they in many ways don't have any choice because this is mandatory spend mandatory commitments uh Social Security welfare payments all these sort of things for an older generation but the more they do not address the problem the deficits get bigger they don't want to tax right it's actually difficult in a global world to tax because you know if tax rates go up we Shi somewhere else presumably if we can right or we try and hide our work so it's kind of get getting more and more difficult so what you've got is a lot of it is how fast that debt accumulates to an extent depends on the politicians so there are uncertainties my best guess is to How This Ends is it it goes on for longer what you hear a lot of economists say uh is you know these debt levels they keep telling us look these de debt levels you know 200% of G they're unsustainable the fact is they're not unsustainable they are very sustainable and the backdrop basically is is think of what happened to Britain after World War II and what you saw in Britain after World War II was skyrocketing levels of debt okay debt GDP went up to I think 250% of GDP because they had to pay for the welfare state the economy was stuffed after the war all these sorts of things now if you start to think of that backdrop what happened to the British economy in the 1950s and 60s okay did it collapse no was it prosperous no but it basically muddled through okay these were the gray years I mean it's still pretty gray in Britain but I mean look hey these were the gray years that uh the economy suffered so what you're going to get is that same sort of you know wet blanket thrown over the Western economies and that's not a great environment to live in so is the inevitable crash that I mean has to come at some point like is that a way that the global liquidity kind of resets UHS all the asset values come down you know everyone okay the problem you're getting is that what's causing the crash is you might get interest rates being hyped up okay but what I'm saying is there's a difficulty there because the more that government's hike interest rates or central banks hike interest rates the more they shoot themselves in the foot here because basically what you've got is a Skyrock Andy interest Bill and that that's really the problem and so it seems that the world is in a very complicated place and it seems that there are things that the average person can do in terms of protecting themselves against future inflationary uh challenges or economic issues and we spoke about that with gold and Bitcoin and kind of certain asset classes where does the bricks thing kind of fit into this whole thing right because we're talking about the West it feels like well there's a there's a lot of what's the word conversations that are the West is falling and because of like the prosperity of the West and all that type of thing right first of all is that is that something that is happening and is that because of the growth of kind of the bricks and how their kind of system I is based on a different kind of economy the yeah I mean I mean the answer is a lot of these problems go back to the rise of China uh the fall of the Berlin Wall these were sort of you know huge shifts in the tectonic plates of the world economy and they made a big difference and really as a result of that what you've seen is in many cases the polarity of the world economy or world financial markets have flipped okay so you've had Capital flows moving in different directions you've had world financial markets becoming refinancing Vehicles not new capital raising Vehicles so a lot of things the the whole landscape has changed and what we think about it may have been 20 30 years ago that interest rates were a decent thing to focus on now they're not what you've got to start thinking about are these Global liquidity flows so the answer is yes they've been huge in this in you know the reshaping and what you've got is in terms of the marginal growth in the world economy it seems to be coming out of these brick economies because they're basically earlier stages of their development uh they're seeing if you like technology productivity catch up with the west and what we know from experience is that that tends to fuel uh very very rapid growth so these economies are going to be faster growing uh they are going to they are going to be you know more dominant in the world economy uh it's China that's going to shape the future of commodity markets because it's got such a ver you know voracious appetite for many many things so all these things are really important now the problem that China is China has and this is the the big issue which faces all of us is that basically China to a very large extent is a dollarized economy okay because it's basically exporting huge amounts of of goods and it's getting paid in dollars now what China needs to do is to get off the dollar hook and start using the Chinese Yuan as the main currency now are they going to do that the answer is absolutely at the first chance they get and if you look at policy statements that have come out of the people out of uh you know the out of China out of the poit bureau or whatever they're very very clear that what they want to do is to displace the American dollar as the main currency within the Asian region at least if not generally and that's what they're really trying to do now if you go back and this is where you may say geopolitics conspiracy theories really come in but it's kind of interesting for us to ponder these things go back to what happened in 2016 in 2016 in Shanghai that there was a G20 meeting and what the G20 countries basically agreed on particularly was then the dollar was strong and the Shanghai Accord so to speak was an attempt to stabilize Asian currencies largely around the Chinese Yuan now look back at that period it wasn't very widely publicized but you can read about it on the internet that this happened go back and look at Asian currencies Asian currency crosses During the period from 2016 to early 2022 there was a remarkable stability like you have never seen in history in the Asian currencies they basically flatlined in value terms and that was because governments or central banks were intent on stabilizing their currencies and there was a lot of monetary policy shifts very small tactical moves to keep that there now what happened in February March of 2022 is the Japanese Yen collapsed now hold that thought because that's important the Chinese want a stable Yuan because that helps them to establish the yuan in the greater world it's a store of value America does not want to stable uan because it competes with the dollar so the fall in the Japanese yen in March April 2022 was significant in that regard because what it did is it destabilized the Shanghai cord in fact it ended it finished it it smashed through the Shanghai Accord that fall in the yen in all the years I've been in financial markets I have never seen a currency a major currency fall as fast as the end did markets never do that to currencies only governments do so I think that was a deliberate move to shift the Yen now what is the what is the Yen now you know we're we're flirting I mean we're probably back at about 150 155 against the US dollar uh but it could be going a lot weaker still and that is the stalking horse in my view that is being used against the Chinese Financial system America is trying to get the Yuan to devalue in my view because that helps to destabilize the Chinese system and it puts China on the back foot and it means that the American dollar retains its its long-term advantages and that's really the the you know the key thing now in terms of of that process to think back to what the consensus view was at the beginning of this year almost everyone was saying the yen is a fantastic investment you know the Yen which is then 140 issue against the US dollar it's going to 110 the most widely invested consensus was that the yen is going to be strong what does it proed to be the weakest currency this year and in my view what's going on is there is a deliberate attempt to weaken the Yen against the uan and this is part of the geopolitics that I wrote about in the book Capital Wars which is describing these challenges this book here which oh yeah you got it there we are of course I've got it and and it's a great book um but be prepared to learn a lot can I ask a final point right so for the average person who wants to be across all the across all of the liquidity information across the globe know what's the best way that they can start to just kind of understand what's going on so they can kind of protect themselves or just kind of think ahead on you know just what's happening in the future right because it does seem that liquidity does seem to lead a lot of the events of the global economy right now so what's the best way that somebody can stay across this information I think is maybe people that have been listening may have may have realized there's a lot of wonkish stuff going on here it's kind of difficult you know even for people you know like us which have been sort of versed in this to kind of understand all these all these uh you know currents uh that we're seeing and terminology and financial markets is kind of difficult but what I would do is it look at a number of things I mean maybe two or three different things one is to you know is to monitor things like the price of gold or to monitor things like the Bitcoin price because they're very important uh bellwethers of this whole process if those are going up then you're basically seeing a monetary inflation underway okay and that's what we we're saying this is not a short-term phenomena it's a long longterm one we're at the beginning of the process uh you know we're talking about this process for you know 20 years 30 years into the future this is going on for a long time uh unless it doesn't but then you know I assume that that if it doesn't there's a crisis and you know we all suffer but generally speaking this is the trend that we've got to start thinking about the other thing which goes into that is think about what government deficits are doing in other words how solid are government finances country by country and these are important things to acknowledge because if You' got a government that is willing to spend money furiously is not prepared to tax running big budget deficits then hey there's a problem and also start to focus much more on bigger currencies bigger units rather than The Fringe I mean if you're a small country what hope have you got in a world where savings are scarce where the ability to fund the American system is challenged so if you're a small country and you want to seek international finance good luck there because there's a diminishing pool uh money is becoming or liquid good money is becoming scarce what a topic you are obviously a global leader in this uh topic and I know that um from a number of people I've spoken to um and also you've written the book on it um and you do it like in a different way yeah so how you actually pull the data together is a bit more complex than others if people want to subscribe and get some of the data straight from you uh what's the best way they can do that because you have a newsletter and you have a subscription service and you have some fantastic data um so how do people subscribe I think there are there are three different ways people can uh can sort of use our services I mean one is that uh we have an Institutional service for professional investors uh that's available on our website crossb capital.com uh people can get access to data we've got extensive databases a lot of Quant funds particularly in America use our dat data for their for Running Money uh Etc so we there's that side we produce a narrative research as well which is part of that process trying to understand what's going on and then we have a summary which is a substack which is uh a much sort of condensed form which is under the title of capital Wars and if you want a lot more of the detail uh of of this stuff there's a book as you kindly advertise called Capital Wars which is a palg grade McMillan publication uh and that's available too I'll have all these links um in the show notes this is just the beginning of this topic for me um obviously this is a big big big topic and I do think that it affects our people in ways that they don't see but it affects everyone and the more you understand liquidity at the global level the more the world makes sense actually right because it feels like the world is a very complicated place but it's actually simpler than what you might think I mean I mean this conversation is not a simple conversation but like at kind of the global level it's it's the flow of money across exactly the borders right it's all about money as always it's all about money sadly but there we are well let's leave it there thank you so much for coming on the podcast this has been a fantastic conversation I'm sure this is going to open up a lot of thinking and conversation just for the listeners and I know for me certainly it's certainly helping me to go into Bitcoin more um because it seems to be a a fantastic Resurgence in that in the last six months and I think that the world's going to get into a very interesting place shortly and I think understanding this information is going to be helpful for everyone so thank you so much great pleasure thank you thanks for the discussion thank you\",\n",
