<div><strong>Title:</strong> MercadoLibre: Argentinian e-commerce giant outperforms mega-cap tech<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> >>> all right. welcome back. it's an e-commerce giant whose  stock has been on a tear this  year. no, we're not talking about  amazon, but a company often  compared to it. cnbc's kate rooney joins us now  with more. what are we talking about? >>> scott, it's not amazon, it's me mercado libre, it's been  outperforming mega cap tech up  64% compared to roughly 50% for  amazon, 30% or so for the s&p. wall street has been  overwhelmingly bullish on the  name, roughly 90% of analyst  have is a buy rating. expansion has been a driver of  the optimism. brad gerstner said it was one of his top picks when he was on  with you recently. the $100 billion company  dominates in south america  making up roughly half of online sales. mercado pagos is the other side  of the company, the payment  side. there's still a lot of growth to be found in latam. >> when you look at the  penetration of ecommercial in  latin america it's quite low  compared to the u.s. or asia. when you look at the penetration of financial services in the  region roughly half of the  population is en banced or under banked. it's a tremendous tuned for us. >> amazon and shein have an eye  on motion co-but galperin  continues to believe they can  have a moat. >> you mentioned brad gerstner. let's listen, in fact, to what  he said, because he said it out  at the goldman sachs  communacopia where we were both  sitting where he appeared. let's listen. >> you look at companies like mf ercadolibre, these -- there are  a lot of companies that people  have forgotten about as they  moved in to the mag seven. i think there are going to be a  lot of internet companies that  are benefitted by a.i., not only margin expansion but  re-acceleration at the top where they can acquire customers,  improve their products in a way  that make it easier for  customers to buy, take friction  out of the system. i'm still excited. >> josh, have we forgotten about some of these? i know you like amazon. you own it and love it, all of  that. as gerstner says and as kate  perfectly lays out for us, this  one's the outperformer. >> yeah. i missed this personally. i followed it and never pulled  the trigger. the stock got hammered after the pandemic like every other  e-commerce or payments play, and that was the time if you had  missed it all these years and,  of course, i didn't pull the  trigger. i was probably distracted by  "hand maid's tale" or something. i'm not a buyer. it is now fully discounting the  very bright future this company  probably has, but the next time  it gets crushed, they miss  earnings or something, hopefully i see it because i really do  think this is going to be a  dominant internet company for  the next ten years in that  region. i think there's a bigger story,  a renewed willingness on the  part of u.s. investors to look  overseas. when you look at the argentinian stock market, for example, being up 70% over the last year, when  you look at india being the best performing market in the world,  there are other options outside  of the s&p 500 and this story is a great reminder of that. >> kate, you look at the chart,  it's really been a spring  breakout, right, from the spring until now is where the bulk of  this action has happened. >> it really alliance with the  margins story. if you look at the margin  expansion, it's quite similar to what happened with amazon, this  massive investment cycle,  margins went negative, and now  they've expanded to double  digit. you've seen the stock chart  mirror that and then this  advertising business where  there's a lot of optimism,  again, parallel to amazon where  that's part of the bull case  here in the u.s. you mentioned a.i. and that's  something brad gerstner talked  about, galperin, the founder,  said we're using it. there are a lot of parallels  when you look at the tech thesis here, at least when it comes to  amazon and the north american  story, and what's going on with  mercadolibre. th<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Former Atlanta Fed president: Expect another 6 to 7 rate cuts of 25 basis points<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> i think it's likely we're on a a fairly deliberate and steady 25 basis point cut uh series for the next several meetings if you look at 2025 the um the median in the dot uh dots is i think for about seven total cuts from where we are today that suggests not every meeting next year but but uh uh several meetings next year and i think that's a base case it's always a base case they really don't know because it it truly is meeting by meeting and they will make a decision based on the incoming data but uh as an outlook from today i'd say six or seven more cuts of 25 basis points<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> AI startup Anthropic revenue expected to surge<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> captions, but new numbers is  making the case that this  momentum won't be slowing down  any time soon. deidre bosa is here for "tech  check." what is you say? >> kelly, so i got ahold of a  document that anthropic has  shown outlining gross marngins. a look shows that its top line  is projected to grow more than  1,000% year over year in 2024 to $1 billion. but its gross margin, thinner  than the typical high quality  companies at 38%. that likely has to do with  higher upfront costs and  developing these models like the need for gpus. investors, however, especially  in venture capital, are willing  to look past those lower margin  it is top line is growing at  1,000 plus percent. revenue growth also helps  valuations look more reasonable. the information reported that  anthropic is in talks to raise  another round at a $30 to $40  billion valuation. at the upper end of that range  with a billion dollar in sales,  it would put its multiple  actually lower than it was nine  months ago. similar story for openai, which  is closing in on a round that  would value it at $150 billion. now, that would be less than  doub double, but mow mentum from bot  of those darlings is likely to  help them continue to raise  capital at ever-higher  valuations, especially when the  multiple looks this way. it's sort of a trick like we  have seen from nvidia. now, a look a little deeper into anthropic's numbers, and some of the risks become a little  clearer, as well. third party atis expected to  make up 60% to 75% of total  sales. that refers to the interfaces  that allow external developers  and third parties like amazon's  aws, to build and scale their  own ai applications using  anthropic's models. customers will increasingly  build their own, but a major  question, can the source of this revenue continue to grow at the  same pace? fascinating when you look at the chat bot from anthropic. that makes up about $150 million of projected revenue, versus  more than $650 million for those third party apis. >> i know the top line is  strong, but as i understand it,  i don't know if the company  itself is this close, there's a  cost of 36 cents associated with every query. openai could lose $5 billion  this year. so the revenue is impressive,  but these are expensive to  operate. >> absolutely. i mean, that's the reason why  i'm looking at the stock ems  that throws anthropic's  aggregate gross profit is just  38%. for a high quality stock  company, that's somewhere  between 70% and 85%. but because of those costs are  expensive, and that is why  everyone, the mega caps are,  when i say everyone, the mega  caps are looking at building  their own chips to lower that  cost. you know, there are signs that  they're able to do so, like  google, which rolled out ai  overviews to everyone say it's  not costing them a material  amount of money because they  have more efficient ways to do  it. >> i find that very useful. i use it all the tim<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> DOJ files antitrust lawsuit against Visa, court records show<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> we have a news alert on visa,  whose shares have been under  pressure. kate rooney has the details. >> so the u.s. department of  justice has filed a suit against visa. according to new court records,  the details of the filing are  not clear yet, kelly. we are reaching out to visa, but it comes after it's been widely  reported, at least yesterday,  that this was coming, that the department of justice did plan to sue visa for being an alleged monopoly, having to do with the  debit card business. so shares under pressure, down more than 4% what looks like the official filing, but, again, we do not  have the details quite yet, but  based on some of the reporting,  it appears this is the official  court filing for that doj  lawsuit. >> at least one analysis saying  the timing is interesting wi<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Citi's Drew Pettit on opportunities in nuclear energy<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> he sees fundamentals ahead for  nuclear energy, and clean water. and one of his picks is a  company involved in both. joining us now is drew petit  from citi. drew, nuclear has really been so sexy, dare i say. we were speaking with one of the leading companies about it  yesterday. what is the angle that you're  looking at now for investors to  be aware of? >> to be honest, it's more  blocking and tackling, a lot  less sexy here, back to basics. when we think about green in  general, nuclear included, we  want to see inflections in  growth, because some of these  subthemes aren't these long-term structural plays. they're very cyclical. so nuclear, we're starting to  see more companies that are  posting positive earnings,  positive cash flows, and s startinstart  ing to see sales accelerate. >> it's kind of like the dow of  this movement, if you will, is  eco labs. they do their -- they do what  exactly? >> so this is a stock that's  going to help companies more  efficiently use water. they're going to treat water. they're going to play to both  the use -- the efficient use  side of things, as well as the  sanitation side. so i think this is key, because  it's back to this looks like a  momentum stock, but it's just a  cyclical story that's starting  to inflect from here. >> and so when we look through  other -- the other buy rate in  stocks, we have all these other, like graphic packaging, some of  these are familiar and to some  extent household names. others are under the radar. are you convinced that these can be better returns on investment  than some of the other poster  childs of green energy stocks  that have not worked out well  for investors? >> yeah, i do. before we get into the  fundamental stories, we had all  of these pure plays, especially  in solar, wind, and even clean  tech, blow up post pandemic. it really takes a lot for  investors that got burned to  come back there. there's just no catalyst there. these more cyclical names,  whether they're packaging names, industrial names, they have a  fundamental inflection. and we've had the fed cutting  rates that is going to get  investors to look through to the other side of that inflection. so all of these names, while  they might not yield like  traditional types of names, they do play into a lot of themes  that companies care about right  now. and that's efficient use of  resources, recycling where we  can, and then honestly, to what  investors need, which is  confidence that the fundamentals are going to get better. >> if i were bullish on nuclear, but a little concerned about the best way to play it, we  mentioned eco lab earlier. what are some of the other ways  with the underperformance that  some of these banner stocks have seen? >> some of the nuclear stocks  are probably more volatile. i think that the way to play  nuclear is in a basket type  approach. you will hear people talk about  modular reactors, they'll talk  about utility companies and  miners, but there's some of the  tech related companies and some  of the engineering and  construction companies that  might help this buildout all  play into it. i think you want exposure across the value chain, because it  helps you get liquidity to this  theme and helps you neutralize  some of the rate sensitivity if  you were to just play utilities  in some of the commodity  sensitivity if you just play the minor. so i think nuclear is more of a  basket play at this point. i think water, when we talk  about <br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> we can save lives we are saving lives we can protect our communities we are protecting our communities and we can make this world we share a little bit healthier and a little bit more secure now it is my honor to introduce a powerful advocate for this work someone who spent years building coalitions to deliver on the issues that matter most people president of the united states joe biden thank you all the my fellow leaders from nations around the world thank you for being here makes a big difference a couple years ago a father who i got to meet from a small town here in the united states wrote me a letter about his daughter her name was courtney she was bright and smart she had a laugh that was contagious and wanted to travel the world but in high school she became addicted to pills her father eventually brought her to a treatment facility but his insurance company wouldn't cover the cost they said quote it wasn't a matter of life and death month later courtney died on a fenty overdose she was just 20 years old 20 years old in his letter that he wrote to me he described life without his child he said i quote there is no greater pain there's no greater pain i told him i know what is like and then lost several children myself children there is no greater pain they still live in your heart but there's no greater pain ladies and gentlemen that's why we're here too many people all across our nation have stories like this too many families suffered unbearable pain and unbearable loss opioids are the deadliest drug threat in our history i've been working in drug control for a long long time since the days i was a senator this is the deadliest of all for years too little has been done to beat this threat here at home and around the world in fact before i came to office overdo tests in our country are increasing by more than 30% year-over-year when i became president i made beating o to dem make a central part of the unity agenda something that our entire nation could rally around and has over the last four years we've turned that agenda into action my administration made excuse me made theone a life saving overdose reversal medicine available over the counter you can purchase it over the counter for the first time we invested over $80 billion across 50 states to expand access to addiction treatment and support i should an executive order that cut cartel leaders all from fin our financial system including issuing 300 sanctions and i've deployed hundreds of advanced x-ray machines to stop the threat of pills and powder coming across our border because i want to be clear this is this is a national security threat in july of this year i signed the national security memorandum officially recognize that fact that is a national security calls on every part of our government to do more to stop fentol protect our homeland from this threat but as all of you know this is a global challenge and requires global solutions so we established a tri the trilateral fentol committee canada mex and mexico to stop narcotics crossing our border i reignited counter narcotics cooperation with china to increase law enforcement cooperation to tackle the supply chains of precursor chemicals and pill pressing and i directed my team to build this coalition this global coalition of address synthetic drugs as all of you here know this coalition now has as the secretary of state says 150 nations as part of it result of these efforts or fentol has been seized at our border in the last two years years in the previous 5 years combined in the previous 5 years combined nearly 60,000 lb of f that's enough to kill every single american many times over dozens of major cartel leaders and traffickers are now behind bars i'm proud to announce for the first time in five years overdose dection coming down across america the latest data shows a 10% drop that's the largest increase on record folks this matters these aren't just facts and figures they're families families who don't have to bear the loss of a child parent a spouse families are kept hold but but too many are still dying there's so much more that needs to be done so the message today is very simple we can't let up we cannot let up drug manufacturers and cartels adap their practices develop new chemicals move fast to evade our efforts we have to move faster they continue to explo the global supply chains to expand the networks we've got to cut them off they continue to fuel violence corruption and instability we've got to protect our people and our communities that's why i'm calling on every nation here to commit to our new global coalition pledge to slay out ac all take to see more drugs stop more cartels save more lives i also want to thank the leaders here who are stepping up and launching the new initiatives today to advance coalition efforts all across three key key areas first disrupting supply chain including production and distribution of of eled drug secondly detecting emerging drug test and increasing information sh across all our countries thirdly preventing more deaths by treating more through public health interventions increased access to life saate medications as possible it's about disrupt detect prevent det treat together we're making it clear enough is enough is enough me close to this as leaders we all have one solmn responsibility protect our people from harm together through this coalition i believe we can do just that we can disrupt the ccle inability the dr traffic cre we get our people the care they need and deserve we can save lives but only only if we come together and work together choices are i believe there can be only one answer we can we will and we must so thank you

<div><strong>Title:</strong> KraneShares CIO on China's stimulus boost: This is the monetary policy bazooka<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> pace for its best month since  july of last year. joining us now is my guest. brendan, i appreciate you  joining us. you say this is the bazooka,  because i'm feeling a little  unconvinced. >> it's definitely the monetary  bazooka. numerous interest rates are  being cut in china, a lot of  support for the real estate  sector in terms of mortgage  rebalances, as well as most  importantly, the chinese  government says the stock market is going to stop going down,  that they're sick of the markets declining and are going to  allocate 500 billion rnb to the  stock market. so yeah, we're seeing the  monetary side of the bazooka for sure. >> so many of these measures  were self-inflicted and run  deeper than maybe they want to  admit. is this a message that private  sector business is going to be  more unfettered than what we  have seen in the past couple of  years, technology in particular? >> yeah, i think there's been an admission of a policy error. now we're seeing a pivot to  rectify that. so within this announcement from the pboc, their version of the  s.e.c., as well as one of the  other regulators, talk about  promoting private equity as well as venture capital. so they're trying to move a  super tanker, which has been  some of the negative sentiment. this is a very clear end case  that they're sick and tired of  the stock market going down, and they're doing more to support  the real estate sector, which is geared to the low consumer  confidence we're seeing in china today. >> peter was saying today he was hoping to give a boost to hong  kong stocks that had been sorely lagging. we had seen chinese stocks or  the k-web up 15% this month. how much more might there be  with a chinese, you know, etf or stock market, where should they  go and how much more upside  could there be? >> the securities within k-web  are discounts of -- they're  trading at valuations 2/3 of the u.s. equivalent. so talking about stocks trading  at forward pes of an 8 or 9. so simply on a multiple  expansion of simply doubling of  that, there's always going to be a china discount, but i don't  think it's unreasonable to think these stocks can get to a 2/3  discount to maybe a 1/3  discount, which means i think  there's significant upside. really driven by little to no  exposure from many investors to  this space. mag seven was the most popular  trade in the b of a manager's  survey followed by short china. this shows the underallocation  of the space, which is why you  can pull money off the sidelines back in. >> is it going to be a  meaningful change? for people trying to figure out  do i allocate a portion of the  portfolio to this, i mean, fool  me once, shame on you, fool me  twice shame on me. >> china is only about 2.5% of  the all country world index. for many investors, that number  is probably zero. so why wouldn't you just pick a  small piece of your profits from u.s. tech from japan or india  and put it into cheap china? because of the high beta of the  names like we hold in k-web,  when they move, it goes up --  can really move. we've seen that to the downside. but i think there are some  positives. so i'm not saying put all of  your chips into china tech. i have a disproportionally large position, but no one else  should. why not take a small piece of  those profits of what's done  well and put it into what  hasn't. >> we used to say that about  gold. now gold is flying and china is  all over<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Why a repricing of oil is needed<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> repeating. my next guest says the declining global crude stocks is at odds  of expectations of inventory. rita, william. repriced in which direction? >> thank you. well, i think the prices are  headed in the right direction. demand concerns have been  paramount in terms of getting  prices down. and we share those demand  concerns. china has been weak. today's measures will go a long  way in at least getting the  economy off its worst, right? we have been saying that the  worst is now behind us. but i think what we've been  trying to highlightto everyone  is that demands only one side of the equation. supplies continue to disappoint. libya's supply is offline. u.s. production isn't growing  and inventories are low. so it is hard to justify price  where is they are right now,  just based on those demands  concerns. >> you think prices should be  higher in other words. we look at the good news that  might be for some energy  investors but think if gasoline  prices start to edge higher into the holidays, that could put  pressure on the consumer,s who  confidence this morning was  already falling. is that likely to be the case? >>> i don't think gasoline  prices are high enough, even if  crude prices go back up to $80  is high enough for consumer  confidence. consumers have been struggling  for other reasons in the u.s.,  and the u.s. fed cuts are a sign that the labor market has been  starting to struggle. i mean, we're nowhere close to  $4 gasoline, adjusted for all  the inflation we have seen, is  not high. but definitely not current  prices. i think that's much more media  rhetoric around high gas prices, especially the upcoming  elections, rather than the  reality of making consumer  sentiment weak. >> where do you think oil price  is headed? >> look, i don't think prices  are going to be materially  higher in the near term, because you have so much uncertainty. you have the u.s. elections  coming up, and i don't think  necessarily that people want to  position before that. you've also got a big opec  meeting coming up in december. if inventories stay low, and one of the interesting things going  on in the market right now is  the time structure, which is the shape of the curve, is quite  steeply backward. back in the bday, the flat pric  should have been about $85. in the past by the way, a  similar stimulus that china has  done today, even half of the  size in the past could have  caused a $6 rally in prices over time, not immediately. so all the signs, be it v inventory, the stimulus china  has done, should lead to higher  prices. but having said that, the  chinese economy is much worse  today than in the past. so i'm just giving you context  how in the past markets have  reacted and thus show you how  the sentiment is right now. >> if people suddenly saw it the way you see it, we could get a  meaningful move higher? >> i do think so in the sense  that because positioning is very one-sided. everybody is short, and you can  see that in the data. adding that, to be honest, is my biggest fear of volatility, that you have a couple of events and  prices go up a lot. which nobody wants that  volatility either, right? look, again, like i said, demand is a concern, but we do think  with the fed cuts and with these china moves, demand should be  gradually improving. again, we are only calling  for -- these are very <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Biden speaks at the United Nations General Assembly in New York<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> time, without exception, that  the --  >> i'm sorry. i have to cut you off. we have the president at the  u.n. general assembly.  >> my fellow leaders, today is  the fourth time i've had the  great honor of speaking to this  assembly as president of the  united states. it will be my last. i've seen a remarkable history. i was first elected office in  the united states of america as  a u.s. senator in 1972. i know i look like i'm only 40. i know that. i was 29 years old. back then, we were living  through an inflection point,  moment of tension and  uncertainty. the world was divided by the  cold war. the middle east was headed  toward war. america was at war in vietnam. at that point, the longest war  in america's history. our country was divided and  angry and there were questions  about our staying power and our  future. but even then, i entered public  life not out of despair, but out of optimism. the united states and the world  got through that moment. it wasn't easy or simple without significant setbacks, but we go  on to reduce the threat of  nuclear weapons through arms  control and bring the cold war  itself to an end. israel and egypt went to war but forged historic peace. we entered the war in vietnam. last year in hanoi i was met  with the voietnamese leadership. testament to the resilience of  the human spirit and the  capacity for reconciliation. today, the united states and  vietnam are partners and  friends, and it's proof that  even from the horrors of war,  there's a way forward. things can get better. we should never forget that. i've seen that throughout my  career. in the 1980s i spoke out against apartheid in south africa and  then i watched the regime fall. in the 1990s, i worked to hold  milosevic to account for war  crimes. he was held accountable. at home i wrote the women's act  and the scourge against  civilians of women and girls not only in america, but across the  world as many of you have as  well. we have so much more to do,  especially against rape and  sexual violence as weapons of  war and terror. we were attacked on 9/11 by al  qaeda and osama bin laden and  brought him justice. then i came to the presidency in another moment in crisis and  uncertainty. ib i believed america had to look  forward, new challenges, new  threats, new opportunities were  in front of us. we need to put ourselves in a  position to see the threats, to  deal with the challenges, and to seize the opportunities as well. we need to end the era of war  that began on 9/11. as vice president to president  obama, he asked me to work to  wind down the military  operations in iraq, and we did,  as painful as it was. when i came to office as  president, afghanistan had  replaced vietnam, as america's  longest war. i was determined to end it, and  i did. it was a hard decision but the  right decision. four american presidents have  faced that decision, but i was  determined not to leave it to  the fifth. it was a decision accompanied by tragedy. 13 americans lost their lives  along with hundreds of afghans  in a suicide bomb. i think those lost lives, i  think of them every day. i think of all the 2,461 u.s.  military deaths over a long 20  years of that war. 20,744 american servicemen  wounded in action and i think of their service, their sacrifice  and heroism. i know other countries lost  their own men and women fighting alongside us. we honor their sacrifices as  well. the face of the future, i was  also determined to rebuild my  country's alliances and  partnerships to a level not  previously seen. we did. we did just that from  traditional treaty alliances to  new partnerships like the quad,  the united states, japan,  australia, and india. i know, i know many look at the  world today and see difficulties and react with despair. i do not. i won't. as leaders, we don't have the  luxury. i recognize the challenges from  ukraine to gaza to sudan and  beyond. war, hunger, terrorism,  brutality. record displacement of people,  climate crisis, democracy at  risk, the promise of artificial  intelligence, and its  significant risk. the list goes on. but maybe because all i've seen  and all we have done together  over the decades i have hoped, i know there is a waforward. test test test testest our task  is to make sure the forces  holding us together are stronger than those pulling us apart. that the principles of  partnership we came here each  year to uphold can withstand the challenges. that the center holds once  again. my fellow leaders, i truly  believe we're at another  inflection point in world  history, where the choices we  make today will determine our  future for decades to come. we stand behind the principles  that unite us, we stand firm  against aggression, end the  conflicts raging today, take on  global challenges like climate  change, hunger and disease,  where we plan now for the  opportunities and risks of a  revolutionary new technologies. i want to talk today about each  of these decisions and the  actions in my view we must take. to start each of us in this body made the principles of  commitment in the human charter  to stand up against aggression. when russia invaded ukraine we  could have stood by and merely  protested. vice president harris and i  understood that was an assault  on everything this institution  was supposed to stand for and so my direction to america stepped  into the breach, providing  massive security and economic  and humanitarian assistance. our nato allies, partners, 50  plus nations stood up as well  and most importantly, the  ukrainians people stood up. i asked the people of this  chamber to stand up for them. the good news is, putin's war  has failed, and his -- at his  core aim. he set out to destroy ukraine,  but ukraine is still free. he set out to weaken nato, but  nato is bigger, stronger, more  united than ever before. with two new members. finland and sweden. we cannot let up. the world has another choice to  make. will we sustain our support to  help ukraine win this war and  preserve its freedom or walk  away and let aggression be  renewed and a nation be  destroyed? i know my answer. we cannot grow weary. we cannot look away. and we will not let up on our  support for ukraine, not until  ukraine wins endurable peace  under the u.n. charter. [ applause ] we also need to uphold our  principles as we seek to  responsibly manage the  competition with china, so it  does not veer into conflict. we stand ready to cooperate on  the challenges of the good of  our people and the people  everywhere, the resumed  cooperation with china, stop the flow of deadly synthetic  narcotics. i appreciate the collaboration. it matters to the people of my  country and many others around  the world. matter of conviction the united  states is unabashed pushing back against economic competition  against military coercion of  other nations in the south china sea and maintaining peace and  stability across the taiwan  straits and protecting our most  advanced technologies, so they  cannot be used against us or any of our partners. at the same time we're going to  continue to strengthen our  network of alliances and  partnerships across the  indo-pacific. these partnerships are not  against any nation. they're building blocks for a  free, open, secure and peaceful  indo-pacific. we're also working to bring  greater stability and peace to  the middle east. the world must not flinch from  the horrors of october 7. any country, any country, would  have the right responsibility to ensure that such an attack could never happen again. thousands of armed hamas  terrorists invaded a sovereign  state, slaughtering and  massacring more than 1200  people, including 46 americans  in their homes and at a music  festival. despicable acts of sexual  violence, 250 innocence taken  hostage. i met with the families of those hostages. i've grieved with them. they're going through hell. innocent civilians in gaza are  going through hell. thousands killed including aide  workers. too many family dislocated,  crowding into tents facing a  dire humanitarian situation. they did not ask for this war  that hamas started. i put forward with qatar and  egypt a cease-fire and hostage  deal. it's been endorsed by the u.n.  security council. now is the time for the parties  to finalize its terms, bring the hostages home, and secure  security for israel and gaza  free of hamas' grip, ease the  suffering in gaza and end this  war. october 7th --  [ applause ] october 7 we've also been  determined to prevent a wider  war that engulfs the entire  region. hezbollah, unprovoked, joined  the october 7 attack, launching  rockets at israel. almost a year later, too many on each side of the israeli-lebanon border remain displaced,  full-scale war is not in  anyone's interest, even as the  situation has eggscalated a  diplomatic solution is possible. that's what we're working  tirelessly to achieve. as we look ahead, we must also  great rise of violence against  innocent palestinians on the  west bank and set the conditions for a better future including a  two-state solution where the  world, where israel enjoys  security and peace and full  recognition, and normalized  relations with its neighbors,  palestinians live in security,  dignity and self-determination  in a state of their own. [ applause ] progress towards peace will put  us in a stronger position to  deal with the ongoing threat  posed by iran. together we must deny oxygen to  its terrorist proxies which call for more october 7th and ensure  that iran will never ever obtain a nuclear weapon. gaza is not the only conflict  that deserves outrage. in sudan, a bloody civil war  unleashed one of the world's  worst humanitarian crisis. 8 million, 8 million on the  brink of famine. hundreds of thousands are  already there. atro atrocities in darfur and  elsewhere. the united states has led aid to sudan and with our partners led  diplomatic talks to try to  silence the guns and avert a  wider famine. the world needs to stop arming  the generals, who speak with one voice and tell them stop tearing your country part, stop  blocking aid to the sudanese  people, end this war now. [ applause ] people need more than the  absence of war. they need a chance, a chance to  live in dignity. they need to be protected from  the ravages of climate change,  hunger and disease. our administration has invested  over $150 billion to make  progress and our sustainable  goals. it includes $20 billion for food security, over $50 billion for  global health. we mobilized billions more in  private sector investment and  taken the most ambitious climate action in history. we've moved to rejoin the paris  agreement on day one, and today, my country is finally on track  to cut emissions in half by  2030. on track to honor my pledge to  qua dropble climate financing to developing nation, $11 billion  thus far this year. we've rejoined the world health  organization donating $700  million doses of covid vaccine,  217 countries. we must now move quickly to face mpox outbreak in africa. we're prepared to commit $500  million to help african  countries prevent and respond to mpox and donate 1 million doses  of mpox vehicle now. [ applause ] we call on our partners to match our pledge and make this a  billion dollar commitment to the people of africa. beyond the core necessities of  food and health, the united  states, the g7 and our partners  embarked on an ambitious  initiative to mobilize and  deliver significant finance to  the developing world, we're  working to help countries build  out infrastructure, to clean  energy transition, to the  digital transformation, to lay  new economic foundations for a  prosperous future. it's called the partnership for  global infrastructure  investment. we've already started to see the fruits of this emerge in  southern africa and southeast  asia and in the americas. we have to keep it going. i want to get things done  together in order to do that we  must build a stronger, more  effective and more inclusive  united nations. the u.n. needs to adapt and  bring new voices and new  perspectives. that's why we support reforming  and expanding the membership of  the u.n. security council. [ applause ] our u.n. ambassador just laid  out our detailed vision that  reflects today's world, not  yesterday's. it's time to move forward. the security council like the  u.n. itself needs to go back to  the job of making peace, of  brokering deals to end wars and  suffering. [ applause ] stop the spread of the most  dangerous weapons of stabilizing troubled regions from east  africa to haiti to kenya-led  mission working alongside the  haitian people to turn the tide. but also have a responsibility  to prepare our citizens for the  future. we'll see more technological  change, i argue, in the next two to ten years, than we have in  the last 50 years. artificial intelligence is going to change our ways of life, our  ways of work, and our ways of  war. it could usher in scientific  progress at a pace never seen  before and much of it could make our lives better. but ai also brings profound  risks from deep fakes to  disinformation to pathogens to  bioweapons. we've worked at home and abroad  to define the new norms and  standards. this year, we achieved the first ever general assembly resolution on ai to start developing global rules, global rules of the road. we also announced a declaration  on responsible use of ai joined  by 60 countries in this chamber. but let's be honest, this is  just the tip of the iceberg. what we need to do to manage  this new technology. nothing is certain about how ai  will evolve or how it will be  deployed. no one knows all the answers. my fellow leaders, it's with  humilitity i offer two  questions. first, how do we as an  international community governor ai? as countries and companies race  to uncertain frontiers, we need  an quality urgent effort to  ensure ai's safety, security and trustworthiness. as ai grows more powerful, it  must grow -- also must grow more responsive so our collective  needs and values, benefits of  all must be shared equitably. it should be harnessed to a  narrowed, not deep digital  divides. second, will we ensure that ai  supports, rather than  undermines, the core principles  that human life has value and  all humans deserve dignity? we must make certain that the  awesome capabilities of ai will  be used to uplift and empower  everyday people. not to give dictators more  powerful shackles on the human  spirit. in the years ahead, they may  well be no greater test much our leadership than how we deal with ai. let me close with this. even as we navigate so much  change, one thing must not  change. we must never forget who we're  here to represent. we the people. these are the first words of our constitution. the very idea of america. they inspired the opening words  of the u.n. charter. i made the preservation of  democracy the central cause of  my presidency. this summer, i faced a decision  whether to seek a second term as president. it was a difficult decision. being president has been the  honor of my life. so much more i want to get done. as much as i love the job, i  love my country more. i decided after 50 years of  public service it's time for a  new generation of leadership to  take my nation forward. my fellow leaders, let us never  forget, some things are more  important than staying in power. it's your people. [ applause ] it's your people that matter the most. never forget, we are here to  serve the people. not the other way around. because the future will be won  by those who unleash the full  potential of their people, to  breathe free, to think freely,  innovate, to educate, to live  and love openly without fear. that's the soul of democracy. it does not belong to any one  country. i've seen it all around the  world. the brave men and women who  ended apartheid, brought down  the berlin wall, fight today for freedom and justice and dignity. we saw it, that universal  yearning for rights and freedom  in venezuela, for millions cast  their vote for challenge, hadn't been recognized, but it can't be denied. the world knows the truth. we saw it in uganda, lbgt  activists demanding safety and  recognition of their common  humanity. we see it in citizens across the world peacefully choosing their  future from ghana to india, to  south korea, nations  representing one quarter of  humanity that will hold  elections this year alone. it's remarkable the power of "we the people" that makes me more  optimistic about the future than i've ever been. since i was first elected to the united states senate in 1972,  every age faces challenges. i saw it as a young man, i see  it today. but we are stronger than we  think. we're stronger together than  alone. and what the people call  "impossible" is just an  illusion. nelson mandela taught us and i  quote "it always seems  impossible until it's done." "it always seems impossible  until it's done." my fellow leaders, there's  nothing that's rey<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Squawk Pod: Investor John Paulson & a 200% tariff threat - 09/24/24 | Audio Only<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> bring in show music please hi i'm cnbc producer katie kramer today on pot a rare interview with billionaire investor john pson he's a key surrogate and fundraiser for donald trump's campaign the former president has threatened a 200% tariff on john deere if the company offshores but paulson says trump's tariffs are good strategy what trump wants to do is create an american manufacturing powerhouse and using tariffs as a way to level the playing field how he sees the two candidates for president measure up one's more risky than the other do you not see it that way absolutely not you know i i'll go back to repeating we've had four years under trump it was a very lowrisk environment and paulson responds to concerns about the former president's character i would disagree on how other people view him i think he'd be a great president and he'd be a great president for all americans that lively conversation and all the rest of today's news that got us squawking it's tuesday september 24th squawk pod begins right now stand becky by in three 2 1 c please good morning everybody and welcome to squawkbox right here on cnbc we're live from the nasdaq market site in time square i'm becky quick along with joe kernin and andrew ross sorin and there was some news from china overnight the central bank governor holding a rare news conference announcing plans to cut the amount of cash the banks need to have on hand by 50 basis points the central bank governor didn't say when the new policy would take effect but he did say that it would be in the near term banks also cutting the 7-day repo rate by 20 basis points that's double the cut that economist had been expecting china's 10-year government bond yield had a record low of 2% during the speech but the stock markets there took off um very big moves there's been expectation that the central bank would do a more aggressive move market's been waiting for it this may be a little sooner than expected and the expectation at this point is that you could actually see uh trying to get much closer to that 5% roughly 5% growth that they'd been hoping for as a result you saw markets up sharply the shanghai composite up by more than 4% and in hong kong stocks were up sharply as well i think it was also a gain of more than 4% what what do mortgage rates p on the 10 year right and and the fed can't control the tenure but we've been moving up the steadily ever since they the half a point cut it just shows you they don't really have control no of the long end but part of the rationale is to make housing more affordable with lower mortgage rates we'll see it's it's still early but uh we're closer to four than we were than we are to 3 and a half 3% after the the cut and here's the 30-year fix 6.2% i think is what we were just showing i'm not sure what it mean i'm not sure it means that the bond market is still wary about inflation we had somebody who was trying to explain to us the other day that this wen't you still wory about inflation yeah i definitely especially when you hear some of the news that andrew is going to talk about right now too let's uh do that right now boeing uh sweetening its contract offer to more than 30,000 striking uh machinists saying it's the best and final proposal the labor union criticizing the offer saying boeing didn't negotiate it and called it an attempt to bypass the union deal would boost general wages by 30% over 4 years that's up from a previously proposed 25% and also doubled the ratification bonus to $6,000 reinstating an annual machinist bonus and raising the company's 401k match now boeing said the offer is contingent upon ratification by 11:59 p.m. on friday the union said that time frame doesn't give it enough time to present details to members it also said the company has refuse to meet for further discussions and it will not hold a vote on friday the union will however they say survey members about boeing's new offer and i think what you're suggesting is this will turn out to be inflationary yeah i but i look i i i think it's not just boeing there there are strikes that are taking place all over uh the ports potentially doing it there was another um airline uh facility that saw the manufacturing facility that saw a strike yesterday i i with with boeing i don't know if they could be more ham handled about how they're handling this what's with the you know we pulling this off this is our last and if you don't do it by friday it's off the table and you're back to where we were just why because it seems like they're offering like when you're in contract ne it doesn't matter what they're offering at that point you're like up oh no if i don't decide if i don't you know fold by then then we're back to you know any gains that we may have made we're back back to s you haven't heard anything about managing maybe that's maybe that's the way you do labor negotiations so i don't look i understand them not having a lot of a lot of un leadership i understand that entirely because the last one that they that they passed on their membership got 4% of the membership to actually vote in favor of 96% voting against i get that but what in the world is that like it's gone from 0er to 150 like instantaneously from like he yeah let's talk about this to okay take it or leave it you're on your own you don't hear of them sitting down with anybody and trying to hammer this out this might be inflationary too and it also i don't know it's not very republican i don't think former president trump threatened tractor maker john deere with a 200% tariff if it moves production of factories in mexico is in response to a question about deer's recent announcement that it would shift production of some of its models to mexico john deere is going to and anybody else that does this because it's hurting our farmers it's hurting our manufacturing and if you do that you going to have a 200% tariff put on the product that you make in mexico right across the border they think they're going to make product cheaper in mexico and then sell it in for the same price as they did before make a lot of money by getting rid of our labor and our jobs sounds like industrial policy uh once again a deer spokesperson referred cnbc to a section of the company's website which is titled uh john deere's commitment to us manufacturing and on that page it says the in deer's words in order to position our us factories to undertake uh these highly value additive activities it's sometimes necessary to move less complex operations such as cab assembly uh to other locations and u you know there's been chapters written and nobel prizes awarded for um comparative advantage b and it has well this br back to the question is it a free market is it not in many cases in many cases we've outsourced a lot of jobs and a lot of times it increases profitability because labor is much cheaper in other parts you might be closer to the raw materials you're using i dare pointed out that they have spent a couple of billion dollars over the last couple of years um investing in plants in the united states and it is possible that the low tech i mean think about even chips we're not going to make all the commodity chips here in this uh in this country there's there's i don't know are we going to make sneakers those maybe those gold trumps sneakers but are we going to if it's much where are the gold trump sneakers made by the i don't know that's a good i don't know whether they're made in the nike sweat shops over in in the the far eastern or not at this point i i'm just reading a little more about it deer's production moves have been a flasho for discontent among employees though as the company has aggressively shed expenses amid a weakening us farm economy they've trimmed about 2,000 hourly workers or about 15% do something like this here and then then something somewhere else something happens it's not great and it just it's just i don't know it it it's like so many policies that democrats have that sound great on the face and then you connect the dots to the unintended consequences and a lot of times like autos do you want the we have a lot of automobiles in are made in mexico yeah we do it's called comparative advantage and there's times when it makes sense for a company to do something al there have been changes where chinese manufacturers are making things in mexico and then flooding them in and that could put the big three out of business and the new uh the populace republican 2.0 um mindset is that we're protecting american jobs at all costs and if it if it does cost a little more we're still going to do it to keep the manufacturer and and you could say that i mean the whole jd vance hillbilly elogy there is a huge swath of this country that feels left behind because of globalization those jobs really coming to the us i that's what i'm saying it it looks good feels good hey 200% better make it here you know illinois is going to be you know rocking and rolling again but then something else happens right typically and all of it is inflationary yeah i don't you know great piece here about what screwed up our our manufacturing all those subsidies i mean half of i mean the whole ev market compared to when the ira was passed it's like a totally different demand profile now in terms of timing and everything else and a lot of those things probably weren't very economically smart the the way that we're doing it it's not paying off so trump's going to speak today by the way the former president in savannah georgia he's expected to make a pitch to foreign companies on why they should move their manufacturing operations in the united states big uh port uh city down there in savannah huge a senior trump adviser tells us that he's going to highlight a 15% corporate tax uh for those making products in the us lower energy costs after u some regulatory uh i guess easing some some of the regulatory burden access to federal lands if needed and strong port infrastructure uh that's the carrot the stick he's going to threaten companies uh who don't make products here with tariffs when they bring the products in uh to the us so this is all um this is background on on what's going to come out of the actual speech today in savannah talked to john paulson some of this he may had some input and he might have some thoughts just more broadly even about the john deere of it all he wrote a he's defended the yeah in the journal last week total defense of of this type of industrial tariff policy in his words though when he describes it he i think describes it more as a negotiation tactic too but we'll hear a little bit more about it te will be next coming up on squawk pod a rare interview with billy investor and donald trump fundraiser john pson he lets us in on the economics of a second trump term and responds to push back that policy aside it's about who the candidates are this is not a race about character this is not a race about a personality trump you know when he was president we had strong growth we had low inflation real wages grew and we had peace around the world an extended lively interview is right after this we're back this is squawk pod from cnbc john paulson is a billionaire hedge funer a wall street legend who famously made a shrewd move in the days leading up to the global financial crisis more than 15 years ago remember the term mortgage-backed securities a hot and maybe not that solvent housing market drove enthusiasm exuberance even over the funds slashing around an americans drive to own homes the instrument backed by mortgages were sliced and diced and reinvested many times and really vulnerable if anything happened to stop or slow people from being able to pay off the values of their homes paulson saw this risk in 2006 he bet against mortgage-backed securities by investing in credit default swaps a contract that a seller of a financial instrument will compensate a buyer in the event of a debt default when the housing bubble stretched and squeezed and stretched some more more and eventually burst the value of carlson's credit default swaps soared he made an amazing trade carson's fund reaped the benefit and he personally made about $4 billion and now john pson is a fundraiser and surrogate for the campaign of former president donald trump he hosted a palm beach event earlier this year that made about 50 million for the trump 2024 efforts and has brought john paulson out of his shell so to speak the investor has long passed on media interviews he was not really on tv in fact his appearance today on our tv broadcast was his first squawkbox interview ever you don't want to miss a moment andrew ross sorin takes things from here we're thrilled to have you on the broadcast this morning thanks for joining us john hey good morning glad to be here uh there's about a million things to talk about including the markets and the fed but i want to start with this election and i actually want to start with a headline that was made just yesterday uh by former president trump because i think we're all trying to understand uh his plans as they relate to tariffs i'm sure you saw that one of the things that he said was that he plans to put a 200% tariff on uh john deere tractors if in fact they were to move them uh and manufacture them in mexico as opposed to here in the us obviously he has a broader plan around tariffs as well what do you make around about this tariff plan a lot of economists have questioned uh the the the level of tariffs that he would put on i would also say other business executives have and i would say just yesterday mark cuban in reaction to all this said that he thought the plan was insane and a good way to destroy a legendary american company so as an investor and somebody who's on uh trump's side what do you think of this yeah i think i think trump's uh tariff plans are well founded when you look at the economists they they' like the concept of free trade but we don't live in a free trade trade world uh us has minimal barriers to import into the us but we face substantial uh both financial tariff and non-tariff barriers when we try and export so as as a result in 2022 we a $1.2 trillion merchandise trade deficit we've lost thousands of factories millions of jobs to foreigners because of the unfair trade uh competition so so what trump wants to do is create an american manufacturing powerhouse um and using tariffs as a way to level the plane field so in the case of deer we we've seen we now have a merchandise trade deficit of 150 billion with mexico many us factories are closing us plants relocating to mexico taking advantage of the cheap labor and then importing the goods duty-free back in the us what does that do for america uh so by uh putting uh tariff using tariffs strategically we can strengthen american manufacturing and increase real wages for american workers so but what do you think of deer's for example uh comment last night which was to point people to the idea that there are certain types of uh manufacturing that they believe uh may even have lower value if you will lower value ad and that they want to move up the the chain they want that to happen in the united states they believe that the other manufacturing should happen elsewhere and that it would hurt ultimately the company if they weren't able to do it this way well when you look at overall the policies what you see is a hollowed out american manufacturing base and we need to protect american jobs and protect american manufacturing so the policies we we have now are not leading to that outcome we can't have americans american producers close at american factories and offshoring uh july had another record merchandise trade deficit so trump's plan is to bring jobs back to america bring manufacturing back to america uh create incentives to produce in america and that will result in more jobs and higher wages for americans and you don't think it turns into a tariff war i ask because we've had gotten emails from viewers uh some farmers in in the midwest who've said look what they worry about is actually that other countries are going to say well we we don't want your exports or we're going to tariff your exports and so that it creates this a sort of a race either to the bottom or to the top in terms of cost yeah that's the problem we have now they've put in tariffs and non-tariff barriers for us and we've done nothing about it so it's it's a one-way street and we have to make it a two-way street and we have to protect american manufacturers the same way foreigners are protecting their domestic markets we've also talked a lot about taxes uh on this broadcast uh including uh not taxing tips and it's uh we've had a number of interesting conversations with with with folks around the table and i'm curious where you land on that and and one of the things that people say is you know what about a teacher or a nurse or somebody who is is not paid an extraordinary amount of money uh but does not get their pay in the form of tips and yet a waiter or taxi driver or somebody else who would be getting uh their their income in the form of tips maybe the exact same amount of money uh would not be taxed in the same way yeah i think the the trump overall tax plan is to extend the very successful tax cuts he implemented in 2017 and to make them permanent and his tax policy reduced taxes for all americans and he he wants to continue with that policy the proposals that he made today protect those that that are having the most trouble uh meeting expenses in the economy and his proposals allow the american workers to keep more of their uh hard-earned uh earnings give an example under trump real wages grew 7.7% under biden they've declined 2.1% so the american workers is the most vulnerable so the tax policies he articulated no tax on tip no tax on overtime no tax on social security they benefit the people that need the help the most to restore their income so they can meet the higher cost of living today john what do you think of just uh the larger issue of debt and deficits and what some people are describing as a campaign on both sides by the way uh that is a great giveaway that you know every week we hear about a new plan to cut taxes uh or things of that nature but there doesn't seem to be on the other side of it a plan to pay for it all yeah i think i think when you look at the record the truck the trump record has been very responsible under under his administration we only had 1.9% inflation under biden it's been 5.7% the deficit under biden now is 2 trillion so i i think the trump plan does have a a a an effort to bring down the deficit bring down inflation and bring down uh interest rates and i'll give you two examples one is to reduce spending and he's been very clear he wants to eliminate the green new deal and economists estimate that will cost 1.2 trillion in spending as as it's implemented over future years he also has been clear he doesn't want to give any tax federal tax tax benefits to illegal immigrants that will also save money and lastly we can't forget elon musk he's probably the most brilliant businessman in america he's agreed to head an energy efficient commission to bring down the cost of government so those are three ways to bring down spending on the revenue side if we had an average just an average 15% tariff strategically a place that would produce on our three trillion of merchandise imports about 450 billion in annual uh revenue and on the other side if we have higher growth that will also lead to more revenue john two pieces one is the green new deal as far as i understand never passed in a meaningful way so i i don't you're talking about the ir i think you're talking about what they renamed as the which with without a hint of irony john they renamed it the inflation reduction act is that is that which one you're talking about or i mean she did president did co-sponsor the bigger green new deal but i don't i don't know that that's not follow as it relates to the tariffs because you talked about strategically using the tariffs at least our understanding of it in a lot of the way these tariff uh proposals have been quote unquote scored by economists is a broad uh tariff plan not necessarily one that looks at an industry by industry or even item by item and i think one of the reasons people say well that's it could be a tax on the american public is there are industries unfortunately which we the american public are not in manufacturing yet and so the question is yes it would be great to induce more folks to manufacture here but the time it may take to actually get that to work in a meaningful way is going to have at least a short-term cost if not a longer term cost right yes uh so i think the cut the the 10% is an average tariff tariffs will be allocated strategically first industries that are essential for our american industrial base and for a defense industry we can't buy critical uh minerals and from from potential adversaries second we have to level the plane field in industries that we haven't had fair competition and using tariffs will restore uh a level plane field well yesterday he leveled it at john deere too i mean that was are we going to see one offs you're talking about orderly form yeah that would be that would be targeted we want to keep american companies manufacturing in the us and if they're going to close us factories to relocate abroad particularly in mexico take advantage of their cheap labor fire american workers uh that's not a policy that that trump wants to support but it seems like it makes a lot of sense john some of it could be inflationary if it was you know not uh done carefully the the other thing that that we have so much disagreement on just in the the economic uh literature is who pays tariffs and and when that criticism is is levied that it's the american consumer not china or somebody else that's going to pay the $450 billion and it's going to be through higher prices and that's going to cause inflation how do you counter that and it's an effective argument they use they just roll their there's an entire group of economists and and voters who roll their eyes when they think that you can tax other countries instead of just taxing american consumers with tariffs yeah i i would roll the eyes the other way when you look at what's happening china's growing maybe three times as fast as we are uh they're gaining jobs their econom is growing while our economy is is stuck in in stagnation and we're losing jobs so the the the the the the our trade policy has not benefited american workers john i have a different question which is you know some people who are watching this broadcast are looking at the policies of former president trump and they're comparing them on paper to the policies of of vice president harris um but then there's this other question that looms over both of those pieces of paper if you will and some people say you shouldn't even look at the policies themselves you should look at the person and you should look at the character of that person i i want to read you this is barry diller who i i'm sure you know uh is on the other side of you on this as it relates to his view of donald trump but he actually commented uh directly on an interview that you gave uh and he said he meaning you went on sensibly for 25 minutes what he never did was talk about the character the person not a word about that not even well he says a lot of crazy things but he doesn't act crazy what he actually did and what these others do is they refuse to talk about the character of the person that and distance their talk from this person's policies and justify just on policies not on the character of what is arguably a rotten person what do you think of that well you know i don't agree agree with that but this is not a race about uh character this is not a race about a personality uh trump you know when he was president we had strong growth we had low inflation real wages grew and we had peace around the world so i think he's proven to be a very effective leader uh and uh i would look at his record and his policies in terms of you know choosing the candidate but in terms of the character i mean you can go back and look at the the la long list of people who worked with him who no longer uh will vote for him who have called him called him all sorts of nasty names including people uh very high up uh you know that have defended this country i'm just curious how you think about that how you think about the the january 6th piece of this because there are ceos right now who are even planning for what the aftermath of this election looks like not just for their businesses but actually thinking to themselves you know what happens if if if a harris uh wins and and and foreign president trump says that it's not a real win and and uh the sort of angst and and and craziness that could ensue yeah i don't think anyone should have angs they can look at the the per he's already been president for four years so we have a very good uh track record of what his presidency would look like i think if president trump is elected and we implement his policies we'll have an economic boom we'll have a rebirth of american industrialization will have peace around the world and a much stronger economy which everybody benefits so you don't see i a ceo said to me yesterday uh uh forign president trump is quote high beta versus low low beta he uh and basically his argument was that if you look at president trump he said look it could end up and be very very good on one end or could be absolutely horrific uh and the end of democracy on the other and this person said with harris it might be good to okay or it might be marginally bad to okay but that those are two sort of distinctive things he said one's more risky than the other do you not see it that way absolutely not we we you know i i'll go back to repeating we've had four years under trump it was a very lowrisk environment we had economic growth rising real wages low inflation and peace around the world we've had almost the opposite of that uh under the biden harris administration in terms of democracy it's it's the it's the republicans that are asking for voter integrity they they want free and fair elections so i i think democracy will be very safe under the trump what you say what do you say then even about the comments that vice president uh pence made at the time or has made since talking about democracy talking about the the idea that the the former president wanted to have him hung for example or didn't want to uh certify the election yeah i can't comment on uh i'm not familiar with vice president uh pence's comments the john that one thing i don't know one thing i might answer if i went back and literally looked at 10 former positions of of vice president harris it absolutely curls your tongue now or curls your toes now you can say that she's evolved or something but it between getting rid of viice making it not a crimal a criminal offense to cross the border and stay in the united states without papers to uh abolishing ice completely defunding the i mean just go through the list john if you want to talk about a possible horrific future you got four years of trump you know exactly what happened and then you've got her on record saying all these things that no longer apparently matter since she became the replacement to joe biden so i mean i it wouldn't be hard for me to bring up you know what happened on january 6 he said fight but make it peaceful do not do it you know now the narrative is that i i i think vice president pence will disagree with you okay how vice president pence how about mat would you brought up mark cuban and barry diller do you think that that no i'm bringing up names of people who worked for bring john 30 people john scott i'll bring up john paulson and jay clayton and gary con and and and and dozens other you can't cherry-pick lifetime democrats that do not that have tds to make your point on i guess is the window ended i don't think john cut it off cu it stopped right john's like i'm getting the hell out of here no i think the window probably 55 it's for something like 30 or 40 people who have said things and there others that work for him directly worked for him will not for not v for him you're just tds at them out yes it is we understand there are people like that there's also half the country that has litigated what you're saying and doesn't agree right and then there's half the country that doesn't and so if you're going to have a supporter on you want to ask these questions to try to understand where they come down on why they think what they think about them because there's a whole group of people in this country who look at this and don't understand it and so part of what i by the way am trying to do is i want to understand why people think what they think you i you've made that clear with with when we have someone who supports trump i understand that the character issue always the you as how can as a human being how also think as we talked to to say as a human being how can you vote for trump but i also think discuss with senator coons why does he think what he thinks should we have more details about some of these plans do we understand these things in the way we should if voters are going to the ballot box effectively even today through the mail to come back to the character issues again and again again we've had presidents that may not be the perfect character we've had bill clinton for for two terms we've had go through we've had there's a but then there's a question but a lot of a lot of it is a mainstream media narrative that you that you will put forth as factual like if you were a board of directors the question is would you hire this person you got plenty of board of directors that are on probably more corporate types secretly would rather have trump because of his policies and i think we're going to find out about that and that's interesting and we should see and talk to more ceos who who think that and whether they'll say that publicly it's very interesting why wouldn't they say that publicly by the way that's actually very interesting because if they if they actually believed it and they and they thought this was a good a person of good character they should be they' got companies with because they're like michael jordan that republicans buy sneakers of course they do but you don't want to take half you don't want to take okay let's let's get back to john john uh welcome back you stay okay comments well i heard your conversation i think this is about you know coming back to american cor valette values you know we want to protect our border we want safe streets we want american manufacturing powerhouse we want energy low energy costs we want low utility costs we want growth and prosperity for all americans and i think trump has that plan it's a common sense plan it's relatively simple but if given the opportunity to implement i think all americans will be much better off but you're you're ignoring the whole you you heard the other side the character the t i i mean tds is just a shortterm word for what it is but but it's a real thing it's a real thing let me go back to car let me go back to car trump cares about the average american he shows up at funerals when when people are killed he he's he's a he's a he's a warm uh he's humorous but above all he cares about america and americans and that resonates with a lot of people so i i i would disagree on his uh you know on how other people view him i think he'd be a great president and he'd be a great president for all americans hey john we only have 30 seconds but i have one big market question as an investor obviously we just had this interest rate cut there's expected uh more cuts where are you on equities right now in terms of just how you're thinking about this marketplace you know as i said before it very much depends on the outcome of the election uh if if harris is elected and she increases corporate taxes increases the marginal tax rate increases capital g gains taxes and god forbid put taxes uh unrealized gains i i would be very negative on the outlook for equities if trump's elected i think all systems go we' have a very surprised then it just where the equity markets are right now then um not necessarily but i i think there's a lot of uh of fluff and if if something comes to a change the tax policy policy or the direction of the economy i think the markets would be vulnerable john uh we we're uh we very much appreciate your time this morning uh we uh look forward to talking you again i hope very very soon and uh thank you very much and we'll talk to you again you're listening to squawk poot up and

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Calls of the Day: Starbucks, Uber, Lowe's, Walmart, Casey's General Store, AT&T and Charles Schwab<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> >>> all right. let's start with starbucks. thinking about costco still. starbucks downgraded to  underperform from hold at  jefferies, 76 from 80. they say the ceo will be  challenged by, use like culture, value, perception and tech  fixes. you own the stock. >> we initiated it with a decent position in our value portfolio  may 1. that was around $75. i still think there's some room  to play there. i think there's too many haters  in the stock. we need to give brian some time  to get the operations going in  the right direction, which we  think he will. >> uber reinstated strong buy. price target to 90 from 41. this blew way past their target, josh. >> yeah, they've been very  incorrectly coy about the  potential, and now they're  waking up. i still think the stock goes to  100. at a minimum it's 34 forward p/e with 110% earnings per share  growth expected next year. it is almost criminally  misunderstood, probably because  the folks who cover it don't  cover the big tech platform. it's like automotive analysts. this is going to be a massive  platform. it's trading 10% above its 50  day, 10% above the 200 day. rsi is 64, so not overbought. today the stock is up 3%. the 12th best performer in the  s&p 500. i think the big picture that  people are going to come around  to is that waymo is going to be  a source of growth, not a  competitor. uber is going to be the demand  aggregator in the automotive  taxi space. waymo will need uber more than  uber needs waymo. mark my words. they will take this higher. >> lowe's target to 305 from  230. >> this is trading at five  multiple points below home depot. a dividend growth machine. we own it in our value. this is a steady eddie, great  management. it speaks to what we talked  about earlier in terms of  consumer discretionary. the stocks do very, very well in that environment. >> is it time to buy walmart,  like truist suggests today? they raise it to buy from hold. they take the price target to 8  the. >> we love walmart and costco. it's one of our core positions. is it time to buy more? we hold it. i don't know if we will continue to buy here but we're going to  hold that stock through this. >> what about casey's general,  jim? $435 is the price target on this one. >> it's a very well-run company. i wouldn't be surprised if  people didn't know what it is. it's a mid-cap stock, gas  station convenience stores. it's very well managed, there's  a lot of things. they're doing great on expanding margins and making key  acquisitions. yes, 25 times forward earnings  may look pricey, but when you  get a good retailer and think  about a tjx and, yes, even  costco out there, these  multiples can be sustained. it's management. that's what the company has. >> what about at&t, belski? top pick at goldman ahead of  their earnings. the target goes up to $25 from  23. >> i think it's a great value  name here especially how the  operating results recently has  been a great performer year to  date. a lot of people betting against  it. back to communication services,  ford a great opportunity to bar  bell it. obviously there's lots of love  in netflix and google, but at&t  provides that bar bell in the  sector. >> schwab gets cut, deutsche  bank, they still like it but  talk about downside risk into  the earnings report. >> i think it's a great stock. it's l<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Winners & Losers: Las Vegas Sands, FMC Corp, Regeneron and Palantir<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> winners and losers as we like to do. take a look at the winners. las vegas sands, fmc corps, keep your eyes on both of those  stocks today, which have been  winners on the session and still are. there's the sands up 6%. losers is where we wanted to  focus, though, because regeneron was downgraded today. you own that. that's been a mover today by  about 6%. what do you think? >> money has been coming out of  health care the last couple of  weeks, but regeneron is our  position with regard to gilead. we still like the growth in that stock. we're going to stick with it. >> balantir sold off about 3.5%, which you own, as well. but there's nothing to be  unhappy about with the run this  thing's been on. >> we've doubled our position a  couple months ago. this is one <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Trade Tracker: Bill Baruch trims Tesla, sells SLB and buys more Exxon Mobil and Kinder Morgan<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> disagree that consumer  discretionary is an area you  need to get out of. >> the teslas of the world and  the energy debate whether it's  too early or not, bill baruch is making moves, the founder of  blue line capital. he joins us on the phone. thanks for calling in. let's go through these. you trimmed tesla, which is now  positive on the year. you trimmed it by about a  quarter of your position. why? >> yes. we've ebbed and flowed with  tesla pretty well this year. we've added to it the last week  of august, talked about it on  the show. and going into this robotaxi  event, october 10, we felt we  would see this rally up. sentiment has been poor around  it. we're starting to see the turn. the thing i like here about  trimming it, we're back up to  250. a lot of resistance 250 to 260. it's gotten too big within our  portfolio. trimming it back a little, now  back to number ten or so. they almost got in the top five. >> all right. so you want to have a debate  about energy here as well? >> absolutely. >> you bought more exxon. you bought more kinder. you sold slb, taking a loss  there, but belski made the  argument that energy is not  going to work right now. you bought more exxon and kinder as i said. why? >> first, slb was really a tax  harvesting loss to that tesla  profit trade. what we're doing is reallocating the moneys to energy and we're  actually 13% weighted in energy  right now. inventories have been very, very tight. in fact, from a positioning  standpoint, manage money and  crude oil futures has hit net  short about a week or so ago, in diesel the last week. the negativity around it, once  it gets here, can bring a bit of a bottom. we like to see this china news  happened overnight tonight after we made the move. we do like seeing that tail  wind. exxon is really cheap. we own pioneer natural resources before this acquisition and we  like the synergies there. exxon has outperformed within  the space and fully integrated. i know brian mentioned the  dividend there is terrific. everybody is talking about a.i., but how power will be a big  thing with a.i. we believe in natural gas and  the movement logistically  getting natural gas in order to  generate power. kinder morgan will be right in  the thick of that. i think ultimately we're going  to see kinder morgan implement  a.i. for its own usage and  pipeline but it will help supp<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Trade Tracker: Jim Lebenthal buys more Adobe and trims Visa<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> breaking out right now from a  bullish tenant. it looks terrific on a chart. >> all right. we're looking at the chart. we'll follow it. thanks. we'll see you soon on the desk. jimmy, you have some moves, too, before we take our first break. you are doubling down, it seems, on adobe, right? >> yeah. >> you bought more in the last  couple of days. >> right. >> including today? >> including today and  yesterday. look, i think it's found bottom  here. it's debatable. the quarter that was reported a  few weeks ago wasn't as bad as  everybody seems to be making it  out. i think most people who analyze  the stock realize there were  orders that were pulled forward  into the prior quarter, orders  that are reasonably expected to  be filled in the first quarter  of 2025, tradingality 26 times  forward multiple for a stock  that, in my opinion, has done a  good job of monetizing a.i., one of the earliest companies to do  so. i'm willing to step into this  with a little bit more capital. at the same time, scott, i'm  trimming visa. i woke up this morning and i was tempted to sell it outright. i decided to trim it. it's been a good performer. this antitrust news -- and i  know there's a long way between  when the doj files a lawsuit and when it's resolved. i know that, but it's just not  something i want to wake up  every morning thinking about  what in kind of my heart i know, which there is a monopolistic  issue with visa, and i don't  know that the doj will prevail  or not, but there's an issue  there i just don't want to have  to deal request every morning  when i see the news feed. >> you sold the stock or trimmed it on the headline this morning? >> i literally trimmed it on the headline, combined with the fact it's at a multiple -- a forward  multiple, at the upper end of  its long-term channel. again, it's done well for me. it's just not the news i want to be digesting every morning and  discussing with you. by the way, i still have a  position. i know you, you know me. if i have a position, doesn't  matter how big it is, if there's bad news, you'll come at me and  i'll be ready to field anything  you hit me. >> we own it. >> thanks for the preample. >> this has been going on for  three years.  >> barf. go on. >> this investigation has been  going on for three years. we still think it's one of the  leaders in the payment system. i like these types. >> look, i think the important  thing here<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Pres. Biden's to UN General Assembly: 'I came to the presidency at a time of crisis and uncertainty'<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> my fellow leaders today is the fourth time i've had the great honor of speaking to this assembly as president of the united states it'll be my last i've seen a remarkable sweep of history i was first elected office in the united states of america as us senator in 1972 now i know i look like i'm only 40 i know that i was 29 years old back then we were living through an inflection point a moment of tension and uncertainty the world was divided by the cold war middle east was headed toward war america was at war in vietnam at that point the longest war in america's history our country is divided and angry and there were questions about our stain power and our future but even then i entered public life not out of despair but out of optimism united states and the world got through that moment wasn't easy or simple without significant setbacks but we go on to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons throughout through arms control and then go on to bring the cold war itself to an end israel and egypt went to war but then forged a historic peace we ended the war in vietnam the last year in inoi i was met with the vietnamese leadership we elevated our partnership to the highest level it's a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the capacity for reconciliation that today the united states and vietnam are partners and friends and it's proof even from the horrors of war there was a way forward things can get better we should never forget that i've seen that throughout my career in the 1980s i spoke out against the partian south africa then i watched the racist regime fall in the 1990s i worked whole mage accountable for war crimes he was held accountable at home i wrote in pastor violence against women act to end the scourge of violence against women and girls not only in america but across the world as many of you have as well but we have so much more to do especially against rape and sexual violence as weapons of war and terror we were attacked on 911 by al-qaeda and osama bin laden we brought him justice then i came to the prescy in another moment in the crisis and uncertainty i believed america had to look forward new challenges new threats new opportunities were in front of us we need to put ourselves in a position to see the threats to deal with the challenges and to seize the opportunities as well we need to end the era of war that began on 911 as vice president to president obama he asked me to work to wind down the military operations in iraq and we did painful as it was when i came to office as president afghanistan to replace vietnam as america's longest war i was determined to end it and i did was a hard decision but the right decision four american presidents had faced that decision but i was determined not to leave it to the fifth was the decision accompanied by tragedy 13 brave americans lost their lives along with hundreds of afghans in a suicide bomb i think those lost lives i think of them every day i think of all the 2,461 us military deaths over a long 20 years of that war 20744 american servicemen's wounded in action i think of their service their sacrifice and their heroism i know other countries lost their own men and women fighting alongside us we honor their sacrifices as well to face the future i was also determined to rebuild my country's alliances and partnerships to a level not previously seen we did we did just that from traditional treaty alliances to new partnerships like the quad with the united states japan australia and india i know i know many look at the world today and see difficulties and react with despair but i do not i won't as leaders we don't have the luxury i recognize the challenges from ukraine to gaza to sudan and beyond war hunger terrorism brutality record displacement of people the climate crisis democracy at risk strange in our societies the promise of artificial intelligence and a significant risk well this goes on but maybe because all i've seen and all we have done together over the decades i have hoped i know there is a way forward in 1919 the irish poet william but described the world and i quote where things fall apart the center cannot hold m anarchy is loosed upon the world end of quote some may say those words describe the world not just in 1919 but in 2024 i see cr a critical distinction in our time the sener has held leaders of people from every region and across the political spectrum have stood together turned the page we turned the page on the worst pandemic in the century we made sure co no longer controls our lives we defended the un charter and ensure the survival of ukraine as a free nation my country made the largest investment in climate clean energy ever anywhere in history there'll always be forces to pull our countries apart and the world apart aggression extremism chaos and cynicism desire to retreat from the world and go alone our task our test is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger and those are pulling us apart that the principles of partnership that we came here each year to uphold can withstand the challenges that the center holds once again my fellow leaders i truly believe we're in another inflection point world history for the choices we make today will determine our future for decades to come will we stand behind the principles of unit us we stand firm against aggression we will we end the conflicts that are raging today we take on global challenges like climate change hunger and disease but we plan now for the opportunities and risk of a revolutionary new technologies<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Senate Democrats target companies with imbalance in executive pay, taxes<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> taking shape. democratic lawmakers are looking for information from the  companies and including the  biggest names in tech and trying to reshape corporate taxes. we have emily wilkins with more  on that story. emily, good morning. >> reporter: good morning,  frank. a group of democratic senators  sending letters today to 35  companies like tesla, netflix  and salesforce. they are worried they are paying the executives more than they  pay in federal income taxes. the companies were required in  the report for policy studies  and americans for tax fairness. they looked at what companies  paid the top five executives and what they paid in federal taxes  between 2018 and 2022. they found a number of  industries, t-mobile and aig and metlife and dte and u.s. steel  and more getting the letter  citing that study and asking how much they plan to spend in  lobbying when provisions expire  next year. the letter from senator  elizabeth warren and five other  democrats offers a view of the  increase in the corporate tax  rate next year as part of the  tax negotiations. this is the 2017 tax law. democratic nominee kamala harris proposes raising to 28% which is the same amount that the  democrats supported in 2022. the lawmakers wrote in the  letter today that, quote, as  congress consider what is to do  when provisions of the 2017 law  expires next year, it is  critical we ensure large,  profitable businesses are paying their fair share. democratic lawmakers aren't the  only ones for a showdown on  corporate taxes, the u.s.  chamber of commerce showed the  ten-year um impact of raising t  taxes. frank. >> emily, you are hitting how  the democrats see corporate  taxes. how do the gop see it? >> reporter: we know former  president trump talked about  continuing to lower the tax  rate. it was in the 30s when he took  office. it went down to 21and now he is  proposing 19%. you heard similar things from  republicans. you heard speaker mike johnson  talking about bringing down the  corporate rate. for the most part, everyone who  i'm talking to on capitol hill  agrees if republicans are in  charge next year, there is a  good chance we could see the  rate go <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Jorgensen testifies before Senate on weight loss drugs pricing — 9/24/24<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> the health education labor and pensions committee will come to order and i want to begin by thanking mr lars jensson the ceo of an nooris uh for being with us today for this important hearing the issue that we are discussing this morning is not complicated it has everything to do with the chart behind me which shows that novon noris diabetes drug oic is sold in canada for $155 in denmark for $122 in france for $71 and in germany for $59 in the united states novais charges us $969 over 15 times more than they sell that product in germany wovi noorus weight loss drug is even more expensive as the chart behind me also shows wovi is sold for $265 in canada $186 in denmark $137 in germany and $92 in the united kingdom in the us the list price for bovi is $1,349 a month nearly 15 times as much as it cost in the united kingdom what we are dealing with today is not just an issue of economics it is not just an issue of corporate greed it is a profound moral issue noo noris has developed gamechanging drugs which if made affordable can save the lives of tens of thousands of americans every year and significantly improve the quality of life of millions more if made affordable if not made affordable americans throughout this country will needlessly die and suffer as representatives of the american people we cannot allow that to happen and let's be clear the outrageously high cost of oic wovi and other prescription drugs is directly related to the broken dysfunctional and cruel health care system in our country while the current system makes huge profits for large drug companies like nova norisk huge profits for insurance companies and huge profits for pbms it is failing the needs of ordinary americans the united states today we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as the people of any other country nearly $13,500 for every man woman and child over 177% of our gdp yet despite this huge and unsustainable expenditure we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as human right further despite all of that spending our healthcare outcomes are not particular good today over 85 million americans are uninsured or underinsured over 60,000 die each year because they don't get to a doctor when they should and our life expectancy which is actually declining in many parts of the country is far below most other wealthy countries so what does all of this have to do with mr jorgenson nova norisk and our hearing today a lot the simple truth is that we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and that is a major factor in the health care crisis we experience how does that happen what's the connection first one out of four americans are unable to afford the prescription drugs that their doctors prescribe insanely that means that millions of americans go without the treatment that their doctors recommend the result some will actually die and others will become much sicker than they should and millions will unnecessarily end up in emergency rooms or hospitals at great expense to our health care system how crazy is that second one of the reasons that hospital costs it's not just prescription drugs hospital costs in this country are rapidly rising has to do with the very high cost of prescription drugs and my hospital in burlington vermont ceo there tells me that 20% of his budget goes to the high cost of prescription drugs and there are treatments now that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year third a significant reason for the high cost of insurance policies if you're upset out there that you're paying very high amounts of money for your insurance has to do to a significant degree with the high cost of prescription drugs drugs yes millions of americans with decent health insurance pay minimal amounts for their prescription drugs that's the good news the bad news is that they are paying a fortune in premiums deductibles and co-payments for the insurance that covers those drugs i should also add that if you're a taxpayer in this country you're paying higher taxes than you should because of the inflated cost of medicare medic medicaid and other public health programs pay for prescription drugs now that is the overview and why the issue that we're discussing today is so important it impacts every aspect of our health care system the federal budget private insurance now let's get to the particulars with regard to nova noris oic and movi oic and movi are different brand names for the same drug semaglutide these drugs are transformative new treatments for diabetes and obesity that help people control their blood sugar and lose weight both are manufactured by nova norisk and both are on track to be some of the bestselling and most profitable drugs in the history of the pharmaceutical industry in fact since 2018 noan noris has made nearly 50 billion dollar in sales off of these two drugs in importantly for members of this committee 70 72% of that revenue comes from sales in the united states of america in other words the united states is novo noce cash cow for oic and movi and given that these drugs will need to be taken over the course of a lifetime it's not a one-time drug you take it for your whole life nova noris can expect to receive tens of billions in sales and huge profits from these drugs year after year after year now why does nova norce charge the american people such outrageously high prices for oic and movi are they acting illegally by charging us some such high prices are they violating the law no they're not what they are doing is perfectly lawful they are simply taking advantage of the fact that until very recently the united states has been the only major country on earth not to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs in other words nova noris and other drug companies not just nova nois can charge us as much as the market can bear and that is precisely what they are doing now in a few minutes mr when mr jorgenson makes his presentation and we look forward to hearing from him i suspect that he will tell us that the health care system here in the united states is complex that there is a difference between the list price and the net price as a result of the rebates that pbms receive and this committee has begun to do some serious work with regard to pbms and if he says that he is correct but even factoring in all of the rebates that pbms receive the net price for oic is still nearly $600 over nine times as much as it cost in germany and the estimated net price of bovi is over $800 nearly four and a half times as much as it cost in denmark what must also be understood is that not everybody can take advantage of the net price of these drugs if you are uninsured you pay the full list price if you have a large deductible you pay the full list price if you have co- insurance the percentage of the price you pay at the pharmacy counter is based on the list price and let's be clear 75% of americans over 190 million people with insurance are unable to access wovi through their insurance policies mr jorgenson may also tell us that nova nis is afraid that if it substantially reduce the list price for zmk and wovi pbms may limit coverage for these drugs well mr yenson let me ease your concerns i am delighted to announce today that i have received commitments in writing from all of the major pbms that if novaa substantially reduced the list price for asempa movi they would not not limit coverage in fact all of them told me they would be able to expand coverage expand coverage for these drugs if the list price was reduced i ask unanimous consent to insert the letters i received from the pbms making this commitment into the record now let me share with the committee some other important information that we have uncovered as part of our investigation last week i received a letter from over 250 doctors urging us to do everything that we can to substantially lower the price of these drugs this should come as no surprise what these doctors are telling us is that if the price of oic and movi is not substantially reduced many of their patients who have diabetes and obesity especially lower income americans an often minority americans will be unable to afford these drugs some of these people some of these patients will unnecessarily die and others will suffer a significant decline in their quality of life i ask unan to consent to enter that letter into the record earlier this year dr allison galvani an epidemiologist at yale university conducted a study on movi and what she found and i hope mr yenson pays attention to this is that over 40,000 lives a year could be saved if a goie were made widely available at an affordable price to americans who need the drug 40,000 lives i ask unanimous consent to insert that study into the record a few months ago dr melissa barber a healthc care economist at yale university conducted a study on the cost the cost of manufacturing oic and what she found is that o can be profitably manufactured for less than $5 a month we all know the cost of production is not the only expense by far for a drug company pharmaceutical companies spend great sums of money on research and development to find new treatments with many of these products not coming to market we all understand that but it is important to know that this drug can be manufactured profitably for a few dollars a month we may hear from mr jorgenson that no that novan not spent $21 billion on research and development since 2018 and i take his word on that what he may not tell you is that novaa spent 44 billion on stock buybacks and dividends over that same time period in other words since oa came on to the market in 2018 noora spent over twice as much on stock buybacks and dividends that it spent on research and development and let's be clear outrage over the high cost of oic and other prescription drugs is not a partisan political issues i expect every person on this committee understands it's not a democratic issue it's not a republican issue i'm an independent not an independent issue the vast majority of the american people are sick and tired of paying outrageously high prices for prescription drugs for example dale fwell the republican treasurer of the state of north carolina has told us that if he did not discontinue covering wovi for some 20,000 state workers in north carolina he would have been forced to double double health insurance premiums for teachers firefighters and police officers in his state regardless of that needed to struger not he would have had to double health insurance premiums in north carolina lross shield of michigan also announced that would have to discontinue covering movi because it was too expensive and when we talk about differing political views i will tell you that elon musk not one of my great political allies recently posted on twitter and i quote solving obesity greatly reduces risk of other diseases especially diabetes and improves quality of life we do need to find a way to make appetite inhibitors available to anyone who wants them end of quote and mr musk is right further not only must we be concerned about lack of access to these drugs we have also got to take a serious look at the financial implications of what happens if the prices of these drugs are not substantially reduced bottom line if just half of the adults in our country with obesity took weight loss drugs like wovi at current prices the cost would be astronomical and would have a devastating financial impact on our country and on federal and state budgets best estimate that i have seen suggests that if half the adults in our country took these weight loss drugs it would cost $411 billion dollar a year 411 billion and that is more than what americans spent on all prescription drugs at the pharmacy counter in 2020 2022 in other words the outrageously high price of these drugs could bankrupt medicare and radically increase premiums to absolutely unaffordable rates this does not have to happen it does not have to happen over the last several months i and my staff have been talking to a number of major generic pharmaceutical companies these are large companies that supply hundreds of millions of prescriptions to many millions of americans and what these ceos have told me is of is of enormous consequence they have studied the matter and they have told me that they can sell a generic version of oic the exact same drug that no nova nisk is manufacturing to americans for less than $100 a month $100 a month nova norus charges us $969 a month pric these generics can sell it to us for less than $0000 let's be clear nobody here is asking noan oras to provide charity to the american people nova nordisk has already made billions of dollars in profit off of these products and in the coming years will make billions more all we are saying mr jensson is treat the american people the same way that you treat people all over the world stop ripping us off a few months ago president biden and i wrote an oped which appeared in usa today and here's what the president and i said quote if nova nois and other pharmaceutical companies refuse the substantially lower prescription drug prices in our country and end their greed we will do everything within our power to end it for them noo noris must substantially reduce the price of oic and wovi as americans we must not rest until every person in our country can afford the prescription drugs they need to lead healthy happy and productive lives end quote from the oped from the president myself that's what president biden and i wrote a few months ago and that's what i believe prescription drugs in this country must be affordable and we must not be forced to pay far higher prices than people in other countries for the same exact product this is especially true when we face a national emergency in terms of the twin epidemics of diabetes and obesity which if not addressed with lower cost drugs could cost us tens of thousands of lives and an unimaginable amount of money congress and the administration have a moral responsibility to act now act boldly and to protect the american people senator cassidy you will now recognize for an opening statement thank you chair sanders nearly one in three americans live with obesity nearly one in 10 have type type 2 diabetes i'm a physician i'm very aware of the implications of that there are so many complications obesity leads to more chronic disease than any other condition taking lives and costing causing almost 173 billion in health care spending a year it's almost impossible to bring down health care cost unless we effectively address obesity now we have gop 1s they have the promise to address both obesity and the complications that result there expensive now we can argue about the net versus the list but they're expensive but let me say without a profit motive without something in return it's unclear that these drugs or any drug is going to be developed there is a tension a tension between the need to incentivize innovation and the ability to afford that innovation and we are here struggling with that balance now if anyone thinks going after big pharma is the silver bullet that if you do that boom healthc care cost or drug costs go down they don't understand what happens with pricing a drug there is no silver bullet but as my friend angus king says there is sil silver buckshot you do a little bit here and a little bit there and it adds up so the drugs become more affordable given that we still have to preserve the profit incentive for the creativity for drug companies to invest in order to develop the drugs that are going to affect that are going to positively affect the the the burden of disease in our society this is a simple example i've used before when i was in medical school one of the most common surgeries was removing a portion of someone's stomach because of peptic gula disease and then a drug called cadine came out tagamet and within six months that surgery was rarely formed tagamet is so simple it's now sold over the counter but it has saved so many people having disabling surgery now that is an example but now we're speaking about alzheimer's and cancer and obesity and the complications from obesity and i think we have to be realistic it is a profit motive that incentivizes creative people with capital to go in and find that cure so as this committee examines the affordability of gops we have to also examine how do we preserve that incentive for the innovation that is the tension how do we preserve because by the way if we stop developing new drugs alzheimer's won't be cured cancer won't be cured and better drugs to address obesity and the complications of the medical medical uh of the metabolic syndrome will not either so back to this hearing there are serious questions that need to be asked what has contributed to the high price of o and movi what are american patients actually paying for these drugs at the pharmacy counter frankly what are germans actually paying they may pay some money at the counter but i suspect that the health plan is also playing something so so what is the true cost relative to the true cost to us by the i'm particularly concerned with folks with health savings accounts because the share is right if there is a list price which is really high and they have a drug benefit tied to their hsa then that begins to drain their hsa and have always been an advocate of how do we make that health savings account more useful but if it's being drained for a high list price it is less useful i'm about that so so what can we do to make sure that americans have access to an affordable cost and at the same time we have adequate incentive so that someone out there with an incurable disease knows that there might be hope along the way i appreciate mr jorgenson for attending the hearing i look forward to your answers now it's important to note that while drug manufacturers play a significant role in determining the cost of a drug the problem is greater it's more complex than the actions of any one industry so we need to make a serious effort to navigate the network of perverse incentives throughout our health care system including taking a substantiative look at health insurance benefit designs price transparency regulatory barriers and the perverse effects of government discount programs have on prices that americans pay at the commercial market this committee has a long history of engaging in real bipartisan efforts to lower the cost of health care last year chair sanders and i worked on the pbm reform act to address misaligned incentives affecting pbms to lower the price patients pay for their prescriptions the committee passed this legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support by the way we need to get this across the finish line and signed into law and this is the kind of bipartisan work needed to tackle the high cost patients face for ge l ps and for all drugs so thanks again for our coming today mr jorgenson i look forward to you explaining how to balance this tension between innovation and affordability and with that i yield thank you senator custody uh we will now turn to our witness panel for the awareness of all senators and the witness ranking member cassidy and i have reached an agreement where we will both have an equal amount of time to ask the witness questions and all other members will have s minutes to ask the witness questions uh our sole witness today is mr ls jorgenson mr jorgenson has been with nova noris since 1991 and was appointed president and ceo of the company in january 2017 mr yenson thank you very much for being with us you may proceed with your testimony chairman sanders ranking member cas sir make the sure the mic is on there it is on maybe i'll move this can you hear me now yeah much better okay chairman sanders ranking member cassidy senators thank you for the opportunity to speak again before the health education labor and pension committee on behalf of nor nordisk last year i was asked to testify about patients living with diabetes and insulin affordability this year i volunteered to appear before the committee on policy solutions for patient living with obesity and the challenges they face navigating the complex us healthcare system i appreciate the opportunity engage here today for decades our public discourse about obesity and to some extent t to diabetes was based on misinformation and blame these conditions were treated as a personal choice a failure or willpower no one was talking about how these are chronic diseases and treatable diseases with the discovery of semaglutide and the development of oic and mobi our collective understanding of these diseases fundamentally changed but this shift was not a foregone conclusion this was a long and winding road it became it began more than 100 years ago when our company was born monos was founded on the mission to not only treat but defeat diabetes to one day find a cure and it was built on the idea that our success must must be measured by looking at more than our financial sustainability but also our societal and environmental sustainability to this day no no maintains its unique ownership structure that protects its mission the noro foundation is among the top three largest foundations in the world rivaling the gates foundation and it serves as our controlling shareholder for over for over a 100 years the foundation has supported initiatives that improve health and sustainability of the planet this ensures that our time and resources are focused on unlocking cures for chronic diseases mr jorgenson can you push pull that microphone a little bit closer to you yes sorry about that is better can you work on a medicine for bad hearing okay you know that will be the next it's not really our expertise but maybe one day this ensures that our time and resources are focused on unlocking cures for chronic diseases not on daily stock fluctuations and our focus on this mission is how oic and we go we came about in the early 1990s nordic scientist dr l knutson then a junior researcher in our labs set out to take a hormone that naturally decays in the body within minutes and to make it l last long enough to become a medicine to combat diabetes it took years before she and her team evolved and solved that puzzle and more than a decade longer to turn the research into into lti of pioneering one daily gil one medicine after this discovery many believed that innovating beyond lorti was at best unnecessary and at worst impossible including most of our competitors however another tenacious team of noo scientist refused to give in in november 2004 these scienes created 12 milligram of semaglutide an even more potent molecule to combat diabetes even after that it was still 14 years more in the making until oic was finally approved and another four years after that until w goi was approved and we didn't stop there in 2017 we launched the largest clin ical trial in the history of the company enrolling more than 177,000 patients across 41 countries we demonstrated semaglutide dramatic reduction in mortality for those suffering from cardiovascular disease and living with obesity and because of our commitment to health discovery we can now say that lotti is the only weekly g1 on the market that is fda approved to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events which is the number one cause of death in america today we also conducting even more clinical trials to understand how semaglutide may affect and treat chronic kidney disease liver disease and alzheimer's disease but we know these discoveries are only effective if if patients can access them so along with disc discovering re revolutionary medicines we have committed to expanding manufacturing capacity it took over 50 years to advance our science and manufacturing capacity for insulin production to meet demand today we can provide ins insin to nearly 30 million patients but patients living with type 2 diabetes and obesity can't wait another 50 years that is why since the beginning of last year we have committed over $30 billion to expand manufacturing capacity to put the $3 billion in perspective this is 20% more than the entire us space program it's also four times the amount that congress has set aside for national electrical vehicle charging network our commitment includes 4 billion in new investments to expand our facility in north carolina on top of the 5 billion we have already invested there creating thousands of construction jobs and manufacturing jobs in the state we spend the we spend these resources because we can't afford not to type two diabetes cost us approximately $413 billion every year and obesity cost the us$ 1.7 trillion and we all know the physical and emotional toll these diseases make you have said that our amazing medicines can't help patients if they can't afford them that is true it is also true that the full value of a syic and wio can only be realized if patients can access them patients need both affordability and access that is why we have for to secure public and private insurance coverage for patients with type 2 diabetes and patients with obesity we pleased to say that oic is covered by 99% of all commercial plans by medicare and by medicaid in 50 states and while woi was only recently approved by the fda in 2021 today it's covered by half of the commercial plans as well as over 20 state medicaid plans the department of veterans veterans affairs and the military the indian health service and for all federate employees and hopefully soon for seniors with that said it is clear that patients too often struggle to navigate the complex us healthcare system it's also clear that no single company alone can solve such v and complicated policy challenges so what i can promise is that no noise will remain engaged and work with this committee on policy solutions to address the structural issues that harm patients and drive up cost and i can also commit that we'll never stop driving chains to defeat serious chronic diseases like obesity and obesity i appreciate the committee's focus on the on insuring patients living with chronic diseases can have affordable access to the medications they need and i look for for to your questions thank you very much thank you very much mr jenson um mr yenson this committee and you and others have talked a lot about list prices you make the point that we have a complicated system and you're certainly right so we talked about list prices we've talked about rebates we've talked about net prices but at the the end of the day under your best case scenario the price you are charging americans for oic is still nearly $600 that's with all of the rebates and all of the discounts that's over nine times as much as people in germany pay for the product and the price you are charging for wovi to americans is over $800 nearly 4 and a half times as much as it cost in denmark so very briefly and number of people going to be asking you questions please tell me why you think it is appropriate to charge americans nine times more for the same exact product that you sell in germany and by the way correct me if i am wrong here but i assume that when you sell oic for $59 a month in germany you are making a profit there am i correct on that so senator let me start by acknowledging and sharing your wish to have affordable medicines for americans and uh there's been a number of uh numbers mentioned here and i think it's it's important to say that these are not comparable uh data um when i mentioned that it's really really important for us to secure access uh to patients and for ability uh we are hard at working making sure that patients have access via the insurance schemes and today uh 80% of all americans with insurance have access to these medicines at $25 or less uh for a month supply so so it's a price point at the pharmacy council we have to talk about let me just interrupt you if i might okay you're correct that many people pay $25 a month for his z but what you're forgetting to mention is that many of those people are paying outrageously high prices for the insurance that covers oic and other drugs so simply this is a pass through to the insurance companies bottom line is you are charging the american people substantially more for the same exact drug than you are charging people in other countries and my question is why so sen senator i appreciate the question let me try to uh explain how i see it um we launched oic in 2018 um we have had it on the market for for some years uh during those years our price has declined by 40% um i mentioned that patients with insur insurance have access uh to to the $25 or less for 80% of the cases and if you look in this period uh in medicare where there's broad courage uh premiums have not gone up in the same period uh the insurance companies and their pbms the big conglomerate of uh uh il legal entities they have have more than doubled actually close to tripled their profit so the fact that we can actually secure that 99% of people with insurance have access that there's a co-pay at the pharmacy of $25 or less without premiums going up in medicare while profit goes up for for the middleman think is concerning data point well i would simply say that most americans would be surprised to learn that insurance rates are not going up in my state they're going up by 14% but once again you are not answering my question it's a very simple question in germany in uh in germany they're paying $59 for oic in the united states we pay $969 and again even with all all of the discounts we are still paying very substantially more than the people of any other country and you are selling as i understand that 72% of your revenue comes from the united states that right roughly if it's based on our accounts uh you're right i don't have the number from so you're selling you're making huge amounts of money in this country and you're charging us far more uh and you haven't given me an answer as to why let me ask you another question uh a recent study from yale university has estimated as i mentioned earlier that 40,000 lives in america could be saved each and every year if nova substantially reduced the price of agoi and made it available to everyone who needs this drug at an affordable price um from a moral perspective does it bother you knowing that keeping the price of oic and movi so high in the united states could lead to the preventable deaths of tens of thousands of americans so senator we are very committed to make sure that americans have access at affordable price point for our medicines there's no thing we would rather see happen we we we have just announced 30 billion investments to increase capacity to serve these patients um there is a market we have to operate in and uh we uh negotiate uh hard to make sure that americans have access we ne negotiate against the ppms and give them significant rebate discounts and fees mr yenson you're not answering the question and i know look as you may know i'm a great respector of the people of denmark uh i think you have a social system which is very progressive but i'm asking you a simple question as a decent human being what studies tell us is that because of the very high price of your products 40,000 people a year may die in america and you have not increased production is fine but what i am asking you is if you don't act 40,000 people a year could die is this acceptable to you senator any prospects of patients not getting access to the medic the need i think is is terrifying uh and we uh have to solve this challenge together i mentioned in my opening that i don't think any one company can solve that alone i wish uh there were more at the table today so we could have a discussion about how we do that together we we don't decide the price for patients um that's said by by the insurance companies i do acknowledge acknowledge that there are patients who have a poor insurance or no insurance and if you in the us do not have insurance if you have a low income we actually have support programs to help those patients i'm proud about those but they they are not a real solution because patients should have access to medicines via insurance because if you live with a chronic disease like type two type two diabetes or obesity these are complex diseases that requires access to physicians there are comorbidities you need to have treatment for uh so it's i strongly believe we need to solve this within insurance and when you are in insurance uh there there is access to our medicine mr you know mr yens this committee has heard from insurance companies we've heard from pbms we've heard from everybody in the world everyone blames everybody else but you still have not answered my question it's a very simple question why nova noris is charging americans substantially higher prices for these drugs than the people in other countries let me get to another issue mr jorgenson you have told this committee that you were concerned that if you substantially lowered the list prices of o movi in the united states pbms may take these drugs off of their formularies and deny access to patients who need these drugs i think he used insulin as an example of that however i have received commitments in writing from the major pbms that if novon norus lowered its price they would not limit access to asmic and movi and would not take these drugs off of their formularies given this fact will you commit today that nova nis will substantially reduce the list price of these drugs in the united states so that the american people are not paying higher prices far higher prices for these drugs from the people in europe and canada so thank you senator for for that uh information that's new information for me uh anything that will help patients get access to affordable medicine we'll be happy to look into i' just like to make a comment uh also that uh the experience as you also allude to yourself from insulin is one of when we uh had a discussion last year in in the in the hearing on insulin we actually lowered uh insulin pricing that had a consequence so when we dropped some of the insing prices uh we had our products dropped from formulary coverage so less patients got access to those insulins so i have a bit of uh concern how this could play out but anything that can help patients get access to the medicines they need at affordable price point we'll be happy to collaborate around that are you prepared to have noa not sit down with the pbms who have made that commitment to me that they will not take your products off of the formulary sit in the room with us and work on an agreement i'll be happy to uh as i said do anything that helps patients and i don't know under which conditions such a promise uh comes i haven't seen any of that okay i will get you the they're in writing and i'll get you the letters um all right that's it for me right now uh senator cassid do you want to i'll defer to i'll defer to senator collins for her seven minutes of questions thank you very very much senator cassidy mr jorgenson you testified that the net price of what your company is actually paid for oic has declined by about 40% since its introduction is that correct yes that's correct but the question remains how do we give relief to patients at the pharmacy counter as senator cassidy has mentioned this committee's examined the role of the middlen the pbms in inflating costs and more than a year ago in may of 2023 our committee reported a comprehensive bill that reformed pbm practices and the whole purpose of that bill was to ensure that consumers got relief at the pharmacy counter unfortunately the senate majority leader and the chairman have not brought that bill to the senate floor in more than a year could you give us some indication of what the impact on cost to consumers would be on prices if we had enacted that pbm reform bill yeah thank you senator for for that question um if we look at it today um pbms and their insurance companies or i think typically insurance companies that owns a pbms and number of legal entities uh set up to extract fees uh from from from the us system they are rewarded based on list price so they get a fee based on list price so the higher list price the more fee they get for the same job which means that in our experience products that comes with a low list price get less courage it's less attractive and uh that becomes troublesome for patients because patients who do not have insurance or have high deductible plans are then asked to pay the list price we pay on average 7 4% in rebates discounts and fees uh and even more when we are into medicaid uh 340b etc so if we did our business based on net price instead of list price that would mean that our products would be much more affordable for patients and if we simply paid the pbms a small fee for the limited risk and contribution they make uh i think patients would be significantly better off so for every dollar that you sell in medicine how much of that dollar goes to rebates fees and discounts that largely do not get passed on to the patient yeah for every dollar we make uh we give 74 cent to the pbms insurance companies so 74 cents of every dollar let me uh switch to an another issue just to make sure that i understood in your opening statement you seem to say that your largest shareholder is a nonprofit charitable foundation is that correct yes that's correct let me turn to another issue recently your company discontinued production of levir and that is a popular longlasting basil insulin ironically just yesterday i heard from a mother from denmark maine whose daughter takes lemir and feels that it has unique benefits for her clinical situation so making a sudden switch or change in her medication is very much of concern to this mother what led to this discontinuation yeah thank you senator any any decision to stop supplying and medicine is a very difficult decision because we acknowledge that different patients have have different needs um in the case of lir we actually lowered the list price in the us by 65% last year uh just to realize that after we dropped the price of lir the pbms dropped coverage so it went from being on 90% of insurance schemes to being only on some 35% so we see a dramatic uh lower of volumes and uh as i mentioned in my opening we serve 30 million uh people living with taier beads in need of insulin and it's difficult for us to run high volume manufacturing lines with small products because it prohibits us from actually serving all those patients so it was a difficult choice with had to make to make sure that we could sustainably supply enough insulin for all people with type one diabetes but i do acknowledge that it comes at a uh with some stress for individual patients unfortunately well i hope that you will be giving guidance to these families because for some of them this is a real blow and they're very concerned about the impact i want to go back to the cost issue which is critically important how does your company help individuals who are part of low-income families do not have insurance and simply cannot afford your drugs yeah if thank you senator um it's important for us that we also try to help the most vulnerable patients so we have uh worked hard to make sure that scage in in medicaid uh for our our medicines and we also have patients support programs so for instance if you live with type two diabetes and you are in need of a product like oic uh you can contact nor nordisk and if you make less than 400% of the national poverty line which as illustration is $120,000 as a household income you can get a free oic from nor nordisk and i believe we're the only company having such a support program so if your household makes l less than a 120,000 you can participate in your patient assistance program yes and i i i i don't think it's an ideal situation because honestly um patients should have access to insurance because if you live with type two diabetes you're also at risk of having cardiovascular disease kidney disease so you need a a range of of medical support so i think we should have as a shared objective we really make sure that people have access to proper insurance and when they have that we can work with uh different uh mechanisms to make sure that when they at the pharmacy counter they can pick up our medicines for $25 or less in most cases uh but that's difficult when you don't have insurance my time is expired thank you senator lan thank you mr chairman uh m mr jorgenson thank you for being here sir uh in your opening statement you said quote patients need both affordability and access i very much appreciate you saying that now wovi and oic are groundbreaking drugs that are making a huge difference in people's lives the ability to quiet food noise and successfully manage their weight after so many failed attempts is truly a life changing innovation but to make a positive difference in people's lives they have to be able to afford it as well i've heard from new mexicans about unaffordability i'll share a story that i heard from bernardet she's a mother of three in albuquerque new mexico in october of 23 bernardet was prescribed woia for diabetes and the liver condition her insurance denied coverage of wovi three times bernard's wovi prescription would have cost about $1,000 after a $300 discount her doctor then prescribed oic after two appeals bernard's health insurance company approved her prescription even with health insurance bernard's oic prescription would have cost around $1,000 a month bernard it made the difficult decision to not pay $122,000 annually for either w goi or oic both prescriptions prescribed by her doctors she now goes without according to jama the adult hispanic population in the united states has a 45.6% obesity incident black and hispanic people are more predisposed to having type 2 diabetes a condition related to obesity the median household income in new mexico is $6 62,200 or 5,461 a month even with a 40% reduction in the list price the cost of these drugs represent a huge part of the monthly income of new mexicans and hispanic americans i also heard through your testimony the the coupons or things of that nature that are included from the list price why don't you just sell the drug at the coupon price if you're willing to give people a coupon that can afford it instead of that list price that we see on that board thank you senator for bringing up that question and uh and also addressing uh this you know the needs of of hispanic and black populations uh i think that's that's really really important um it is not our intention that anyone should pay the list price um the list price is the starting point for our negotiation against the pbms and and insurance companies in bringing uh courage of our medicines to to to patients and in particular those you you you mentioned here in in having a bigger need um we we see that when there is insurance company coverage there is uh a price point of the $25 i mentioned for 80% of of patients and you can say what about the remaining 20% uh the price point is if $50 or less for 90% of the cases and then there are remaining 10% where there are either uh a situation without insurance or you can say low quality insurance where insurance schemes have high deductible or or certain restrictions on on use of uh of of the products and it's important for me to say we we don't set the price for those patients that's that's a function of the insurance scheme but for those who fall outside of insurance and actually including the income level you mentioned we have uh for for syic a a support program where we try to help them and mr chairman if i may mr jorgenson bernard had insurance yeah couldn't afford it no um so i appreciate the statistics and the number she's a real person mother of three um there's a problem here i've i've i've not quite understood the notion of list prices with pharmaceutical companies and then the price that they're willing to sell the drug act so they can still make a profit this sounds like a game to me and a game that i don't understand but a game i certainly hope in a bipartisan way that we can get to the bottom of i very much appreciate uh senator collins line of questioning at the opening as well legislation that's moved out of this committee deserves to be heard on the floor and i certainly hope we can get there i'm going to move on um before i do while i appreciate very much that the indian health service and the va include coverage for obesity and for other reasons of this drug it's still high it's still a high cost um and when we look at those programs as a whole i'm still very concerned as to what's happening in that space but i look forward to visiting with your team more about that into the future um mr jorganson um because of the work that was done with the inflation reduction act um medicare can finally negotiate the price that seniors pay for prescription drugs and medicare in your written testimony you have acknowledge that oic may be listed in the uh negotiations uh due to its high cost despite these contentions that medicare negotiation will resolve the price nova nordic has attempted to block the law when medicare sought to negotiate the prices of insulins these insulins by the way had the list prices of almost $6,000 annually now as we both know the court rejected that as well my question for you mr jorgenson when you mentioned in your written testimony that you expect oic your diabetes product will be included in medicare's list of drugs for negotiations yes or no should oic be selected for negotiation will you commit to not initiating legal action to stop it so s thank you for for bringing up that question uh so we share the objective of uh making products accessible and affordable for patients no doubt about that um on the uh ira uh negotiation we have had some concerns that if if it's a if it's a real negotiation i i support that but if it's a price setting i i think it will have unintended negative consequences uh to access to to patients uh for for innovation so it's uh it's been described as a negotiation but it's actually a setting of a maximum price so i don't know what price we end up having for our insulins i don't know if the pm pbms will included on formulary at all because of that lower price and impact on on rebating so i have nothing against negotiating pricing with the objective of improving affordability for for patients uh but if it's not a a a fair negotiation but actually price setting i think it will have negative consequences on the innovation being brought to americans mr chairman as i close my time has expired um i would remind you mr jorgenson of those words that you used in your opening statement again patients need both affordability and access i certainly hope that that rings true and i would encourage you to sit down with chairman sanders and the committee staff associate with that pbm letter to find a place where you will lower those prices and do the right thing and send the message to everyone because your drugs will save people's lives 40,000 more people that can't get them today many in the community that don't get them today and i certainly hope we can get to that place thank you mr chairman thank you uh senator codyy i'll defer to senator bud thank the ranking member thank the chair mr jorgenson thank you for being here uh according to reports the north carolina state healthc care plan attempted to limit coverage of um one type of obesity drug the glp 1es that we're talking about today um for enroles to avoid raising premiums now however cvs care mark the state healthc care plans pbm u informed them that they would lose $54 million in discounts if coverage was limited so mr jorgenson do you know if these allegations are true um i have to admit i don't know all the details of the specifics in north carolina but i i don't think we uh stopped paying these rebates so i received a letter from north carolina speaker of the house uh tim moore and includes data on the state health plans board of trustees blaming the inflation reduction act not drug spending on the pl shortfalls so i ask unanimous consent to enter the letter into the record mr chairman thank you mr jorgenson could you describe in as simple terms as possible how federal programs like the 340b drug discount program uh in reimbursement for prescription drugs through medicare part b actually lead to higher prices and i would say higher list prices yeah well we um when we when we set a list price we have to take into consideration what are the rebates we have to to pay because unless we pay rebates into the system uh to when we negotiate against the pbms we're not getting access to the formulary so a a high list price is more likely to lead to more access to patients and on top of that comes additional uh payments we have to give when we are in medicaid when we in 340b programs etc where there are additional uh payments we have to make to make products afford affordable so it leads to higher prices for those patients who then do not have access via insurance or some of these programs because they are faced with a list price and really uh nobody should pay the list price because that's not uh how we intend to do business but we don't control the price set for the patients that's done uh by the insurance schemes we only negotiate against the pbms to make sure that we can move products uh to patients but whether patients get insurance courage and what pay what price they pay we have no impact on it seems like an industry with a lot of strange incentives you know last november the wall street journal reported that pbms often favor drugs with higher list prices um and i appreciate my colleague senator collin's line of questioning um but the favoring drugs with higher list prices is because pm pbms are reimbursed based on a percentage of the drugs list price as i understand it that means pbms are to make more money if they cover the higher uh higher price drugs so here's for an example insulin one type of insulin had a list price of $274 while an unbranded version of the same insulin had a list price of $25 and even though the unbranded version was $250 cheaper the pbm uh didn't cover the cheaper version so and my understanding is only half of americans have insurance coverage for that cheaper insulin so this is a direct result of pbms facing facing or favoring the more expensive type of insulin so i understand and i appreciate your um your statement earlier that whatever is best for patients i believe that you and the the many great team members that you have at novo so mr jorgenson are there ways to reduce these perverse incentives we're asking for suggestions here perhaps this will come in uh ongoing discussions with the committee but in your time here do you have some suggestions to reduce these perverse incentives to deliver savings and value to the patients in need thank you senator um we should really unite around what help patients and uh if you have uh the industry making big risks in r&d making big commitments into manufacturing and then we have to negotiate against pbms and there are insurance companies is not taking much risk and yet uh benefiting from a significant fee linked to the list price i think that's absurd so uh if we could stop linking their income to a list price uh i think that would create an incentive uh that is not as absurd as it is today i would prefer doing business on the net price where i compete against competitors based on what is the real price for our medicine and what is the value of the medicine and these are medicines that are addressing uh societal challenges that are paramount and we talk about the cost of the the medicine but it's it's really the cost of the diseases that's breaking the system and uh we have to find a way where we transact uh in a way where it becomes much more transparent what is the real price of the medicine to really adopt the medicine and mitigate the societal cost that diabetes and obesity is putting on the us healthcare system and economy as you observed kind of outside looking in um what changes would you suggest uh that we consider to move from a list price scenario so where you could and other companies and competitors even could compete on a net price scenario and do you believe that would be better for patients yeah if we if we passed on the rebates we pay uh to the pbm uh and the insurance companies and purchasing organization whatever they called if we pass that on to patients uh then they are faced with the net price at the pharmacy counter uh i think that would dramatically change it to a much more affordable system where it's it's the value of the medicine uh for the patient the prescriber uh that determines what products is being used not uh who gives the highest rebate uh so uh anything that opens up transparency and make it you know really competitive in in a free market context where you compete on on price and value of of medicines i i think would be a great benefit for for american citizens thank you chairman senator baldwin thank you mr chairman um thank you for holding this important hearing about outrageous prices that americans pay for prescription drugs compared to the rest of the world world i remain deeply concerned that pharmaceutical companies continue to put profits over patients patients deserve access to affordable prescription drugs we have taken meaningful steps to lower prescription drug costs for example working with uh chairman sanders and other members of this committee we secured commitments from three companies to cap the cost of asthma inhalers at no more than $35 per month out of pocket moreover by allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices for the first time uh ever 150,000 wisconsinites will soon see significant savings on 10 of the most widely used and costly medications insulin is now capped at $35 per month for medicare patients and next year outof pocket costs will be capped at $22,000 but there is much more work to be done and i'm committed to working with my colleagues to find more ways to lower the cost of prescription drugs and hold pharmac pharmaceutical manufacturers accountable for outrageous prices um today i would like to begin by discussing patient access to medications mr jorgenson your company was originally founded to provide insulin to patients with diabetes for diabetic patients the inability to uh act access insulin can be lifethreatening without access to their prescribed medications patients would be left to scramble to find alternatives or they would be faced with rationing their supplies mr jorgenson you and your company have attributed shortages of your products in including uh gp1s and insulin to manufacturing capacity um you have noted in your testimony that the overwhelming majority of your company's ma recent manufacturing investment is to expand production of glp1 medications however there have been reports of looming discontinuation of insulin products and ongoing shortages of insulin products so is nord noo nordisk shifting manu excuse me is noo nordis shifting manufacturing capacity away from insulin to prioritize manu manufacturing of glp1 drugs thank you senator for raising these important questions and you're right we have a a 100y year history in uh in diabetes we are committed as ever to diabetes we are one of very few companies who are still doing uh research in in insulin we actually have a i would say a breakthrough insulin being reviewed by the fda and we hope to launch that in the us market in a couple of years so so we are as committed to insulin as we have always been um when there's been uh challenges uh in in supply uh it's not because we are taking uh capacity away um there is a market now where insulin pricing is going down dramatically uh i am concerned about the long-term supply of insulin because we have a 100-year commitment to that and we will keep producing insulin uh uh but i think it's becoming difficult for new companies to get in i think it's very difficult for bu similar manufacturers to get into this market because they can simply not get on formulary um so uh right now insin pricing is declining still by 10 20% year over year if this market structure continues uh it'll be challenging to to supply insulin and this is in in dire context to the public uh narrative around insulin price going up so if it's dramatically going down for manufacturers bi similar are not willing to start producing insulin and cost goes up for patients i think that's a good example of how this system is not working but to answer your question we will keep producing insulin we committed to patients in need of insulin um how will your company ensure that the manufacturing capac capacity for critical insulin uh products remains stable within your company i know you were talking a lot about uh other companies but how will we uh how will you ensure that manufacturing capacity within novo nordisk remains stable that's a commitment we have made a priority we have made in the company and i mentioned the discontinuation of levir as a a difficult choice to make because when a product is going down significantly in volume it actually ends up you can say destroying the ability to produce enough on the line because every time you have to produce a different product you lose capacity so we we focus our manufacturing to make sure that we can still supply uh the the 30 million people around the world who need insulin fromo and we continue to do research and development to make sure that people with type one diabetes who i i agree with what has been mentioned today probably live the most difficult uh life of all in terms of having a life- saving medicine they rely on each and every day and they need a company they can trust for supplying high quality products that live up to fda requirements etc and we're committed to to do that so i have your commitment that uh not withstanding the uh manufacturing capacity that you're creating for g gp1s that you will continue to have a focus on providing critical insulin you will not reduce your manufacturing capacity in that area the world market for insulin is actually declining so there's less demand but we are committed to supply uh to the patient that has been using our insulin uh for years also into the future and we'll keep investing in innovation because using insulin is probably the most difficult ult pharmaceutical intervention patient does so staying in range is is difficult h and we have a major innovation in in weekly insulin coming something most physicians would say would be possible impossible to do yet our committed researchers crack the code and we hope uh we have approved for that in the us in the coming uh you know years time and that will simplify how people who rely on on insulin can can dose their insulin and take some of the fee away thank you senator c i will defer to senator marshall thank you dr cassy and thank you chairman sanders mr jorgenson welcome and thank you for attending this uh hearing look noville nordisk is not the villain in the story noville nordisk is not the villain in this story they're a hero we should be here celebrating this miracle innovation that's responding to this diabetic epidemic we have in this country it's a miracle drug 38 million americans with diabetes that we helping out this nation is spending 250 maybe 350 billion dollars a year treating diabetes not to mention the loss of work and here's a drug that's going to help us treat the problem now we all agree on this committee across the senate that the cost of healthc care is too much much and that prescription drugs are too high especially the out of pocket expenses but we need to figure out who the villain is who is the real culprit here who's making the money so on this particular poster you've said it once you've said it twice everybody up here said the same thing whatever the cost is whichever number we want to use novad door keeps 24% of it and the pbms extract 76 uh 74% 26 and 74% so really the pbms are making the bank here let so let's talk about pbms for a second here the real the real culprit in this in this room in this story so these three big parent companies the three big pbms control 80 85% of the industry their gross revenue last year was $ 800 billion their parent companies gross revenue $800 billion this committee's worked so hard on pbm reform we've not passed our delinking bill and i would ask the chairman to consider bringing the delinking bill back to the committee and let us mark it up as well in that delinking bill pbms would receive a flat fee for the efforts as opposed to a percentage of the sell so we go to a flat fee model number and next they just can't possibly be enough transparency on this issue you know i came to congress to save medicare the people of kansas sent me here to save medicare i cannot save medicare without a miracle drug for alzheimer's we're spending i think way over $200 billion doll on alzheimer's disease so if if we thwart the innovation that you're that this type of company does it tells people to stop researching drugs that are going to solve alzheimer's um mr jorgenson let's talk about research and development for a a second uh how many years have you been researching diabetes and then eventually you got you know probably decades ago you started going down this oic path and how many other rabbit holes have you all been down yes thank you senator for for the question uh we have a 100-year research uh effort in in diabetes and uh the the past three decades uh we have been uh researching the gp1s in in in starting in in diabetes and then in obesity and when we started the obesity research efforts everybody thought it was a stupid idea i'm going to sorry to get through this so you've spent three decades specifically on the glp1 model and i'm sure that there was lots of molecules that didn't work out and at the end of the day you've spent an excess of 10 billion dollars of research and then how much money are you going to spend on research this year approximately so we spending approximately 14% of our turnover on on research okay i want to make a quick point here that companies like yours benefit from the trump tax cut the research and development dollars the tax cut on that that expired is that true that you that doing research in this country you benefited from that tax cut we we have no say funding support from the ni uh whatsoever in our research efforts we benefit from tax uh benefits in in different uh situations so the r&b now write the r&d off over a year as opposed to five or 10 years though would be a significant uh would prevent you from re or decrease your reinvestment opportunities yeah perhaps i'm i'm not uh i i don't know the specific uh data in terms of how much we're benefited from it you know the one thing i am disappointed in your company all big pharma is the marketing that they do um i think that the marketing is very influential i really think that congress needs to go back and revisit that as well i think that uh the marketing is so good there's people on this drug that shouldn't be on it um and are being taken advantage of and so i do think we need to go back and look at that um again instead of coming after the hero of this story we need to look in a mirror america needs to look in a in a mirror that nutrition is a big problem in this country and lack of activity the chairman ranking member all of us have worked on community health center funding i think that's where the opportunities to work on the new nutrition problems remains so it's frustrating to me that congress can spend a trillion dollars on the military medicare can spend a trillion dollars but we can't spend $3 billion dollar on primary care3 billion dollar to address the primary care needs of this country which i think would have a big impact and driving down the need for these type of expensive drugs america i said it for 20 years as a physician that america suddenly wants drive-thru health care we want to drive-thru a fast food service that gives me gives medicine to fix our problem rather than addressing the real challenges before us which is our nutrition in this country is is horrible um so i think that's something we need to continue to work on the other thing we can still work on is bringing competition promoting competition to you will bring this price down we've passed legislation the president assigned legislation that helps drive biosimilars and generics to market more efficiently there's several in the in the near in the hopper so to speak but still the fda remains very inefficient very inefficient the fda should focus on the safety of the drugs and then let the physicians and the patient decide if they're right for them that type of a model will drive down that that process by years and i'll just close you know one more time emphasizing that this committee needs to demand that the the the leader bring our pbm reform to the floor but we need to include that delinking bill there's other opportunities to drive this price down again again novas nordic is not the villain in the story thank you i yield back thank you senator hassen thanks mr chair and to you and senator cassidy for this hearing uh mr enson this year novo nordis abruptly discontinued the drug levir and i know senator collins raised this with you but i want to follow up on it on it a bit lamir is a critical insulin product and one of the few long- acting insulins approved for use during during pregnancy by discontinuing levir in january of 2024 novo nordisk interrupted the diabetes care plans of millions of americans with only a few weeks notice will novo nordisk agree to provide any interested company with the necessary information and drug formulation to make levir senor thank you for the question um any any decision to uh take a product off the market market is a very very difficult decision and i have to explain why we had to do that we last year reduced the price for for lir we dropped the price yet to find that pbms dropped access to lir so uh much less patients have access to it i understand that but my question is now that you're not making it and there are still patients who need it will you provide necessary information and drug formulation to other pharmaceutical companies that decide they want to make it we have uh given a years notice uh more than the week you mentioned sir my question is a direct one please answer it or tell me you're not going to we have collaborated and followed up with all those that were brought forward as potential manufacturers but we have not found anyone interested in manufacturing it and if there is a company interested in manufacturing it or the government wants to manufacture it will be happy to collaborate the reality is that the market is disappearing for livia because of how it's contracted and i i i i don't make a decision like that an easy decision i i understand but and and have you worked actively to find a manufacturer to take on levir it sounds like you've had some conversations but are you continuing the outreach because there are some patients who really need this medication yes um the companies we know of uh have not shown interest all the companies that has been mentioned as potential partners on this we have discussed with and none have come forward as being interested so um i will follow up with you in writing to ask for specific steps that you will continue to take over the next let's say three months to find a manufacturer for this drug uh i'd like to move on if i can because in response to a question from senator luhan about um your pricing of um oic and uh wovi uh you said if you drop the price of these obesity drugs pbms would take them off their formularies but here's what the pbms say um siga express scripts the question they were asked is if novo nordis lowered the list price for oic and wovi tomorrow and the net cost stayed the same or went down would your pbm limit access here's what signa express grip said no if if nova nordisk lowered their list price for oic and wovi tomorrow to a price that was the same or lower than current net cost that change by itself would not result in less favorable formulary placement to support this claim the company provided an example it did not disfavor a competing weight loss product eli li lily's zep bound even as it launched at a list price 20% lower than wovi here's what united health group optim rx said no assuming the net price remains the same or lower lowering a medicine's list price would not lead to less favorable formulary rep placement by optimum rx particularly for high demand drugs like oic and wovi to be clear lower list prices and lower net prices support formulary placement and access cvs health care mark said something similar it said the simple answer is no in fact we can point to recent history as a proof point when novo nordisk drastically reduced the price of their insulin novalog in 2023 it did not result in a less favorable formulary placement with kark and they were also asked if oic and wovi were available for $100 per month or less what impact do you expect that it would have on coverage and access siga express says if novo nordis lowered the price uh for plan sponsors to $100 or less per patient per month we would expect the vast majority of our clients to expand coverage and access to these products for diabetes and weight loss assuming clinical evidence continues to support efficacy and safety cvs said lower list prices would open up access for obesity treatment in particular united health group optimar said given the significant price differential for these products across borders a decision by novo nordes to align us pricing more closely with those in other countries would meaningfully increase access for us patients so with that in mind would you please commit to lowering uh the list price of these drugs so uh senator allow me to share a few points before i answer your question is that okay so uh the experience we have is one of losing access when we lower price i know you can always find specific plans that did include a insulin with a lower price but the the the broad uh say totality is that less patients have access to our medicines when we have lowered the price i understand that perhaps the pbms have changed their mind and i'll be happy to to collaborate with them on this because anything that helps patients to get access and affordability we are supportive of and uh we uh the the rebates that were shown before we hand those out they're not in our books so uh if we can if we can go to a dinking model or any model where we we do business based on net price and i'll be more than happy for that but it's not it's not how history has told well but you you've now got these c companies um publicly committing uh to continuing access and increasing access if the list prices are lowered so um i would strongly recommend that with these companies on the record they represent a huge amount of the covered uh patient population in the united states uh that you consider strongly uh lowering the list price um and uh lastly um i just um want to note that um one way of reducing drug prices is encouraging the entry of generic and biosimilar medications which can provide lower cost options uh for patients so um i will follow up with you to i hope get a commitment that novo nordis will not stand in the way of other companies uh coming up with lower cost versions of these drugs that are current if the companies currently have them in development thank you mr chair well i just want to pick up on senator hasson's important point we have in writing we will certainly share it with you commitments from the three major pbms that if you substantially lower your list price uh they would not limit coverage now what i'm hearing from you is that you are prepared notis is prepared to sit down and work with those three companies i am prepared to negotiate that work with you do i have your commitment that you will sit down with the three companies to make sure that they keep that commitment yes anything that can help patients get access i'm i'm supportive of and that also includes collaborating and negotiating with anyone who can help that all right but picking up on senator hasson's point if in fact they keep their commitment are you then prepared to substantially lower the list prices in the united states i have to understand what this entails because uh when i hear uh statements that pbms would accept a low list list price product it needs to go all the way to patient so it means that they talk about insurance companies being their clients it's actually their owners so it needs to get to insurance schemes and it needs to get to the patients because i am aware of that all right but i'm asking you again a will you work with this committee and the pbms yes number two if in fact they keep their word i understand that it's complicated will you in fact substantially lower list prices in this country if it works in a way where patients get access to a more affordable medicine and uh we have you know certainty that it actually happens and not like when we lowed list price prior rounds around that less people got access to our medicine right i understand that we will we will be positive towards that we will be in touch with you and the pbms to work on this and i want to thank senator hassid for that line of questioning uh senator cassidy i'll defer to senator romney i goodness senator cassidy thank you very much appreciate that uh mr chairman and ranking member appreciate the chance to uh uh have this witness here appreciate your willingness to be here um i don't know whether it's voluntary or not but um uh given the nature of our hearings which are mostly opportunities for us to talk and you to listen i appreciate your willingness to be here um you know i guess there were a couple of models that one could have for developing new drugs uh one was the idea of a patent which we'd say we want the private sect to to invest massive amounts of money developing new products new innovations and then if one works to have a patent to allow you to charge whatever you want to recoup a return on investment and make it potentially enormous profit that's one model the other model is to say no we the government are going to develop drugs and we're going to spend our money and and and keep the price down sometimes we live in a fantasy land which is we want you to invest and the industry generally to invest massive amounts of money but then we want you to keep the prices low like that that's fantasy land that's not real that's not reality you you under our system are able to charge whatever you believe the market will bear and get as big a profit as you could possibly get i i presume that's the the the you have taken you you're a fiduciary for your shareholders you're trying to maximize your profit is that right senator i agree with you that i'm not aware of any the government has that has developed a product so it's typically done in in the private sector and and that can only happen if there's patent protection i'm i don't think we we set our price in a way where we uh just look at at our shareholders because we have also an obligation to set a price that it's available and affordable for patients yeah there's no question long term uh your your profit is going to be enhanced if people believe that you are good guys not bad guys and and so there are a number of considerations and considering what's the best return but there are a number of folks that would like you to invest a lot but then to limit what you can get back and somehow uh ascribe malevolent intent if uh if you charge a high price it's like that's the system we have there are alternative systems which is no no we're going to limit how much you can get back in i look around the world i don't recall drugs coming from china and russia and north korea and iran we don't see a lot of innovation coming from there but yes i would love a setting where you invested massive money but then you gave us the products cheap i mean that that's just not that's just not reality and i and i mean i wish there were a way of that to happen but i don't see how that happens and i very greatly appreciate the innovations that have been made by the uh by the industry i i do wonder uh what the what the reason is for the differences in price between what's available here in this country and what's available in some other countries and and i'm not now just talking about wovi and oic and i don't know the pricing differences to the extent they exist around the world but we in this country often talk about how products are much cheaper in canada and the uk and france and germany than they are here why why is that why are we so out of align with the rest of the world in terms of the pricing that comes from the industry not necessarily your own company but but the industry at large yes i think there are sense of a number of differences when if you for instance compare us and european market um if you look at all the innovation that's made uh a lot of it made in this country so the economic activity taking place here uh all of those innovative products uh in 80% 85% of the cases get to the market in the us uh it's only around 40% in europe so in europe there's a there's a sanction of health care there's a rationing of who gets access so the latest innovations are not getting to my countrymen uh but they are in most cases getting to the us so there's a different uh perspective in how you uh you you you look at innovation and when you look at the diseases we're talking about here diabetes and obesity these are very very expensive diseases and we talk about the cost of the medicine but typically in these diseases the cost of the medicine is less than 10% of the total disease burden uh if you if you look at chronic kidney disease where we have shown in our data that for people living with type two diabetes and start using oic you reduce the risk of developing chronic kidney disease by 24% and actually a quarter of all medicare cost goes to people living with kidney disease so so using innovation is a really a big opportunity for driving down the cost of the us healthcare system and there is a general openness for that type of innovation in the us market which is not always the case in europe and that comes with a cost but it also leads to significant benefits for the individual americans but also for the healthcare system and saved cost for these chronic diseases i i would anticipate that in european countries that don't have access to some of the life uh products that are available here that there would be a huge hue and cry on the part of the public saying why can't we have these products but those that are available in both places i don't understand why the price should be different uh if the french and the germans and and the the canadians honor our patents would the companies not be free then to uh charge the same price there that they charge here why charge a lower price there uh than it's charged here so a great question when we compare the prices uh it's not an apple to apple comparison it's it's typically different prices that's being compared and it's it's typically the leist price in the us um and in the us there's not one price uh there are number of different prices so i when we sell our products in in medicaid in vas we get a really really low price we even have support programs where we pay for the medicine for americans there no other place where we uh give products away for free that's only in the us when i look at the government what the government pays for our insulins that is now less than what many governments pay in in europe uh but that's typically lost in the whole translation and referencing to to list pricing which is not the price we get so unfortunately as also the chairman said at the opening it is a very complex uh market and very complex healthcare system that creates a lot of misunderstandings yeah i i must ad i admit i agree the complexity of our pbm system is such that it's very hard for us to figure out just exactly who's getting what and why and and i i happen to believe that one of the reasons our health care cost is so expensive particularly as it relates to pharmaceuticals is the opaque nature of our pricing in this country thank you mr jorgenson senator hickle luk thank you mr chair thank you mr jorgenson for taking the time and indulging us for all these questions uh i think there's some unique histories in the united states uh in terms of government's ability to negotiate prices it we don't have to go into that now but it is a part of it certainly we're we're seeing pbms come here and they point the finger in one direction and the large pharmaceutical companies point their finger in the other direction i think most americans hear that as a hustle as a a rigged game and they're they're they're pointing get get it out of here you look at diab diabetes diagnosis are expected to rise considerably over the coming decades by 2030 they're saying 55 million americans will have type two diabetes uh we could see a nearly 700% rise in the number of young people with type two diabetes in the next 40 years um obviously this is a miracle drug and i think by any measure we should recognize that right off the bat uh and i think the point that you know the lower price offering a lower price insulin made the access of that specific drug levir whichever ones it was decreased by almost more than half that should be frightening and at some point we might want to figure out how to get the pbms representatives and the pharmaceutical companies here together and let both sides in in in a open discussion suggest solutions to this because it's it's not sustainable going forward um one point i want to make we have a company in colorado called verta health that's leading the way to address some of the issues around weight management um uh and long-term solutions to patients with type two diabetes um and in a recent study they provide coaches and and help people navigate what they're eating and when when they exercise vera found that patients with type 2 diabetes who sto taking a glp one and remained on a nutrient or a nutrition therapy program did not reg regain weight uh after a year and had similar blood sugar control as those who are still on the drug now obviously many patients may have aggressive form of obesity the appetites that i don't know you can argue that the appetites in people has evolved over the 90% of the time in our in our evolutionary history we were hunters and gatherers so that's a very hard thing for for many people to control um but for those patients who can control it uh a company like verta health can really provide benefits are you doing any studies to look at that as a kind of a combined therapy or an alternative therapy that people can move on to this less expensive yeah thank you sor i think you raised a a really good point that also alludes to that patients are different we probably know of people who uh who live with say an aggressive form of obesity and no matter what they do they put on weight and most likely they'll have to be on on really efficacious uh new innovations in the future to manage their weight but we might also get to know of patient segments where after efficacious treatment and perhaps with a coaching solution they can change lifestyle to a degree that uh the coaching motivates them to reinforce that and they can do without medicine it's it's still a bit early days and i think we uh we have to acknowledge that for long we have looked at people with obesity and to some degree type two diabetes as as a self inflicted condition so i think we should be careful about saying that you know if you just get a coach and get this digital support you're taken care of because then i think we're letting patients down in need of of significant help but i i believe that there'll be a market for such a solution and it can coexist with with our products and it can also help take the burden of the healthcare system over time so we don't want to move people on on medicines and keep them medicines they do not need but i also note that many americans will need to have help of course for a long time and i rais i raised the question i was specifically trying to make sure that there are different groups of people and obviously the the notion that we everyone can control their appetites is ridiculous and i think we've we have disadvantaged people that that are have differing uh uh genetic makeup and and physiological character uh we uh put them in unfair positions let me go off on a different uh uh direction uh and talk a little bit about uh sugar and and and diabetes and and then some of the other issues that can arise um roughly almost three4 of our food supply in the united states now is made of what we call ultr processed foods um researchers have started studying the possible connection between these ultra past processed foods uh with higher rates of di ies and then also d dementia uh later in life and certainly researchers are still working to understand the exact connection here so i'm not saying this is uh thought or has been consequentially uh defined but there is evidence that diabetes can lead to higher rate of of inflammation as well as damage blood vessels which could impact cognitive functioning as we age uh can you speak on research that noo nordis has uh done on testing the effectiveness of geop p1's or gop like uh pharmaceuticals in reducing the risk of demension is the company company have you guys got research on this connection um you know that that would would be optimistic yeah thank you senator you raised a really good point and uh our gp1 medicine uh semaglutide works in an anti-inflammatory way which has uh tremendous benefits for for for patients it not only lowers weight but it also reduces risk of cardiovascular disease because of this anti-inflammatory properties and we're now also testing it out in alzheimer's disease where we hope we can show in data end of next year that being on this medicine uh can bring benefit for for people with alzheimer's disease so this whole cardom metabolic disease state that is leading to a number of comities is actually also a leading cause of number of cancers we uh we aspire to show in continued massive investments in r&d that we can document these benefits and have them fda approved great thank you and i i'll just end with the um in terms of the whole tenor of the discussion that uh henry ford was famous for coming in and actually dramatically reducing his prices so as to dramatically increase volume and uh dramatically succeeded in a level that nobody really imagined and i think you with a miracle drug like this you might have that same potential where actually lowering the price could dramatically change not only the the success of the of the pharmaceutical but also the success of the business senator cassy um thank you mr jorgenson thank you for being here uh mr jorgenson you had mentioned that u just to clarify for the record that oic would be available with a patient assistant for uh program a papap if if they were insured but they had a high deductible you did not mention that for wovi so if i if a patient has a high deductible andor has a health savings account is and they want they're taking movi for obesity is there a patient assistant program for them uh is or some other assistance for them to be able to afford yeah so first to clarify the what we have on oic um if you if you have uh an income less than 400% of the na national poverty line you can qualify for free oic h if you have a high deductible plan unfortunately when you're inside insurance if you if you actually got a a say a a product for free from nor nordisk or you you you bought it at a say a cash program the insurance company would not count that against your deductible so it wouldn't help you so wait a second though if i have a health a high deductible health plan with a health savings account um and say the drug is whatever it is that $900 um and i've got a deductible of 2,000 let me make sure i understand this one that your patient assistant program would not assist them um and you're saying it's because yes our net price is whatever it is $600 we' be willing to make it more affordable but but that this would not the patient would not benefit ex i lost you there lost you there yeah so uh if you instead uh so so when you're in the deductible space we have still given the rebate to the pbm uh but uh it's not shared with the patient and if you went out and bought say a lower price product because we also have a a cash program that spent uh would not count against your deductible because you have to you have to spend that within say insurance so it wouldn't help the patient and that's a function of insurance scheme design that's not something we uh we control no it actually would help the patient on the other hand because if she' be paying for she' be paying much less but now she's paying $900 but i think i'm hearing from you in the contract or contractual relationship that you have with the pbm that actually seems to be what is first being considered is contractual relationship between your company and the pbm and not the bottom line for the patient cuz the bottom line for the patient she's paying 900 bucks instead of nothing is that a fair statement so let's assume that she has less than 400% of federal poverty so she's less than 400% of federal poverty and and she's got a high deductible plan and are high deductible uh hsa so she would not qualify for the patient assistant program she would not but even if she did she would still have the deductible so i get that but she would use that for another thing she'd use that for urgent care visit as a opposed to the drug benefit yeah that's true we we feel it's it's not appropriate to have deductible plans for patients living with chronic diseases that on an ongoing basis needs to have access to the healthare so when they come to the but that was a value judgment on the basis of the company for the patient i'll just say that because often times those policies are otherwise more affordable let me ask if the patient is uninsured if the patient is uninsured would she qualify for this less than 400% of federal poverty being able to get the patient assistant program yes for the diabetes product we have not yet established it for the obesity program we have a cash offering at approximately half the price that patients can can use um we feel that right now where we are building say insurance coverage and also negotiating uh access to to medicaid that's our focus um and uh that's what we give priority to in terms of supporting patients let me move on one of the tensions here that i mentioned is innovation versus um is innovation versus the ability to afford and i just want to you know echo what marshall and romney said the fact that y'all and others are doing research on the impact of of these drugs to prevent alzheimer's is fantastic i mean this could possibly be part of what makes alzheimer's less of a scourge and that takes money so when someone says they can produce it for $5 yeah they can produce it for $5 but they're not going to produce the $30 billion worth of research that would find another indication for how we go forward so i think we need to acknowledge there is that but it is my impression that the united states is paying for this research and that the other countries are not i'm sure that uh chairman sanders asked if you're making money in germany of course you're making money in germany uh you're making money on the margin but i don't think i it's my impression if you will that it's not the germans who are paying for the ongoing research as to another indication uh now i say that you don't have to respond to it but i'm going to surmise that to be the case the trump administration proposed international reference pricing in which you took a market basket of developed countries germany japan great britain whomever and you put them as a market basket and the us would pay some multiple now for my mind that would force your and others to go back to the europeans and say wait a second no longer is the united states going to pay full freight for the research you also have to contribute they may pay a little bit more but nonetheless you have to pay a little bit more um do you what thoughts do you have about the international reference pricing that was proposed by the trump administration so uh senator thanks for bringing that up um i think again uh we need to really get into what is then the price we're talking about because if you okay now i will accept that you have to to design it correctly but i'm asking more about the concept uh frankly i think the trump administration had kind of a um there were some flaws with it but if but if you could address those flaws what about the concept that it that there should be a market basket and if the us is not going to pay uh for all of the r&d maybe more but not all and that in effect this may force the companies to negotiate a little bit harder with the europeans um conceptually what do you think about that um i think it should be fair in who pays for innovation uh i mentioned also before that uh a significant of the innovation never is launched in europe so a number of the breakthrough therapies uh only make it to americans so americans benefit from i accept that but i'm going to come back to the concept let's assume that we could imagine a way in which you know some of the flaws of the previous proposal were addressed what about the concept of yes there'll be a market basket of developed countries that typically are paying you know full freight it wouldn't be the pep far program in africa paying pennies on the dollar and that the us would pay some multiple but it would be a lower multiple than we're currently paying we'll be happy to look at that i think we'll find that uh the perceived multiple is much lower than we actually think i just mentioned the example of insulin today the us us government pays less for insulin than uh uh typical typical european governments yet we talk about insulin being more expensive in the us than it is in europe that's not the case for the manufacturer so so we need to decompose the complexity to get to what is the real price uh and uh i'll i'll be happy to to contribute to i also want to point out there's been a lot of faith being placed in pbm saying that they would pass through a lower price but i do want to point out on the 20th the washington post had an article speaking about how the federal trade comm commission has indicted the three largest pbms uh for uh manipulating the price of insulin and one of them said rebates is our sweet drink or something like that and so so i'm hoping that they would be sincere on that but i will not and by the way they dispute that pbms are disputing this but there was this file by the ftc and uh with the chairman's permission i'll submit that for the record um then my last question before i move on before i kind of let others go is um i will stop there okay i may have a second round but i'll stop there senator kane thank you mr chair and i want to i want to pick up right there um i am very proud of the work that this committee and congress has done on the prescription drug pricing issues the inflation reduction act capping insulin uh c apping and then progressively reducing out- of-pocket costs for folks under medicare part d negotiated pricing supported all those things the great thing about the ira it passed by one vote so i'm telling everybody i was the deciding vote on all of these matters we were all the deciding vote all of us who voted yes and some of those provisions weren't loved by the pharmaceutical companies but i've voted for them and i'm i'm proud of them but um i have come to conclude along with a number of my colleagues that uh the focus on pharmaceutical companies is something i support we're letting pbms get away scotf free one company one one industry researches one doesn't one industry produces life-saving treatments one doesn't one industry is super duper profitable and another one profitable the one that's the super duper profitable is the one that's not doing any research and not producing any life-saving innovations one industry is under fairly intense scrutiny by this committee in congress and one isn't and it's the one that's the super duper profitable one that is not researching and not producing products that is getting away scout free in may of 2023 we passed a great bill out of this committee i think it was actually four bills and if i remember by memory i think the votes were 18-3 18-3 19-2 and 20 to1 overwhelming bipartisan bills finally to regulate pbms and i'm disappointed that those bills haven't gone anywhere i turn on my tv and i see the pbms running all kinds of ads against congress telling congress you know not to vote for the scary pbm reform bill if we're going to bring prescription drug prices down even more we shouldn't let up on having mr jorgenson and other ceos here in pressing them but we got to get serious about the pbm reform piece of it mr jorgenson you were here i'm just going to go into this you were here in may of 2023 and i asked you a question about the connection between list price and formulary placement you and and and i will say chairman sanders this was the single best hearing i've attended in 12 years in the senate the hearing where you had both the pbms and the pharmacy ceos together because you're familiar with the phenomenon everybody blames the party that's not in the room we had them all at the same table you and your two ceo colleagues testified that pbms prefer the drug with the high less price and it's difficult if not impossible to get a formulary placement for a drug with a lower list price and that's because they often make a profit on the discount or rebate they can negotiate off a list price and this perverse incentive artificially keeps drug prices too high so then i followed up and asked this question to the pbm witnesses and i asked about this and as you might expect they were not direct in their answer i asked one witness quote so you do not have any fee structure in your company where you collect a fee based on the percentage of the list price the response i received after a long pause we certainly may have a few in our client base everybody in the room that knew that answer was a complete dodge and that was over a year ago senators marshall tester and i have been working for over a year on a bill that would address this issue the drug act would dink the list price of a drug from pbm profits in favor of a flat fee we had hoped that might have been included in the markup this thursday i'm i'm sorry that it won't be but we're going to continue to make it happen color me skeptical that an industry that is now giving us pie in the sky statements about the what they're willing to do but that's all that's also buying advertisements on tv trying to attack congress for doing pbm reform are me skeptical that they're going to come to the table and suddenly you know have a conversion experience and start doing the right thing but but i guess one evidence of whether they're doing the right thing is since you were here in may of 2023 have pbms changed their practices or are they continuing to favor higher price drugs on the formulary and make it difficult to put lower price drugs on the formulary thank you senator for the question question um we have not seen a wide uptake of the insulins where we lowered the price uh they can always find special forms uh formularies where where they're present but we have reduced access to those insulins compared to other insulins so uh like you i'm also a bit skeptical uh but i'm willing to explore the opportunity of what we can do together all of us to benefit patients uh living with these mean as as a general matter you might think if the pbm saw the help committee vote a bill out to the floor that was going to put some significant regulation on it by an overwhelming bipartisan margin they would think man man maybe we better improve a little bit i've se no evidence of improvement i see ads on tv attacking congress and telling them not to do pbm reform so i i want to get the balance right here i'm going to continue to vote with this committee to vote focus on pharmaceutical companies and bring down prices and if the pharmaceutical companies don't want to negotiate for prescription drug pricing under medicare i stand with those who think negotiation is a good idea but we're letting a huge part of this problem that afflicts the everyday american who's trying to afford prescription drugs we're letting them go scotf free and we've got a good bill on the floor right now that i think with some improvement could do a great job and i i hope we'll take it up and i hope we'll devote the same attention and focus to the pbms as we do to the pharma companies with that mr chair y back senator brun thank you mr chairman we've had so many discussions like this and i wish i had a big uh something to hold up but i want to just talk about this it has nothing to do with pharma it happens it has everything to do with a system that's broken with no transparency no competition barriers entry and by the way a consumer who doesn't have the tools to really measure what the best value is this is a case in california that impacted a sophisticated self-insured plan and it had a psychiatric uh underpinning to it but how that could ever end up being $4 million that's what the company paid for that case a self-insured company that's going to be a lot more sophisticated than any individual would be siga the insurance company got 2.5 million of what the company paid another multiplan tpa got about 700,000 the provider that actually provided the service and other words to affect the cure or the remedy got 875,000 they are suing the insurance company because they think they didn't get paid enough and who got screwed was the company and the patient when it was a $4 million claim and the provider that provided all the services charged only 875 and they made a profit so that means the claim was probably 10 times the amount of the underlying cost of the service that's one side of health care hospitals used to be about onethird of the healthc care dollar practitioners nurses and doctors maybe independent pharmacists throw them in there at about oneir and then pharma and insurance splitting the other third so the whole thing has gotten convoluted and then we're talking to today about your industry and i come from the world of distribution and in any other industry there's full transparency competition the consumer drives the dynamic that's why you don't get by with all the stuff we're talking about your business is largely one of heavy fixed costs is that correct yes that's correct and uh and research uh yes which that'd be part of it research anything what are your variable costs generally on a drug like this so so the ro as a percentage of your whatever you're selling it for that's perhaps uh 20% so it's very low are you making a profit on your oic product when you're selling it to australia for $87 and you're selling it to the us for $936 are you making a profit at $87 um yes we are and uh the price you mentioned in the us is not what we get that's the list price so what are you getting in the us what price so um i mentioned that on average for our products we give uh 74% in rebates to uh to pbms and and that was a chart that senator marshall held up that pbms are making 74% you're getting 26 so you've got a screwed up industry number one when i've talked to other pharma folks they regret that pvms ever came into it it would seem like since you make the product the you could disassemble them or do something that would go around it if in fact this place won't do something about it have you ever thought of that it's very difficult senator because they control what insurance is put in front of patients um so they have integrated themselves with insurance companies uh and we negotiate against the pbms but they owned by the insurance companies so no matter what we do they decide what products pay okay and i think we that's kind of the can but you're making a profit at $87 and of the 936 it would be the list price is that total being split between you and the pbm i know you give big discounts to the pbm why do you give them such large discounts for them to make that much money um unless we uh have a high list price and give them rebates we are not making it onto the insurance formulary uh so they make a fee based on the list price so you mentioned distribution they don't get a flat fee for the for the distribution they so after you give the discounts and you do everything what is your revenue on oic roughly so i i don't have that number from the top of my head so on a that'd be something i think it ought to be on the top of your head because most of us would want to see that so you can make the case against pbms and that basic lack of transparency that to me comes from the top the cloaks the system in general is what is impacting the future of why in our own country it's 18% of our gdp in from canada to europe it's 10 to 12% of her gdp eastern europe is 6 to 7% and yes rationing is maybe going to be one of the results but it should never be to where something is going to cost that much more here versus there when you're making a profit on it and until you figure that out everyone's going to think your industry is screwed up so um i'm not sure if it it was a question but i just want to say that since we launched a product like oic in 18 the price we get has gone down by 40% so so uh there's a and that's good and it looks like lily has got something similar and they sense competition and theirs is gone down by 40 to 50% and that's what we need more of and until you put it out there expose the pbms in terms of what they're getting and you get consumers engaged in it you're not going to solve the problem you're going to end up having government as your business partner because when you operate like an unregulated utility you're going to get government regulating you and i think there's a strong interest in that happening and unless you hospitals insurance take the bull by the horns you're going to increasingly be in more conversations like this and i want to end on this so why should the europeans and everyone else be um taking advantage of the fact that we do the r&d why don't you charge them more to where there's at least not a 10 to one differential to where you share the costs across the world not put it on the burden of a place that's now borrowing 30 cents on every dollar for whatever is provided through government and where you're you're jabbing it through the private insurance side now why is there that kind of difference uh why don't you charge them more in europe so senator we might also uh do that in the future but actually the price differential you mentioned is not the real price differential i think that's part of the problem that uh we are not uh in charging as much in the us as you as i think you're hiding behind your opaqueness and you need to promote transparency for your own good it'd be easier to understand thank you mr chairman thank you senator brun and thank you mr jorens let me just make a few remarks i senator brun and i come different perspectives but occasionally we agree that the system is broken uh senator b said the industry is screwed up is that the great quote i don't agree that it's screwed up it's enormously profitable this is a company that makes huge profits top 10 pharmaceutical companies made over hundred billion dollars in profit last year it's not screwed up they are making huge amounts of money uh and i think mr jorgenson you are not quite correct when you talk about 79% rebates on oic and movi that may be in general my understanding it's a 40% rebate that's i believe that i have heard that that in fact the product uh that after all of the rebates uh from the pbms your product is about foric about $600 can i clarify that please so our price has gone down by 40% since launch and already when launched it that was a significant rebate so the rebate has gone up by 40% since launch on top of a launch rebate my understanding is that factoring in and we all agree it is a complicated and broken system i would point out and you correct me if i'm wrong mr yenson that in your beautiful country denmark anybody can walk into a doctor's office go to the hospital how much do they pay out of pocket in denmark we have say a healthcare system that's tax paid yes and how much as an individual pay out of if i'm in the hospital in two weeks and then i come pay out of pocket to go to the hospital yeah uh zero zero if you go to any doctor zero and you are spending a little bit more than half as much per capit as we are so they provide quality care for all of your people and almost half of what we do all right that's a simple system that to my mind makes sense sense we have a complicated system not only in healthcare but in prescription drugs as well but the point that i want to make is that factoring in all of the rebates we heard a lot about rebates i agree with much of the criticism factoring in all of the rebates the pbms receive the net price of oic is still nearly $600 over nine times as much as it costs in germany and the estimated net price of agoi is over8 $800 nearly four and a half times as much as it costs in denmark i know senator romney others said well how is that so why is it so much less expensive in europe and the answer is obvious in the united states of america we are the only major country on earth that does not has not negotiated prices so you can charge us any price that you want other drug companies can charge us any price that they want as much as the market will bear and that's what you do understandably you charge us far more than other countries because they negotiate and regulate prices now the good news and i share the concerns and the skepticism about pbms but we have as i've mentioned you and will share with you statements from the three major pbms that they would not pedal lie novo noce in terms of formula placement if you substantially lowered list prices and i look forward to sitting down with you your representatives and the three pbms to make sure that that happens uh senator c do your closing remarks yes uh mr jorgenson again thank you for coming here i'm sure it's like getting your eye teeth pulled um we spoke though about those patients who have high deductible plans or health savings accounts and often they have them because that is what is affordable and works best for them and it's been my concern that it seems as if the system has been set up to drain those in order to subsidize other actors within the system knowing that your current negotiations with pbms offer no relief for them i would say that if we are truly concerned about people who are trying to purchase insurance trying to do the best thing for their family and then they have a system which manipulates that process to drain their savings in order to to pay for a drug as great as your drug is that's wrong if you look demographically um the pe the people who have the greatest incidence of um a high bmi of obesity are going to be folks who um probably the lowest two to three quintiles of the american population those who might be more likely to have that high deductible policy because that is what's more affordable to them so there's this kind of this train wreck of those who are trying to do the right thing by their family by their own health are the ones who have no allowance made for them in these negotiations between pharma and between pbms that is separate from needing the profits which i thoroughly agree to drive innovation because i'm all about that innovation but i'm all about that family so as yall go forward on that that would be something i think would relieve tension between policy makers and and companies such as yours and the pbms if more consideration were given to them with that i close thank senator cassidy that is the end of our hearing today i want to thank mr yenson for his participation for any senators wish to ask additional questions questions for the record will be doing 10 business days tuesday october 8th at 5: pm i ask unanimously consent to enter the record 10 statements from patients doctors and others concerned about the high cost of asmic and wovi the committee stands and jed e for<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> maybe some of these startups are trying to have to work harder to justify the hype. deirdre bosa, it sounds like  right now we're at 85 miles an  hour and no one is taking their  foot off the gas.  >> we are. we probably need to be going 150 miles an hour to justify these  valuations. the momentum is there. let me first give you the  takeaway, the private gen a.i.  bubble. it continues to inflate. something else is going on, too, the darlings in the space are  beginning to deliver more  revenue helping to justify those lofty valuations that ever  higher rounds. according to a document that i  viewed, anthropic is telling  investors that it is expecting  $1  lofty val rauations at ever hig  rounds. it is expecting a billion  dollars in revenue this year. that would be an increase of  more than 1,000% year over year. now the breakdown of it, which i also saw, that gives us a glance at how the gen a.i. startup is  making money. third-party api is expected to  make up the majority of sales,  60 to 75% of the total. that refers to the interfaces  that allow external developers  or third parties like amazon's  aws to build and scale their own a.i. applications using  anthropic's models. that is by far its biggest  business with direct api sales a distant second, projected to  bring in 10 to 25% of revenue. chatbots, that is its  subscription revenue from the  chatbot is expected to make up  15% of sales in 2024 at $150  million. now in terms of profitability,  this document suggests  anthropic, at least for now, has thinner margins than typical  saas companies. the aggregate is 38% that likely has to do with hyper upfront  costs like the need for gpus,  which we know are expensive and  result in high infrastructure  and operational expenses. investors, though, especially in venture capital, are willing to  look past those expenses if the  top line is growing at 1,000  plus percent, better revenue  growth helps those valuations  look somewhat more reasonable. the information reported  anthropic is in talks to raise  another round with a billion  dollars in projected sales this  year, its sales to valuation  multiple would actually be lower than it was nine months ago. same story for openai and  scale.ai as they continue to  grow faster than their valuation increases. to be sure, guys, these are  valuations. there was skepticism that  anthropic will actually hit this target but there could be  recurring revenue in the gen  a.i. space. scale.ai posting that his  startup hit a billion dollars in arr growth in a would be a four  times increase year over year. of course these numbers are  small compared to the mega caps, but what they do suggest, guys,  these upstarts, they have  momentum, and they're making  inroads even against these  powerful, well capitalized  incumbents. >> i wonder -- so a.i. has the  partnership and the investment  with microsoft, and it was  always -- anthropic has a  relationship with amazon, right? >> and google. >> so i'm wondering if those get closer, why can't an anthropic  be to an amazon or a google what a.i. is to a microsoft? >> what openai is a to a  microsoft? the document tells us the  majority of that revenue is  coming from that partnership. that's third-party apis, i would imagine amazon's aws uses -- or  has a lion's share of that right because they have this  partnership. they're developing their a.i.  applications in the cloud using  anthropic's model. that is still a big source of  revenue. you have to wonder a lot of the  mega caps are looking at  developing their own  foundational models, maybe based on open source models. so is this revenue going to keep coming? i think that's where some of t<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> higher after that mid morning  dip. let's turn to the election. both candidates laying out their tax plans. robert frank has more on former  president trump's growing list  of tax cuts, robert. what have you found in the  details? >>> former president trump  started his campaign with a plan to extend those 2017 tax cuts,  estimated to cost the government about $4.6 trillion over ten  years. then he started adding more. he called for ending taxes on  tips. that could cost up to $200  billion. he promised to end taxes on  social security. that's another $1.6 trillion. he said he would end taxes on  overtime. that's another $1.8 trillion. he wants to lower the corporate  tax rate for domestic  manufacturers to 15% from 21%  adding another $700 billion in  lost revenues. last week in new york he called  for, quote, getting salt back,  presumably to resolve that $10  billion cap on local and state  tax deductions adding $1.2  trillion to the deficit. add it all together, trump  happens proposed tax giveaways  totaling nearly $10 trillion  over a decade. now he has said that tariffs  will pay for at least some of  those tax cuts. analysts estimate the tariffs  would raise about $2.8 trillion  at best which means his current  tax plans woul<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Markets could be in for an 'everything rally', says EMJ Capital's Eric Jackson<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> rate cut and deinverting yield  curve are some factors that  could drive gains in the tech  sector. where might investors look for  opportunity? joining us is eric jackson. someone who i know is happy the  fed did dunl, right, the 50  basis point cut. you're in these high beta tech  stocks looking for the fed cut. so are you repositioning? are you doubling down? what are you doing now? >> well, you're a student of the fed history, so the lasttime  that the yield curve was  inverted for so long and finally broke out to the upside the way  we've seen recently, in a benign economic environment where rates are cutting down was august of  1982. when that happened, and there  was a stock market rally, which  lasted ten months. nasdaq went up 107% over those  ten months. so i think we could be in for an everything rally. it's not just small cap tech,  although that will participate. it will be the magazine 7, other stuff, too. >> like bitcoin, which is going  up, gold is going up,  commodities are going up. that speaks to the everything  rally. so tesla, there's a lot of  excitement around tesla lately. deliveries coming in. also we get the robotaxi day on  the 10th. you say it's the biggest a.i.  stock which is not fully  recognized as an a.i. play. why? >> we also got the china news  and that benefits tesla as well  overnight. the full self-driving is  obviously what's going to drive  the row boection taxi event. full self-driving is all no neu  nets, all a.i. they are the leaders in the  world in terms of miles driven. they have all this information  which is making it better and  better. so, i just don't think they have gotten the credit to this point  for being an a.i. play that they will. the morale is going to continue  for tesla as we've seen since  august 5th. at least through the row  boe  robotaxi event next month. if you watch the larry  ellison/oracle investor day  talk, it's clear he's a huge fan of elon and tesla. i don't think there's anybody in tech i respect more than larry. even though he went off the  board of tesla two years ago,  people forget part of what  happens when he did that, he  doesn't have to do any filings. so he has likely not sold any  shares. they're probably worth $9  billion today from the $1  billion in december -- >> i don't know how larry is  feeding his family at this  point. does the elon musk factor,  factor into any of your tesla  analysis? obviously, polarizing uy. you know, you hear these stories about people say, i can't buy a  tesla anymore because it's elon  musk. does that factor in at all or is that sort of media, twitter  hype? >> it factors for good and for  bad, brian. i think the good is way, way,  way more than the bad. this is a guy landing rocket  ships on platforms in the middle of the ocean. i think for tesla shareholders,  the fsd story is an elon story. you take the good with the bad. and it's still a great, great  story going forward. >> this is a great story. if you haven't been to easton,  maryland, lately, on the eastern shore a guy named paul craiger  putting all of his money and  time into making easton a  destination. that's where my an ccestors wer  hanging out years ago. he's running a group, crypto,  energy, et cetera. he's built a fortune in energy. what is it about this story that paul and his team are doing at  terra wolf that you like so  much? >> there are two smaller cap  storiespy like. terra wolf is one. defy technology is the other. they're both crypto stories. terra wolf is an energy story,  brian. i know you're the energy guy at  cnbc. the whole three mile  island/constellation news we got shows we don't have enough  energy to compute the a.i. needs coming up. core scientific did a deal  earlier this year as a bitcoin  miner with core weave to provide them with immediate hookups to  the grid. every bitcoin miner has the same kind of story. they will do sam deals. terra wolf is smaller than core  scientific. it's next in line. i like it a lot. the other name i'm a huge fan of on a valuation basis is this  smaller company, defy  technologies. crypto provider in europe. they're coming into u.s. trades at six times next year's  priced<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> U.S. Steel CEO defends planned sale to Nippon, says deal will 'close on its merits'<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> national security grounds. joining us for the first time on cnbc to discuss the merger and  much more, we've got u.s. steel  ceo dave burritt at the new york stock exchange. thank you.  >> it's a pleasure to be here. thank you for having me.  >> we'll get into the deal, but  i want to ask you about why  you're here in new york. it's climate week. i don't necessarily think of the steel industry on the front  lines of decarbonization. what are you doing on that  front? >> it's actually good for  someone to ask me about the  business and how the business is going, so rear really delighted  that we're going to be  recognized as the first steel  company to be certified in the  world by a responsible steel. we have our big river steel in  arkansas, we're completing  duplicating the capability there by the end of this year. so, that facility now is the  first in the world to be  certified by responsible steel,  which is the gold standard for  these types of certifications. really excited to see this  progress in the business. >> how far are you along this  way, this journey? >> there's a long way to go. we've done a good job. we're ahead of our climate  targets for 2030 and we were the first steel company in the  united states to set a 2050  goal. we're committed but there's  nobody should underestimate the  amount of work that's required  to do this.  >> absolutely.  >> with nippon and their  capabilities, that should be a  much bigger plus. >> is that another argument on  the deal for the environmental  front? >> absolutely. they are the leaders in  integrated mills. they have already demonstrated  some 33% reduction in ghg  emissions with their blast  furnace. they have already that  capability. they made progress. and they're over a decade ahead  of us here in the yas. so they have the technology that makes it better for the planet. that's exciting.  >> i mentioned the back drop. vice president harris opposes  it. former president trump opposes  it. president biden opposes it. why do you have confidence that  this deal will go through? >> well, we strongly believe the deal closes on its merit. if you think about what it does, it checks all the boxes for all  the stakeholders. it's not just great for our  stockholders but great for our  customers, our employees, the  country, as i just said, even  the planet. it checks all those boxes very  nicely. >> the union would disagree. that's been a big point of  contention. why are they so opposed to it? >> i didn't invite them to come  to the table. they have been invited many  times by nippon. it would be great if they took  the time to understand it  better. we've been very clear. japan has been very clear. nippon has been very clear. u.s. steel has been very clear  on what the benefits areand how this will help not just the  stockholders, but most  importantly, the workers. and the workers -- the members  like the deal as well. >> how would you describe your  relationship with the union? it feels very tense and it feels like this is one of the major  reasons why this deal would not  get done.  >> i think the main thing to  focus on is the deal would get  done and the relationship that  the usw international should be  thinking about is what our  relationship is with nippon. we have a great relationship  with our workers in u.s. we have a great relationship  with employees, our members, but the focus should be, my view,  that the international should be thinking about the relationship  they would like to have with  nippon. >> they're thinking about  keeping it american and the  relationships with  cleveland-cliffs, which is also  interested in buying you. >> well, clev cleveland-cliffs   our focus. our focus is on closing the  deal. and closing the deal with  nippon, our benefits are  immense. it strengths national security,  strengthens economic security  and strengthens job security. if you think about the  ingredients that have come to  the table, the information, the  money that nippon has brought to the table, above the basic labor agreement, and they don't have  to go above and beyond the basic labor agreement. what they've said is as a result of this transaction, there will  be no layoffs. they've also said above the  basic labor agreement, which  expires september 1, 2026,  they're willing to invest $1.4  million in the integrated mills, in the unionized facilities. and there's more. they're also going to  rejuvenate, re-energize, improve mon valley with a $1 billion  incremental investment in that  facility and also in gary,  indiana, a blast furnace over  time that would be dialed down. they'll invest $300 million to  give that asset decades worth of more life, just like at mon  valley. all of these investments improve<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Boeing proposes 'final' offer to 30,000 striking machinists<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> balance sheets, that potentially they are fairly valued. >> i like how you threw in the  united nations general assembly, you have to be bearish on stocks and bullish on new york city  traffic. >> i'm excited to stay downtown. >> thank you. >> we're watching boeing make  its best and final offer to  30,000 striking machinists in  the seattle area. phil lebeau with an update. hi, phil.  >> boeing shares are sliding a  little lower because it appears  that while this may be its best  and final offer, the union may  not even vote on it. the offer was made yesterday. it includes a 30% wage hike over the next four years. that's an increase compared to  25%, that was the previous  offer. but the leadership immediately  blasted the offer and have said, look, you didn't come to us. we didn't negotiate this. you just put it out there for  the rank and file. we're not planning on voting on  this. this comes at a time where the  cost of the strike is estimated  to be about $500 million per  month. that's one estimate that is out  there. the free cash flow impact even  greater. and liquidity right now stands  at $12.6 billion, which now  raises the question, when does  boeing get to a point where it  says, we need to raise equity? a couple notes out from  analysts. wells saying, sweetened offer  would trim free cash flow by  half billion dollars a year. still may not be enough. td cowen says ba's hiked  machinists best and final offer  may have difficulty winning  approval but should encourage  union leaders to re-engage. according to goldman, we now  assume boeing will raise $12  billion of equity before  year-end and following a  resolution of current labor  negotiations. by the way, boeing, as you take  a look at shares since the  strike began on friday the 13th, boeing has said it wants a vote  on this latest offer by 11:59  p.m. pacific time friday night. as i said earlier, guys, the  union has said, we<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> confidence at its lowest level  in more than three years. what does it mean for markets,  your money and rates, joining us at post 9, ubs alignment  partners managing director ally  mccartney. good to see you.  >> good to see you. happy to be your first guest.  >> first guest for me ever. i've never hosted this show  before. take it easy on me.  >> it is your debut, maybe my  finale.  >> i'll tell you at the end.  >> i get a rating. the romain january judge gives  me a four. you heard all the things we laid out. what are you and your team most  focused on right now? >> we're relatively bullish. as you said, you can lay out the bear case, but there's a lot of  reasons to lay out the bull  case. you quoted in the last hour  something about an indefinite  expansion. i think an indefinite expansion, that's an interesting use of  words. what i would say is you're  looking at a number of things  that are fueling the market. you're looking at a fed that is  finally, quote, unquote, not  behind the curve but maybe on  the curve. that support equities. you're look, at u.s. election  where likely about 50% puts us  in gridlock, which means not a  lot of major sweet bang tax or  regulatory changes could or  would happen. and a regulatory trend in u.s.  large cap. there's a lot of reasons why we  have a 6200 for mid-year next  year and that's why we think  pullbacks are a good buying  opportunity.  >> you're talking about a lot of the reasons why the market has  rallied already. i guess not worrying about some  of the risks given a lot of what you said is priced in? >> yeah. i do think that's fair. the other side of that is you're talking about a market that also has an extraordinary historical  level of buybacks built in. there may be a weak sort of  seasonal implication because  we're going into earnings season and some of that is going to  disappear for a while. and you also have, in addition  to earnings, you have all of  this cash currently or last week was earning, let's say, over 5%. this week is earning less than  that. that's likely going to go back  into the markets. so, there really still is  momentum to push that forward. >> is there a case to be made  where fundamentals -- i'm going  to say something -- >> i like fundamentals. >> i don't know if they matter. we heard brian moynihan, leslie  picker interviewed brian  moynihan and he said at the end  of the interview, every day  we're buying our stock. when it goes down, companies  step in and buy their stocks at  massive levels. if companies are at, let's call  it a put, in the market, do  fundamentals matter when  companies come in and buy their  own stock and send it higher? >> fundamentally mattering is a  relative concept. when we talk about things like  an indefinite expansion, we're  also talking about -- after bull markets come bear markets. after contraction comes  expansion. after the financial crisis we  have had an extraordinary amount of money supply, global  synchronized financial easing,  financial tightening, so there  are all of these things out  there whether it's in money  supply or in bids that are  certainly going to force sort of massive changes. and the truth is that you talked about we're still at a 3% gdp  number. we're still at secular trends  that are going to continue. although we have waning spending in fiscal department, there's  still a huge bid. as you discussed everything  happening with china and being  discussed this week, the u.s. is still doing relatively well  compared. and then you have companies,  let's say, like the microsoft  and some of those companies that although they are highly valued, you could argue, given the  financial mo<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Tesla move higher about deliveries shaping up nicely and upcoming robotaxi event, says Baird's Kallo<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> magnificent seven but a  significant rebound. here with more on the road of  ahead for tesla, and its stock  price as it gets ready to report its latest delivery numbers, an  outperform rating on the stock. ben, to what do you attribute  the recent significant move  higher in the shares? >>.  >> probably two things really. deliveries shaping us, and then  second, you know, all eyes on  the robo taxi event on october  10 and i think there could be  some surprises there. the lower cost vehicle in  addition to the robo taxi and  the plan to roll that out in a  couple cities at first is what  we think.  >> i would assume we're all  going to get focused on that as  you said october 10th  announcement pushed back as we  know. so you think the possibility is  there of a new announcement of a lower cost vehicle assuming  they're going to share  significant advances that have  been made on full self-driving  and the like.  >> we do. it makes sense for the timing. they talked about releasing a  lower cost vehicle as early as,  you know, the first quarter of  next year to get that out in  front of people that makes sense from a timing perspective. this is not the next generation  vehicle but a low-cost vehicle  probably produced in austin as  well as in berlin to use their  current factory footprint before they start extending it to new  factories. >> is that in your estimates? can you model out what sort of  revenue stream that looks like? >> thanks, sara. good question. we have only 25,000 units in q4  of next year. volume numbers likely need to go up, at least for us. i think in general, now they  will have to take lines down to  bring up the new vehicle so it  will be a lumpy 2025 and you're  switching out volume of a higher priced vehicle with a lower cost vehicle. there will be movement in  numbers there. i think most importantly is  having a new vehicle out, the s, the 3, x, y, cybertruck, so i  think this will be a new product out there could give the stock  moving higher than it is now. >> you know, ben, just a couple  years ago the idea of even  asking whether or not tesla can  compete with the likes of  chinese ev makers would seem to  have been heresy. i asked the question of you,  many others asking right now,  how do you see the global  competition evolving given what  has been this appreciable income in terms of the quality of  chinese evs? >> i think that musk has been  very clear that the biggest  competition is coming from  china, not just in vehicles, but also in autonomy and full  self-driving and so, you know,  we've watched that very closely. tariffs into europe, definitely  help tesla, there is a different segmentation where tesla is  viewed as a higher end. the model 3 refresh they did in  china is helping sales and i  think that we'll see a model y  refresh as well in china that  should help with sales there as  well. but when we get to the actual  numbers, when they report  numbers probably two weeks after the 10/10 event all eyes will be on margin because they have been doing things like paying down  interest rates giving 0%  financing in china that did  impact margins last quarter. we expect it to impact margins  this quarter as well.  >> yeah. and on full self-driving itself, you know, what are you seeing in terms of performance with  wherever they are right now,  12.5? they've incorporated generative  ai and i hear a lot of progress  being made. is that really the case? >> we think so. and we've had the opportunity to ride in different iterations of  the version 12 and a 12.5 maybe  two weeks ago, and, you know,  there's been the pace of  progress is accelerating and  this is really because, you  know, as they've talked about,  they're no longer compute  constrained. they have this, you know,  millions of cars on the road  gathering data there and it is a full end-to-end machine learning versus in the past there were  other pieces of the software  that people had to code. i think that's one thing we're  trying to emphasize is that this is accelerating at a faster pace than it has, you know, in the  past and there's so mu<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Soft landing is the base case over the next 12 months, says S&P Global's Satyam Panday<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> that's what a soft landing is,  right. it just --  >> goes on and on.  >> doesn't land.  >> never lands.  >> let's get to the road ahead  for markets given the backdrop. joining us at post nine,  evercore isi julian emanuel has  the second highest s&p target on the street at 6,000 alongside  globally chief economist,  pressure off the release of  their new q4 economic outlook  slowing gdp growth and more fed  rate cuts. good to see you both. indefinite expansion? is that possible? >> well r i will believe it when i see it, but at least we know  that the baseline case for the  next 12 months is one of a soft  landing, most likely scenario. it seems like the fed is on its  way to stick that landing with  the neutral rates coming down to where they think it's between  2.5 and 3.5. it looks like we are getting to  the trend growth rate more than  anything else at the moment.  >> so what does that mean? we're tracking almost 3% growth  for this quarter.  >> we are tracking almost 3%  growth for the second quarter  and the third quarter. i think there are some red flags in the consumer caution that's  creeping up, like the confidence index that we saw this morning,  and some of the fiscal direct  contribution to growth coming  from state and local governments those should be reversing to  more historical averages. so those positive surprises are  sort of behind us now, and it  will be more in line with your  personal income growth and  that's why we have revised down  our growth profile. but still, it is a 2% growth  profile. nothing, you know, that suggests it's a recession in the horizon. >> in china they're more  concerned about lack of growth. i'm curious to get your reaction and what the impact is, if there is any here, in terms of at  least those moves that they've  made thus far? >> so it was a good start, but  as you alluded to earlier, the  housing situation, the overhang, you can do only so much with  monetary policy. but to the extent that it  incrementally improves the  psychology that's good, and for  u.s. assets, it's a mixed  picture but on balance good  because essentially what it does is, it sort of cushions the idea that china was going to drag us  into a global growth slowdown  type abyss on the one hand. on the other hand, there's this  idea with china stimulating,  yields are going to go up and  it's no surprise at all that  yields have been grinding higher consistently since the fed cut  rates because you backstop  growth, you basically put a  floor under how much inflation  can go down now, with china  doing what it's doing. but on balance, it really is a  positive medium term for risk  assets.  >> is that why your target is  higher than other people's on  the street? bob joined us last hour showing  everybody is behind the curve on their s&p price targets. we haven't reached yours yet.  >> no. we still have a ways to go, and  look, it's one of those really  challenging years. i want to go back to both jamie  dimon's comments and the  consumer confidence numbers. essentially, when you take them  both together, they keep the  wall of worry built. we would be more concerned if we started hearing everything is  great, everything is roses.  >> it is consensus, though, that we're not going to have  recession, isn't it? >> it is definitely consensus.  >> doesn't that worry you.  >> >> it does.<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Fuller: This could have a catastrophic impact on supply chains before the holidays<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> the auto and aerospace  industries. let's talk about this with craig fuller. craig, good morning. >> good morning, frank. thanks for having me.  >> craig, you have a lot of  customers with insight in the  supply chain. where do you sit on the strike  potentially happening? the increasingly likelihood, but short two or three weeks. >> that's the big question. we are certainly increasing the  view this is a likelihood  strike. a couple of months ago, we  thought it would be unlikely. there wouldn't be a white house  intervention. it appears the white house has  said they are not going to  intervene in the strike and  asked for a cooling off period  which we really didn't expect. we thought with an election  season upon us and the election  a month out, that the white  house would intervene, but that  isn't the case.  >> you see the white house may  or may not intervene. they would like to work with  federal mediators. in your mind, let's say the  biden administration gets  involved in the talks. is there any chance of using  legislation at their disposal  that hasn't been used in years? do you see anything like that on the horizon? >> they have the ability to ask  for a cooling off period of 60  days which would put us off  until after the election. that is the case the biden  administration would take. the recent reports have been  linked to the press suggest that the biden administration is not  going to intervene. they're really in a no-win  situation if they allow this to  pay place, this could have a  catastrophic impact to supply  chains before the holidays. a lot of product that moves  through containers are  consumer-related goods. this is peak season before the  holidays. you think the biden  administration would not want  headlines about a supply chain  crisis right before christmas. that appears to be the case. so, if they do intervene, you  potentially unset the unions and union members and not just the  ila, but other union members  across the country which would  have a bigger impact at the  polls. no-win situation for the  administration, but consumers  and businesses, this could have  catastrophic impact to the  economy that will be felt for  months if not longer.  >> let's switch gears from the  political sdptuff. i want to move to your  wheelhouse. many customers are starting to  move imports to the west coast. however, these are often  contract customers. they say if you want to move to  the west coast, they will charge them double. although customers on the east  coast will charge double over to move to the west coast. are you seeing similar things  how does that impact the  retailers to bring inventory in? >> the ship lines have put  substantial surcharges headed to the east coast. we have seen situation where is  ship lines have stopped taking  inbound freight for export that  goes through these ports. we are seeing, at least, the  large ship lines go ahead and  prepare for significant  slowdowns or stoppages. that is impacting supply chains. this is -- strikes are not  unconnected events or labor  issues are not unexpected  events. it continues to be impacted by  the threat of strikes. there's a lot of noise heading  into the strikes. shippers are prepared to do  that. one thing is the west coast  ports have a new contract they  were able to get about two years ago. they are performing. supply chain managers have  options. this is not a black swan event  that is expected. they have been taking  preparations. what is happening is the  unexpected and because there's  so many different dependencies  in the supply chains and  parties, inevitably when you  pl<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> President Biden delivers remarks at the United Nations General Assembly — 09/24/2024<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> the assembly will hear an address by his excellency joseph r biden jr president of the united states of america i request protocol to escort his excellency and invite him to address the assembly for my back my fellow leaders today is the fourth time i've had the great honor of speaking to this assembly as president of the united states it'll be my last i've seen a remarkable sweep of history i was first elected office in the united states of america as us senator in 1972 now i know i look like i'm only 40 i know that i was 29 years old back then we were living through an inflection point a moment of tension and uncertainty the world was divided by the cold war middle east was headed toward war america was at war in vietnam at that point the longest war in america's history our country is divided and angry and there were questions about our stain power and our future but even then i entered public life not out of despair but out of optimism united states and the world got through that moment wasn't easy or simple without significant setbacks but we go on to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons throughout through arms control and then go on on to bring the cold war itself to an end israel and egypt went to war but then forged a historic peace we ended the war in vietnam the last year in illinois i was met with the vietnamese leadership we elevated our partnership to the highest level it's a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the capacity for reconciliation that today the united states and vietnam are partners and friends and it's proof even from the horrors of war there's a way forward things can get better we should never forget that i've seen that throughout my career in the 1980s i spoke out against a partite in south africa and then i watched the racist regime fall in the 1990s i work to hold movich accountable for war crimes he was held accountable at home i wrote and pass the violence against women act to end the scourge of violence against women and girls not only in america but across the world as many of you have as well but we have so much more to do especially against rape and sexual violence as weapons of war and terror we were attacked in 911 by al-qaeda and osama bin laden we brought him justice then i came to the presidency at another moment in the crisis and uncertainty i believed america had to look forward new challenges new threats new opportunities were in front of us we need to put ourselves in a position to see the threats to deal with the challenges and to seize the opportunities as well we need to end the era of war that began on 911 as vice president to president obama he asked me to work to wind down the military operations in iraq and we did painful as it was when i came to office as president afghanistan to replace vietnam as america's longest war i was determined to end it and i did was a hard decision but the right decision four american presidents had faced that decision but i was determined not to leave it to the 5ifth was the decision accompanied by tragedy 13 brave americans lost their lives along with hundreds of afghans in a suicide bomb i think those lost lives i think them every day i think of all the 2,461 us military deaths over a long 20 years of that war 2,744 american servicemen's wounded in action i think of their service their sacrifice and their heroism i know other countries lost their own men and women fighting alongside us we honor their sacrifices as well to face the future i was also determined to rebuild my country's alliances and partnerships to a level not previously seen we did we did just that from traditional treaty alliances to new partnerships like the quad with the united states japan australia and india i know i know many look at the world today and see difficulties and react with despair but i do not i won't as leaders we don't have the luxury i recognize the challenges to ukraine to gaza to sudan and beyond war hunger terrorism brutality record displacement of people the climate crisis democracy at risk strang in our societies the promise of artificial intelligence and a significant risk well this goes on but maybe because all i've seen and all we have done together over the decades i have hope i know there is a way forward in 1919 the irish pope william butler describ the world and i quote where things fall apart the center cannot hold m anarchy is loosed upon the world end of quote some may say those words describ the world not just in 1919 but in 2024 and i see cr a critical distinction in our time the center has held leaders of people from every region and across the political spectrum have stood together turned the page we turned the page in the worst pandemic in the century we made sure co no longer controls our lives we defended the un charter ure the survival of ukraine as a free nation my country made the largest investment in climate clean energy ever anywhere in history there'll always be forces to pull our countries apart and the world apart aggression extremism chaos and cynicism desire to retreat from the world and go alone our task our test is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger than those are pulling us apart that the principles of partnership that we came here each year to uphold can withstand the challenges that the center holds once again my fellow leaders i truly believe we're at another inflection point world history for the choices we make today will determine our future for decades to come will we stand behind the principles unit us we stand firm against aggression we will we end the conflicts that are raging today we take on global challenges like climate change hunger and disease but we plan now for the opportunities and risk of a revolutionary new technologies i want to talk today about each of these decisions and the actions in my view we must take to start each of us in this body has made a commitment to the principles of the un charter to stand up against aggression when russia invaded ukraine we could have stood by merely protested but vice president harris and i understood that that was an assault on everything this institution supposed to stand for and so my direction america stepped into the breach providing massive security and economic and humanitarian assistance our nato allies and partners and 50 plus nations stood up as well but most importantly the ukrainian people stood up i ask the people of this chamber to stand up for them the good news is putin's war has failed and his at his core aim he set out to destroy ukraine but ukraine is still free he set out to weaken nato but nato is bigger stronger more united than ever before with two new members finland and sweden but we cannot let up the world now has another choice to make will we sustain our support to help ukraine win this war and preserve its freedom or walk away let aggression be renewed and a nation be destroyed i know my answer we cannot grow weary we cannot look away and we will not let up our support for ukraine not to ukraine wins a just end durable peace the un [applause] char we also need uphold our principles as we seek to responsibly manage the competition with china so it does not veer into conflict we stand ready to cooperate on urgent challenges for the good of our people and the people everywhere we recently resumed cooperation with china to stop the flow of deadly synthetic narcotics i appreciate the collaboration it matters for the people of my country me many others around the world a matters of conviction the united states is unabashed pushing back against unfair economic competition against military coercion of other nations and in the south china sea and maintaining peace and stability across the taiwan straits and protecting our most advanced technologies so they cannot be used against us or any of our partners at the same time we're going to continue to strengthen our network of alliances and partnerships across the indo pacific these partnerships are not against any nation they are building blocks for a free open secure and peaceful indo pacific we're also working to bring greater measure of peace and stability in the middle east the world must not lch from the horrors of october 7th any country any country would have the right and responsibility to ensure that such an attack can never happen again thousands of armed and mos terrorists invaded a sovereign state slaughtering and massacring more than 12200 people including 46 americans in their homes and at a music festival despic despicable acts of sexual violence 250 innocents taken hostage i've met with the families of those hostages i've grieved with them they're going through hell innocent civilians in gaza are also going through hell thousands and thousands kills including aid workers too many families just located crowding in the tents facing a dire humanitarian situation they never not asked for this war that hamas started i put forward with cutter and egypt to cease fire and hostage deal it's been endorsed by the un security council now is the time for the parties to finalize his terms bring the hostages home in secure security for israel and gaza free of h hamas script ease the suffering in gaza and end this war october 7th since october seven we've also been determined to prevent a wider war than eng gul the entire region hasah unprovoked durin the october 7th attack launching rockets in israel almost a year later too many on each side of the israeli lebanon border remain displaced fullscale war is not in anyone's interest even if situation has escalated a diplomatic solution is still possible in fact it remains the only path to lasting security to allow the residents from both countries to return to their homes and the border safely and that's what working that's what we're working tirelessly to achieve as we look ahead must also address the rise of violence against innocent palestinians on the west bank and set the conditions for a better future including a two-state solution where the world where israel enjoys security and peace full recognition and normalize relations with all its neighbors where palestinians live in security dignity and self-determination in a state of their [applause] own progress toward peace will put us in a stronger position to do with the ongoing threat posed by iran together we must deny oxygen to ter to its terrorist proxies which have caus for more october 7th and ensure that iran will never ever obtain a nuclear weapon gaza is not the only conflict that deserves our outrage in sudan a bloody civil war unleash one of the world's worst humanitarian crisis 8 million 8 million on the brink of famine hundreds of thousands already there atro are for and elsewhere the united states has led the world and providing humanitarian aid to sudan and with our partners who've led diplomatic talks to try to silence the guns and avort and avert a wider famine the world needs to stop arming the generals to speak with one voice and tell them stop tearing your country apart stop blocking aid to the sudanese people end this war now a people need more than the absence of war they need a chance chance to live in dignity they need to be protected from the ravages of climate change hunger and disease our administration has has invested over $ 150 billion doll to make progress and other sustainable development goals it includes 20 billion for food security over 50 billion for global health we mobilized billions more in private sector investment we've taken the most ambitious climate action in history we've moved to rejoin the paris agreement on day one today my country is finally on track to cut emissions in half by 2030 on track to honor my pledge to quadruple climate financing to developing nations with 11 billion doll thus far this year we've reached join the world health organization donated 700 million doses of covid vaccine to 117 countries we must now move quickly to face empo outbreak in africa we're prepared to commit $500 million to help african countries prevent and respond to empo and to donate 1 million doses of empo vaccine now we call on our partner ers to match our pledge and make this a billion dollar commitment to the people of africa beyond the core necessities of food and health the united states the g7 and our partners have embarked on an ambitious initiative to mobilize and deliver significant finance to the developing world we're working to help countries build out their infrastructure to clean energy transition to the digital transformation to lay new economic foundations for a prosperous future it's called the partnership for global infrastructure and investment we've already started to see the fruits of this emerge in southern africa and southeast asia and in the americans we have to keep it going i want to get things done together in order to do that we must build a stronger more effective and more inclusive united nations the un needs to adapt and bring new voices and new perspectives that's why we support re forming and expanding the membership of the un security council my un ambassador just laid out our detail vision to reflect today's world not yesterday's it's time to move forward the security council like the un itself needs to go back to the job of making peace a brokering deals to end wars and suffering [music] and to stop the spread of the most dangerous weapons of stabilizing trouble regions in east africa from east africa to haiti to kenya leed mission that's working alongside the asian people to turn the tide we're also have a responsibility to prepare our citizens for the future we'll see more technological change i argue in the next 2 to 10 years we have in the last 50 years artifice intelligence is going to change our ways of life our ways of work and our ways of war could usher in scientific progress that a pce never seen before and much of it could make our lives better but ai also brings profound risks from deep fakes to disinformation to novel pathogens to bioweapons we've worked at home and abroad to define the new norms and standards this year we achieved the first ever general assembly resolution on ai to start developing global rules global rules of the road we also announced a declaration of on the responsib responsible use of ai joined by 60 countries in this chamber but let's be honest this just a tip of the iceburg what we need to do to manage this new technology nothing is certain about how ai will evow or how it will be deployed no one knows all the answers my fellow leaders this with humility i offer two questions first how do we as an international community govern ai as countries and companies race to uncertain frontiers we need an equally urgent effort to ensure ai safety security and trustworthiness as ai grows more powerful it must grow also must grow more responsive to our collective needs and values benefits of all must be shared equitably should be harnessed to a narrow not deepen digital divides second will we ensure that ai supports rather than undermines the core principles that human life has value and all humans deserve dignity we must make certain that the awesome capabilities of ai will be used to uplift and empower everyday people not to give dictators more powerful shackles on human and the human spirit and the years ahead there may be they may be may well be no greater test of our leadership than how we deal with ai let me close with this even as we navigate so much change one thing must not change we must never forget who we're here to represent we the people these are the first words of our constitution the very id of america they inspired the opening words of the un charter i made the preservation of democracy the central cause of my presidency this summer i faced a decision whether to seek a second term as president was a difficult decision being president has been the honor of my life there's so much more i want to get done done as much as i love the job i love my country more i decided after 50 years of public service it's time for a new generation of leadership to take my nation forward my fellow leaders let us never forget some things are more important than staying in power it's your people [applause] [music] it's your people that matter the most never forget we are here to serve the people not the other way around because the fut we the future will be won by those who unleash the full potential of their people to breathe free to think freely to innovate to educate to live and love openly without fear that's the sole democracy it does not belong to any one country i've seen it all around the world and the brave men and women who entered a partite brought down the berlin wall fight today for freedom and justice and dignity we saw it that universal yearning for rights and freedom in venezuela where millions cast their vote for change that hadn't been recognized but it can't be denied the world knows the truth we saw in uganda lbg activists demanding safety and recognition of their common humanity we seeing citizens across the world peacefully choosing their future from ghana to india to south korea nations representing one quarter of humanity who will hold elections this year alone it's remarkable the power of we the people that makes me more optimistic about the future than i've ever been since i was first elected to the united states senate in 1972 every age faces challenges i saw it as a young man i see it today but we are stronger than we think we're stronger together than alone and what the people call impossible it's just an illusion nelsa mandela taught us and i quote it always seems impossible until it's done it always seems impossible until it's done my fellow leaders there is nothing that's beyond our capacity if we work together let's work together god bless you all and may god protect all those who seek peace thank you [music] [applause] [music]<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Energy Secretary Granholm: There's been $500B worth of investment in clean energy since IRA passage<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> nobody better to discuss all of  this than the energy secretary  of the united states jennifer  granholm who joins us first on  cnbc at post nine. madam secretary, nice to see  you.  >> thanks so much for having me. >> just in terms of news of day  on oil prices, china in there a  little bit, it's been weak  demand and then the middle east  as tensions escalate between  israel and hezbollah, i wonder  what you think the scope is for  a wider regional escalation that could potentially involve more  directly iran the big producer.  >> everybody is watching this  and seated at the end of their  chairs for a variety of reasons, not just because of oil prices,  of course. but, you know, it's one of the  reasons why honestly being  energy secretary at this time  has been so rewarding, is  because we have really been  investing and seen record  amounts of oil production,  record amounts of gas production and record amounts of renewables generated on the grid, like  unbelievable amounts. we had 30 hoover dams worth of  clean power added to the grid  this year. we are having -- that's a huge  amount of added power, clean  power, so it's really --  >> inflation reduction act.  >> yes. because the united states has  become irresistible for  developers of clean energy  generation, but also for  manufacturers of the products  that get us there, whether it's  evs or batteries or solar  panels. since the passage of the  inflation reduction act, policy  actually works, we've had over  800 factories announce that they are coming to the u.s. or  expanding in the u.s. because of the public-private partnership  that has been created as a  result of the president's invest in america agenda. it's so great. so exciting because that means  400,000 more people are working  in this clean energy space,  which is record amounts. it's really an amazing time.  >> i wonder how much is at risk  as -- if donald trump becomes  president and has threatened to  roll some of it back to help pay down the deficit and pay for  some of his other initiatives.  >> here's the thing is that, in  fact, just this past week there  were 18 republicans who signed  on to a letter saying, please  don't roll this back, because  we're seeing the benefits in our states. 86% of the investment. so there has been half a  trillion dollars worth of  investment in this clean energy  space since the passage of the  inflation reduction act. half a trillion dollars. of that, $1 for public money, $6 of private money. that's a 71% increase over the  two years prior. that money, that investment,  those jobs, are going, 86%, to  communities that have below  college graduation rates or  weekly nyse. a lot of it is in rural  communities. 60 to 70% is in red counties. it would be political  malpractice to undo what is  being done and happening and  people being hired in these  communities.  >> at the same time we've been  trying to, obviously, replace  typical energy sources with  renewables, we now have this  incredible potential uptick in  the need for power because of  data centers and the growth of  generative ai. how do you see it playing out? i mean, we talk a lot about  nuclear power. we were talking about three mile island coming back online, or  one of the reactors and any  number of other nuclear sites as well being recommissioned, so to speak. how is it going to mix out,  given our power needs could be  20%-hour than right now in a  handful of years? >> the estimates are 15% higher  within ten years as a result  both of ai as well as all this  new manufacturing activity as  well as electrifying the  transportation sector. we are going to need more power. i'm telling you, we are adding  that power. we're adding record amounts of  clean power. in addition, the hyper scalers  for these big data centers they  all have commitments to clean  energy, too, and they don't want to see themselves located in a  community where their demand for power causes everybody else's  rates to go up. they're committed, telling us,  to bringing that power with  them, which is why the need for  nuclear small modular react  tors, colocating data centers  with small reactors or the  partnerships, for example, with  constellation and microsoft for  three mile island to turn on  more power, we've got a ton of  nuclear sites in this country  that have been permitted for  additional reactors that could  be powering data centers as  well, we're working with tho<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> September consumer confidence falls the most in three years<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> a inflation in the week.  >> rick santelli has it for us. rick? >> yeah. we are looking at big misses  here on consumer confidence. we're expecting a headline  number to be around 104. 98.7. that is the weakest going back  to february of '21. i'm sorry, july of. july of '22 when it was 92.3. these are weaker than expected  numbers. towards present situation. 124.3, also a very big miss. that's the weakest since march  of '21. something very fascinating if  you look at the july read, that  was the weakest since april of  '21. so we are really looking at  present situation deterioration  and if we look at what lies ahead in the form of  expectations, minus -- excuse  me, 81.7. 81.7. that's the weakest, well, just  since july of this year. now let's switch gears towards  richmond fed. we have manufacturing and  service indices. on the manufacturing minus 21,  which pemeans it's the 11th  consecutive negative number in a row. something fascinating, if we  look at the business side the  service sector, it's minus 3. our last look at minus 13, well  it was the 30th negative number  in a row so minus 3 is  definitely a big improvement,  but it's still 31 negatives in a row. 31 negatives in a row on service sector with respect to richmond  fed. so we are looking at yields  moving a bit lower on the long  end and keep in mind the long  end is on pace for its fourth  consecutive higher yield close <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Billionaire investor John Paulson: Trump's tariff plans are 'well-founded'<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> box." our next guest is billionaire  hedge fund titan john paulson. he joins us in his first "squawk box" appearance ever. john is the president and  founder of paulson companies and an adviser to former president  trump's presidential campaign. and we're thrilled to have you  on the broadcast this morning. thanks for joining us, john. >> hey, good morning. glad to be ere. >> there's about a million  things tube, including the  markets and the fed, but i want  to start with this election. and i actually want to start  with a headline that was made  just yesterday by former  president trump, because i think we're all trying to understand  his plans as they relate to  tariffs. i'm sure you saw that one of the things that he said was that he  plans to put a 200% tariff on  john deere tractors if, in fact, they were to move them and  manufacture them in mexico as  opposed to here in the u.s. obviously, he has a broader plan around tariffs, as well. what do you make around -- about this tariff plan? a lot of economists have  questioned the level of tariffs  that he would put on. i would also say, other business executives have. and i would say just yesterday,  mark cuban in reaction to all of this, said that he said thought  that the plan was insane, and a  good way to destroy a legendary  american company. so, as an investor, and somebody who's on trump's side, what do  you think of this? >> yeah, i think trump's tariff  plans are well founded. when you look at the economists, they like the concept of free  trade. but we don't live in a free  trade world. the u.s. has minimal barriers to import into the u.s., but we  face substantial, both  financial, tariff, and  non-tariff barriers when we try  to export. so as a result, in 2022, we did  $1.2 trillion merchandise trade  deficit. we've lost thousands of  factories, millions of jobs to  foreigners because of the unfair trade competition. so what trump wants to do is  create an american manufacturing powerhouse. and using tariffs as a way to  level the playing field. so in the case of deere, we've  seen -- we now have a  merchandise trade deficit of  $150 billion, with mexico. many u.s. factories are closing  u.s. plants, relocating to  mexico, taking advantage of the  cheap labor, and importing the  goods duty-free back in the u.s. what does that do for america? so by putting tariffs -- using  tariffs strategically, we can  strengthen american  manufacturing and increase realm wages for american workers. >> but what do you think of  deere's, for example, comment  last night, which was to point  people to the idea that there  are certain types of  manufacturing that they believe  may have even lower value add,  and that they want to sort of  move up the chain. they want that to happen in the  united states. they believe that the other  manufacturing should happen  elsewhere. and that it would hurt  ultimately, the company if they  weren't able to do it this way. >> well, when you look at  overall, the policies, what you  see is a haollowed out american  manufacturing base. and we need to protect american  jobs and protect american  manufacturing. so the policies we have now are  not leading to that outcome. we can't have american producers close american factories and  offshoring. july had another record  merchandise trade deficit. so trump's plan is to bring jobs back to america, bring  manufacturing back to america,  create incentives to produce in  america, and that will result in more jobs and higher wages for  americans. >> and you don't think it turned into a tariff war? i ask, because we've got e-mails from viewers. some farmers in the midwest who  have said, look, what they worry about is actually that other  countries are going to say,  well, we don't want your  exports, or we're going to  tariff your exports. it so creates this sort of a  race either to the bottom or to  the top, in terms of cost. >> yeah, that's the problem we  have now. they've put in tariffs and  non-tariff barriers for us. and we've done nothing about it. it's a one-way street. and we have to make it a two-way street. and we have to protect american  manufacturers, the same way  foreigners are protecting their  domestic markets. >> we've also talked a lot about taxes on this broadcast,  including not taxing tips. and we've had a number of  interesting conversations with  folks around the table. and i'm curious where you land  on that. and one of the things that  people say is, you know, what  about a teacher or a nurse or  somebody who is not paid an  extraordinary amount of money,  but does not get their pay in  the form of tips. and yet, a waiter or a taxi  driver or somebody else who  would be getting their income in the form of tips, maybe the  exact same amount of money,  would not be taxed in the same  way. >> yeah, i think the trump  overall tax plan is to extend  the very successful tax cuts he  implemented in 2017 and to make  them permanent. and his tax policy reduced taxes for all americans, and he wants  to continue with that policy. the proposals that he made today protect those that are having  the most trouble meeting  expenses and the economy. and his proposals allow the  american workers to keep more of their hard-earned earnings. to give an example. under trump, real wages grew  7.7%. under biden, they've declined  2.1%. so the american worker is the  most vulnerable. so the tax policies that he  arcticlated, no tax on tips, n<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> scheduled to testify later this  morning in front of the house  financial services committee. on the agenda could be  everything from crypto  regulation to climate  disclosures. joining us now, republican  congressman, patrick mchenry of  north carolina. he's a chairman of the financial services committee. and where do you want it to go  today, mr. chairman? >> well, the purpose of the  hearing is to show what a  post-genzler regime can look at  the exchange and securities  commission. and this is certainly the  buildup of four years of  mismanagement at the rogue  agency, or active bad management at this rogue agency. what we want to do is to provide a clear idea of what it should  look like, with a balance more  towards capital formation than  taking ad hoc action to sue, to  sue people, and to make  headlines. was to actually provide some  level of clarity for investors. that's what we want in a  post-genzler regime. and that's what we hope to  highlight in today's hearing. >> when is there going to be a  post-genzler regime? >> we're going to find that out. we've got two presidential  candidates. and we want to hear from them on these issues of capital  formation, both for crypto, for  market certainty. we don't know the harris  approach. it could be the biden approach,  since she is the vice president  in this administration. we know the trump approach with  the clayton regime was a very  solid one at the s.e.c. and markets flourished. so we want to hear from the  candidates on -- for their  perspective on what the s.e.c.  should be. and we have yet to hear that  from the harris campaign. >> well, it sounds like it could be a contentious hearing, and it certainly -- this is from your  side of the aisle, we're hearing it. i'm sure the other side of the  aisle thinks that genzler has  done a phenomenal job. >> well, not all of them. in fact, we've had bipartisan  opposition to many of his acts  as chair of the s.e.c. we had in fit '21, our market  structure bill for crypto, we  had 71 democrats vote with all  house republicans, two-thirds of the house voting in favor of  this regime, which is a lark  rebuke of his actions when it  comes to crypto. i think it will be interesting  to hear from both parties on  today's hearing. and to see how that positions. it will be contentious, because  we have the full securities and  exchange commission. this is the third time that this has happened over the last 30  years, where we've had all five  commissioners. so i think we're going to hear a divergence of opinions among  these commissioners and  hopefully one that balances  towards capital formation, not  genzler's actions. >> when i was introducing you, i said, it could range all the way to climate disclosure. what do people, what do  democrats want the s.e.c. to do  about climate, whatever that  means, climate disclosure? >> sure, what genzler proposed  was for the s.e.c. to be the  world's climate regulator. and to regulate public companies for a societal goal that should  be debated on the hills -- on  capitol hill, not for  disclosures. and since there is not a single  climate scientist or scientist  over the securities and exchange commission, they proved  themselves ill-equipped. i think what we have seen out of genzler, though, is that his  actions have left the agency  with less power rather than  more, because of the arbitrary  way that he's gone about it. climate's a great example, where the courts have rebuked the  securities and exchange  commission's approach and the  genzler approach. >> you've heard that he might -- it might be the end of the  gensler regime and could be a  new regime as treasury secretary for gary gensler. have you heard that? >> there's all sorts of rumors  about what gensler wants. that's a great parlor game here  in d.c. i think that's what a few <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Our playbook is focused on quality and higher-yielding stocks, says JPMorgan's Stephen Parker<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> environment, anyway. i think we can do without them. >> thank you, phil. >>> let's get back to the  broader markets right now. the futures this morning at this point are a little higher. we've bounced around quite a  bit. dow futures up by about 50  points. joining right now is steven  parker, he is head of  specialized strategies at  jpmorgan private bank. i've got to ask you about  comments from jamie dimon this  morning, because that's kind of  rattling around in my head. he said the bond markets are  priced for perfection. so is the stock market, at these kind of lofty levels. right at a time where we think  there's going to be a soft  landing. and that's like the  cinderella-esque view of things. are you convinced that things  are at lofty levels when you  look at the stock market? >> we do they valuations are  pretty full right now. that being said, we think that  the macro environment, we're in  an environment where growth is  still pretty good, earnings are  accelerating, inflation is  coming down, and policy is  getting easier. that should allow the corporate  sector to continue to grow. that being said, we've moderated our expectation for what equity  markets can deliver over the  next 12 months. we think there's a little bit of upside, but we've pulled a lot  of that forward. we're up over 20% so far this  year. but that doesn't mean that you  need to take any sort of  significant action to de-risk  your portfolio. we think you should at normal  levels of risk. >> what if things turn down and  the fed says, we're only going  to do 25. we're only going to do as much  as the market as anticipated. we've already started this. >> we actually think that your  view is we'll get 25 at each of  the next two meetings for the  rest of the year. we think that's a positive sign, because it indicates that the  fed doesn't see recession on the horizon. >> that's what i mean. if the economy turns weaker, is  the anticipation that the fed  will fix everything by going as  deep as it needs to? >> i think the fed will keep a  very close eye, particularly on  the labor market. that's their big priority now  that inflation has eased. and if we do start seeing a  trend where labor is beginning  to weaken meaningfully, which we haven't seen yesterday, i think  the fed would pivot. i think they will get more  aggressive. i think ultimately, you'll get  somewhere to somewhere around 3  to 3.5% on the fed funds rate. >> how pivotal is this election  in terms of what you see  happening afterwards? is there a divergence, or dho yu think this will be business as  usual no matter what the case  is? >> i think politics are  overrated in terms of their  impacts on markets and trying to make any sort of meaningful  changes to your portfolio is a  really difficult game. you have to predict who's going  to win. and you have to predict how  markets are going to react. historically, it's been more  about policy and not about  party. but stocks have gotten up in  republican scregimes, in  democratic regimes and more  importantly, it's an opportunity to stay disciplined, stick to a  plan. the biggest risk is for clients  who think about making drastic  changes to their portfolios  because of some anticipation  around the election. that historically leads to bad  outcomes. >> are you playing this in the  traditional playbook of what you would do when the fed is cutting rates? are you looking at those same  stock plays or do you think this time is different? >> we think this time is a  little bit different, mostly  because of that starting point  aren't valuations that you  mentioned. a lot of times at the beginnings of a fed easing cycle, you want  to own the more speculative  names, the companies that aren't earnings profits, the smaller  cap names. we think given where we are in  the market cycle, given where  valuations are, our playbook is <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> California AG Rob Bonta on Exxon Mobil lawsuit: They lied to the world<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> filing a lawsuit against  exxonmobil on monday alleging  the oil giant misled the public  about the recycling products. joining us, attorney general,  rob bonta. >> the state of california is  suing exxonmobil for a decade's  long campaign of deception in  which they tried to convince the world, including california,  that the recycling of plastic  products, including single use  plastics is sustainable, and  that's a lie, and 95% goes to  landfill or to the environment,  oceans, rivers or is  incinerated. the idea behind it was if the  public was convinced that the  single single-use plastic was part of  the liveable, it would drive  their --  >> i have had a hard time  getting my head around this. exxonmobil says for decades  california officials failed to  act and now seek to blame  others. instead of suing us they could  have worked with us to keep  plastic out of landfills, and  their first step would be to  look at what their counterparts  now. we're bringing real solutions,  recycling plastic waste that  couldn't be recycled by  traditional methods. i am trying to understand where  the breakdown was. you said 5% of recycled stuff  gets recycled and the rest of it winds up in other places, and  exxon says 8%, and the rest  breaks down into fuels and raw  materials they could use to  remake plastic. explain where the problem is. there has been a problem with  recycling. what did exxon do? >> it's straightforward. exxon lied. they lied to the world. they had a particular image  makeover challenge with respect  to the fact that their plastics, they wanted to sell more and  more was being found in  waterways, and they needed to  fix that. they lied and said these items  are being recycled and tried to  place the blame on the consumer, and --  >> it's not just the consumer. even if you put it in the blue  bin, there are lots of  breakdowns starting from that  moment on. if you have not washed the  plastics, they can't be  recycled, and there's a lot of  breakdowns. is it your point plastic should  not be made? >> if exxonmobil knew that they  should not have said it could  not have been recycled --  >> their plan is recycling --  >> no, it's not. it's not advanced nor recycling. it's a new version of an old  lie. i don't hear in the statement a  denial about perpetuating the  myth of recycling, and i do hear complete deflection to others. let me be clear about this. this case is to hold exxon for  their actions. they have hurt california and  californians, billions of  dollars in damage to our people, and their finger is to -- their  point is to point their finger  at california. they are heating up the plastic  waste. most of it turns into  transportation fuels that are  burned once, and it's emitted to the air --  >> that's not plastic going into landfills. if you are recycling it and  using it in other ways. is your point they shouldn't use plastic? >> they shouldn't lie. >> the department of energy says they think it's only 5% because  there's no demand for the  recycled plastic. they can produce it if there's  not demand for it and people  that want to use it, so what do  you do with that? >> they said the opposite --  >> they are being recycled. >> they are not --  >> they are pbbeing burned and t in other uses --  >> a plastic bottle goes to the  recycling system and comes back  as a plastic bottle or another  plastic product, and they don't  say it turns into jet fuel --  >> again, your point is we  should not have plastics? >> my point is exxonmobil should not lie. they should not lie so people  can make their own decisions --  >> they are not -- if your point is they are not turning it down  and it's not going into turtle's noses, but if the recycling  plant is burning it down, they  are not dumping them in  landfills. is that what you are arguing? >> let's talk about it. 99% doesn't go through advanced  recycling. it does go to landfills and  incinerators and our  environment. it's a tiny amount of what they  are doing, and they are not  actually recycling. they only turned 8% through  advanced recycling into a  recycled plastic, and they need  to add version plastic into turn it into something useful again. >> if it goes into jet fuel,  that doesn't count for anything  for you, or it does? >> in the percentages you are  provide something, that's what  we are talking. i realize you are saying 1%  this, or 90% of something, and  you are saying the 90% is  showing up in landfills or are  you saying if it shows up in jet fuel or some other kind of  recycled way you are discounting that? >> by the way, you could say,  look, i wish they could say it  was going to jet fuel instead of being recycled into bottles. >> yeah, they are lying in  different ways. they are saying 100% plastic  could be recycled, and --  >> it can be. >> it has not been. advanced recycling, their wonder recycling approach only recycles 1% of the plastic --  >> into other plastics and then  you need diversion plastics. i understand that. >> no, no, not that. of all the plastics exxon prau  tka tka  produces, only one person goes  into recycling plastic, and  advanced recycling doesn't touch that. >> advanced recycling sounds  like a better thing than --  >> turning things into jet fuel  that is emitted into the air --  >> so your point is we shouldn't have jet fuel? >> my point is you --  >> you flew here, though, right. >> we travelled. >> where is the 90 -- you are  saying the 99% is going to jet  fuel or going to the ground? >> 99% of what exxonmobil  produces in plastic is not  touched by recycling. >> either you are going to say  is jet fuel, which, by the way,  i think people would find that  acceptable if they said it that  way, and if you are saying it  ends up in landfill and that's a lie --  >> a lot of percentages. i am sorry. 95% of the 99% goes into the  landfill or incinerated --  >> so most is going into a  landfill? >> yes. >> and their reliance, most of  it turns into jet fuel. >> 95% of the plastics they  make, exxon themselves doesn't  go back in<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Dr. Scott Gottlieb on obesity drug costs: Expect to see continued price reductions<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> but maybe coming a little sooner than had been expected. most of most of those markets in china up by 14%. >> novo nordisk, the ceo, set to testify before a senate  committee about the price of  popular weight loss drugs. joining us now with more is dr.  scott gottlieb, former fda  commissioner and a cnbc  contributor. and it's good to see you,  doctor. and. we just had a previous  discussion. i'm slowly becoming just open to anything. now i'm starting to be open to  drug price controls. i don't know anymore what's  right and what's wrong. if it's -- bernie makes the  point, it costs "x," ozempic  here in the united states,  whatever it was. it was -- 1,400 or something,  supposedly. >> less than that. about 750. >> but we're saying -- you know, we want touse the highest up  with we can find to make the  argument. so, the undiscounted price is  $1,400, right? in parts of -- across the pond,  it's $90 a month. are consumers do deserve less of a disparity? i'm starting to see that. how do we do it? how do we not hurt innovation  here? who's screwing us? the pbms? the drug companies? where does it lie? >> these companies have come  down substantially, 40, 50%, and continue to fall. novo nordisk missed their  estimates last quarter because  analysts didn't anticipate the  net price productions that were  happening in the market place. i think you'll see continued  price reductions. there's no question that a lot  of these drugs cost less  overseas at the list level, but  if you look at the pricing with  all the discounts baked in, in  many cases consumers in programs like part "d" are getting a  better deal than the pricing in  europe. the european prices advertise a  list price. here, you don't see all the  rebating that's happening in the marketplace. that said, these drugs still are cheaper, at least the sem semiglutide drugs are cheaper  overseas than they are here in  the u.s. and in some countries. and that's the bugaboo right now on kmil. and this hearing that senator  sanders is having is a prelude  to these drugs being price  negotiated next year by  medicaid. remember, the semiglutide drugs, re rebelisus, and ozempic were  developed a year ago. this is to get medicaid to be  more draconian in how they  ultimately set those prices. one final point, novo got this  drug approved before the end of  the year, about seven years ago. i think many drug companies are  looking at year-end approvals  now, are going to stoart to pus  those approvals into the  subsequent year, because it buys them a whole another year from  these price controls. >> it does, and you're not  talking about patent protection. >> so they come up for price  negotiations once they've been  on the market for seven years,  so why with on the market for  seven years and one month if you can be in the market for six  years and 11 months. >> you'll see a lot of november, december, november drug  approvals get pushed into the  following year by the  drugmakers. >> how much of this is novo  nordisk is european company and  they're going to come at this a  little differently than an  american company would item.  >> i think that's some of it. lily probably has more  relationships on capitol hill to keep david ricks out of the  crosshairs here. but i think more of this is  because congress knows this drug will be subject to price  regulation, under the ira next  year. and they're trying to put some  advanced pressure on medicare to do a little bit more in terms of trying to bring that cost down. so that's what i think this is  about. >> when you see senator sanders  say that this pill costs $2 to  make, why don't you sell it for  $2, does he really believe that? do they know better? because these people lie. senator warren, when she comes  on, she talks about kroger's  profits. she knows full well that she  wasn't comparing apples and  apples. and they demagogue it. they do it on purpose. >> he my really believe that. i think most people understand  that you're pricing these drugs  to recoup the is investment and  the high cost of capital in this industry. when they say to me when i talk  to them privately is the margins are still very high. this is still a very wealthy  industry. we think you can lower the  prices, reduce the margins, and  you'll still have an incentive  to invest in r&d. if you're running a  multi-venture capital firm and  look across your portfolio, in  many cases, the returns look  better in some of the other  sectors. and that capital is very fluid  and can get allocated away very  quickly. you see what happened in med  tech. venture capital has largely  pulled out of medical device  innovation, because the returns  weren't there, the pricing was  driven down. the approvals got harder. and that capital shifted into  other markets. >> let me ask you about glp-1s  more generally, which is it's  possible that in success with  these drugs, that they're going  t actually eliminate other drugs. people will not be talking  statins the way --  >> everything. >> everything! alzheimer's drugs. >> diabetes. >> i say this because of the  cascade effect on the rest of  the pharmaceutical industry, in  terms of their profits and other component parts. the question is, how soon -- you know, how much do you think of  these drugs as super drugs? do you actually think that's  true. and what is the risk -- by the  way, a lot of people that are  watching our broadcast -- i get  e-mails all the time, should i  be taking this stuff? what's going on? is there a risk of thyroid  cancer people talk about. can you just speak more broadly  about these things? >> look, there are risks in the  labels, but these drugs have  been on the market, these  compounds have been on the  market for a very long time. this is as old as the iphone. it was first introduced when the iphone was introduced. we understand the profile very  well. at the higher doses over a  prolonged period of times, we  have less experience. those are the doses that are  being achieved to experience the weight loss. but if you're properly indicated for these drugs, if you have a  high bmi and you have other  comorbidities, these drugs are  providing a substantial benefit  in terms of cardiovascular risk  reduction. >> what about the upper east  side crowd, if you will, that if you know, if you look at the  conversation of where these  drugs are being sold, there's a  huge concentration there. and i would actually imagine the bmis on the upper east side are  actually lower than the rest of  the country. >> i think you're perhaps  overinfluenced by the microcosm  in which you're circulating. i think the excessive  utilization or the inappropriate utilization in the margin is  truly on the margin. if you look at the average bmi  when novo or lily reports of  patients who are on those drugs, it's quite high. a lot of the excessive  utilization is probably with the compounding drugs, which i have  really concerns around. i don't th<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Former Atlanta Fed Pres. Dennis Lockhart: Expect a series of 25 basis point cuts going forward<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> that may happen, and i just give it lower odds than the market  does. >> we want to bring in a  professor with georgia tech,  dennis lockhart. thank you for joining us this  morning. i think this is a situation  where a lot of us who have been  watching for a long time are  very confused about and it comes with chairman powell's  description last week at the  news conference. he talked about how great the  economy is and how strong the  jobs market is, and then the  explanation for why cutting 50  basis points at this moment. if things are great, why cut  aggressively? how much more should we expect? what is your expectation from  somebody who has been in the  room? >> i think they shifted from  fighting inflation and being a  little bit nervous about the  employment situation to really  protective mode. i think if we saw the status  quo, both growth, employment and inflation just persist for some  period of time, they would be  pretty happy with that picture. i think it was austin goolsbee  that used the word, demarcation, and this was a phase with a  different emphasis to the phase  today that is protecting what  they have got. the 50 basis point move is a  little catchup from july, jay  powell said in the press  conference that he could have  moved in july had he known the  data incoming just after the  meeting. it could be a little bit of a  catchup and a down payment for  the beginning of the protective  mode. >> jamie dimon is always pretty  caution and it's his business  line as a banker, but does he  have a point that maybe the  markets are priced to perfection and his odds of that perfection  happening are less than you see  in the markets? >> i would never totally second  guess jamie dimon because he's  very astute, but i think what he may be reflect something there  are rose-colored glasses on the  markets today, and he bought  into the idea that there could  be a soft landing. the soft landing is underway, so a fair amount of it has already  been achieved. that could set you up for  disappointment if there's a  development of one thing or  another that throws the economy  off. i think it's a -- perhaps a  judicious posture to say, look,  things look good now but could  go south for us. >> maybe that's fair. rose colored glasses could be  thinking everything is going to  be well and it could also be  thinking there's a fed put and  if things go south they could  react aggressively. what do you think will happen  the rest of this year and the  first half of next year? >> i will take the fed speak of  yesterday as a good indication,  particularly kneel kashkari's  comment of more basis point  moves, and i think there's going to be basis cut series for the  next several meetings. if you look at 2025, the median  in the dots is, i think, for  about seven total cuts from  where we are today, and that  suggests not every meeting next  year but several meetings next  year. i think that's a base case. it's always a base case. they really don't know because  it truly is meeting by meeting  and they will make a decision  based on the incoming data. but as an out look from today, i would say six or seven more cuts of 25 basis points. i don't completely dismiss the  idea that they'll go heavy in  the beginning and maybe put in  another 50 basis point move that could be very much simply the  preference of the core group  that are at the core of <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Sen. Chris Coons: VP Harris has been running on the theme of creating an opportunity economy<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> set to introduce more details of the economic agenda this week. joining us now is delaware  senator, chris coons, the  cochair of the harris for  president campaign. he's here to fill us in on the  most minute details. you are not -- maybe you are  sure but don't want to steal the thunder for the vice president. >> they are giving speeches to  fill in the detail about the  overall objective to strengthen  the economic opportunity for the middle class. as she made clear from the first sentence of the presidential  debate against donald trump,  vice president harris is  committed to helping americans  afford health care and housing. the theme she's running on is  creating an opportunity economy  and the next speech will be  about creating wealth in the  country for the middle class. >> being as close as you are to  president biden, i think you  would argue that we have had --  he's orchestrated a very good  economic rebound and good  economy. one of the things people wonder  is why is it necessary to chart  a new path forward and to turn  the page for vice president  harris? why not embrace -- i would  imagine it's because americans  recently still don't feel like  it's a great economy and they  prefer trump -- maybe it's  narrowing a little, but they  prefer trump. >> you are right, it's  narrowing, by half. part of it is americans, when  you ask the question are you  better off today than you were  four years ago, many americans  misremembering how bad the  economy was four years ago and  how strong our recovery from the pandemic has been. next year the biggest fight will be over taxes. lots of folks don't remember the details of the tax cut and job  act fight of 2017. a lot of the provisions expire  next year so early next year  congress and the president will  have to sit down and hammer out  what it's going to look like for the next five years and what are we going to do in terms of the  tax code. joe biden vowed he would not  raise taxes on anybody less than $400,000. he has kept that. and donald trump is going to  impose a tariff, a national  sales tax --  >> go back to 2017 for a second. has anybody in your camp or in  the biden camp ever thought that perhaps 2017 act is partly  responsible for the highs in the stock market and the record  corporate profits, and what the  administration brag about every  day, it occurred under the tax  regime put in place in 2017? are you sure that was not good  for the economy and needs to be  reversed? >> there's part of the balance  that i believe vice president  harris and -- the stock market  just hit an all-time high under  biden. i think it's remarkable  innovation. we need to fix the immigration  system so we continue to attract the best and brightest and  hardest working from around the  world and have a tax  environment. >> do you think the american  public voters, many of whom, by  the way, have an opportunity to  vote right now, literally --  >> yes, early voting has already started in key states. >> do you believe they deserve  to know specific details about  her economic plan? should you know what your tax  rate is going to be or at least  what she believes your tax rate  should be before you go to the  polls? should you know what the  regulatory sort of regime in her perfected world would look like? i think these are singular  important questions, and you  could say maybe you are not  supposed to know these things  and that's what people want to  understand? >> she laid out a broad vision  on what are her priorities and  the average american voters got  a look at the chaos of the  former president and a vice  president that says, to your  point, we will keep a lot of the same agendas and the first thing she came up with a proposal for  a capital gains rate and it was  lower than what president biden  was looking for. she's focusing on how do we  build more housing and removing  regulatory barriers and  incentives and how to build more middle class wealth? >> we have heard about the  capital gains, and building more housing supply and offering  $25,000 to folks who are  first-time buyers. we heard about no tax on tips. those are the five specifics  that i can give you. >> what do you know about donald trump's tax plan? >> there's maybe five or ten  other specifics most people  would want to know. >> what about salt? >> what? >> salt. >> it was an intentional slap at blue states that tend to be  high-property stakes where that  ended up last time, and i  suspect you will see a salt fix  ne<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> box." a new report out from nielsen  this morning with details on  what and where people are  watching. nielsen's ceo joining us. it's fascinating what is going  on, but give us your biggest  headline when you look at the  study and try the understand  what people really are watching  in this streaming age. >> thanks, andrew. thanks for having me. yeah, the biggest headline is we have seen in three months we  have seen three different  leaders on the maximum time  spent. this month it's nbcu. what is interesting about this  month is about how there's a  real leverage across broadcast  forums, and we are talking about broadcast and streaming. it's exciting to see across  platform as a way to engage  audiences? >> we are not just doing this  because nbc is at the top of the list. i wanted to ask you about the  nbc side, the nbcu side, how  much do you think is a function  of the olympics, for example? i want to get into youtube. i think the youtube piece of  this is fascinating and trying  to understand how much of the  youtube piece is youtube tv  versus what we might describe as classic youtube. >> a couple things. for nbcu, it was all three, it  was broadcast which was up close to 60%. it was cable also up and  streaming. peacock was up almost 40% in  august. so it was across the board, and  the olympics makes a big  difference with over 5,000 hours of content and promoted. >> if you take the olympics out, what would happen to the chart? >> i think it would still be  pretty large, and the olympics  is a big driver of what is going on, yes. >> how should we think about the youtube piece? is that youtube, just folks on  the traditional app or site, or  does that include youtube tv? >> yeah, it's very important. youtube, call it regular  youtube, is a big driver. obviously in july, which is a  big summer month, you see a lot  of kids watching youtube as they are off. july, obviously youtube was  number one and that changed  again in august. it depends on the season. it depends on what people are  doing, and most importantly it  depends on how promotion and  marketing unfolds across the  media. that's the exciting thing about  what happened in august. >> i am looking at this and  thinking, amazon is only 3.2%  lower than warner brothers and  everybody else. does that change if we go a  month out because of football  and things like that? >> yeah, absolutely. with the way sports rights have  moved into different areas, we  will see shifts on a monthly  basis that will make a big  difference. thursday night football is big  for amazon, but there's lot of  things going on with amazon as  well that will make a difference for sure. >> finally, you look at  paramount and warner brothers in there and there's talk of them  merging in the future. what is driving that and does  that change again in relation to sports as we get into the fall? >> two things. this is obviously the season  beginning across the board. it's not just on sports, but  it's across all scripted and  unscripted program, so there's a chance it will unfold over the  next few months because the  season just begun. what is interesting, even though two companies have an  opportunity for a cross  platform, so they have streaming assets and broadcast and a lot  of cable net and so there's  opportunity to figure out how to leverage cable programming and  the audiences that are different precipitation way to leverage  the nbc story, it's interesting, broadcast, 61, and for cable 50  and streaming 41, as you would  expect. it's about h<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> box." day two for the u.n. general  assembly here in new york city. traffic. that is minor compared to the  mid east violence which is at  the forefront for president  biden and other leaders like  benjamin netanyahu. we have richard haas. a senior counselor with center  view partners. we are all trying to understand  how this escalates and does it  escalate? if it does, what ultimately does it mean? >> the short answer is the  question of escalation, andrew,  is with hezbollah now. the israeli hs have come in prey hard. little unclear why they are  trying to quote/unquote defeat  hezbollah. are they trying to hit them hard to soften them up for diplomacy. >> they were trying to push them back on the back heels to get  diplomacy? >> that is the likely  expla explanation. you pound them and agree to  arrangement and move back to  lebanon and more back to  northern israel. i'm skeptical. hezbollah is so well armed that  enormous tracts of israel is  vulnerable to the weaponry.  >> the question is do these  attacks change the psychology of hezbollah? do they say we can't have this  anymore or we can't accept the  bom bombings. the other piece of it is does  the play into the humanitarian  crisis in palestinians because  you are seeing people dying and  lebanese dying and how it play  into the global consciousness,  if you will. >> in my experience in the  middle east, humiliation, which  has happened recently, and  visible public attacks do not  bring about moderation. it increases grievance no matter what the cost may be. call me skeptical there that  this is a prelude to the  breakout of peace. look, the region has multiple  fault lines. gaza continues. no one's paying attention to the west bank. we are beginning to see where 3  million palestinians live and  500,000 israelis, the  gazafication of the west bank. the challenges in the north. >> what do you mean the  gazafication? >> we are seeing the emergence  of palestinian-armed my ilmilit. the palestinian authority is  sidelines or feckless or  whatever you want and increased  confrontations. >> how long before you have  actual hot stuff coming in from  iran and iraq? not just behind the scenes. this has the potential.  >> it can start in either  direction, becky. you can see the help from the  proxies. they still have not retaliated  for the assassination at the  guest house. at some point, it could go the  other way. it is not inconceivable. if you remember al haig, when he was secretary of state, instead  of fighting the wars in el  salvador or honduras, he made an argument to go to cuba. i think what you will see are  israelis arguing let's go to the source. instead of fighting the proxies, fight iran. >> what does that do? >> that would be war. up to now, if we are talking  about gaza and hezbollah and the west bank, these are localized  terrible conflicts. if it becomes israel-iran  directly, that is a regional  wide war and that impacts what  you talk about on this program.  >> so, let me ask you this, what would you do? if you were netanyahu and you  had his ear, what would you tell him? >> well, i would tell him what i had argued with him. israel has to introduce the  component to the national  security policy. if you try to marginalize hamas, you have to introduce a  diplomatic tool. support palestinian political  process so people say put hamas' offering the dead end. here is something that won't get us everything we want, but  something.  >> what do you do with iran and  hezbollah? >> with hezbollah, again, i  would try to reach some type of  arran arrangement. if you get a cease-fire in gaza, hezbollah said that would calm  the situation in the north. the situation that needs to be  worked out is reach the  agreement and say here is our  red line and if you go beyond  it, that will cause a conflict. i would be as explicit as i  could on that.  >> is that red line waving a red flag at them? >> no, they have to stop short  of a capability. there has to be a certain  warning time between where they  are and where they could get. if they were to cross that line  and go from a near nuclear  weapons state.  >> i understand that. i'm asking if you think that  would actually change their  behavior? >> at the moment, they would  never cross the line. iranians are weary because of  the reactions. they wanted to park the nuclear  weapons to get the advantages  without the cost or risk. i would continue to try to  manage this. >> okay. last question. for those investors out there  trying to manage quote risk and  possibility of war with iran,  how would you, i hate to use the word handicap it, because i know you're a golfer -- really --  >> i have a high handicap.  >> how would you assess that  risk? >> it's growing. it's more than it was. is it the most likely thing to  happen? no, because neither side wants  it. the odds are still less than  even. you can't discount. >> less than even. 50/50? >> less than even. 50/50.  >> 40/60? >> i would say below that. 2 or 3 out of 10. andrew, last april, they had  exchanges and they managed them. that's the good thing. the bad news is they got lucky  that none of the iranian <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Don't expect the floodgates to open for rate cuts going forward: Defiance ETFs CEO Sylvia Jablonski<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> and bond spreads are very low. you know, that's goldilocks. i hope that would happy. i give it lower odds than the  market does. >> for more on the markets and a couple of stocks he is watching, let's bring in sylvia jablonski. this is the guy who managed  through the financial crisis as  well as anyone. i think he's just known to be a  good risk manager. if you're a risk manager and as  the name implies, you are always looking for risks around the  world. maybe this is his default  position and it is a little  different from yours, siysylvia. it looked to me you were saying  keep it simple. rates are coming down. it makes things cheaper. it makes people move from other  assets into stocks. there  there's a lot of money on the  sidelines. that's an easing cycle. we like stocks.  >> i like your summary of my  thoughts here. with rate cuts comes an  optimistic markets. you have a market to spend money and small caps to rally and  broadening of the market. you have investors coming off  the sidelines with risk assets. if i look at corporate america  and what has happened with  earnings with conditions  restrictive the last couple  years or so, it has been fine. earnings continue to grow. the companies are making money  and the consumer holds up and  continues to spend. now when it is lighter for  corporations, it benefits the  stock market. of course, mr. dimon is, you  know, the guru here of the  financial systems. in 2001 and 2007 with the cut  this big, it was a different  situation. 2007 was the credit crisis of  the banks. we're not in that situation. we're continuing to grow and  economy is stable and rates are  coming down. keep it simple at least for now. >> you talked about how things  have done pretty well in a r restrictive environment. i guess that's where there's  wiggle room of how restrictive  it was. looking at the environment, the  resulting environment that you  described, there is no reason to think it was restrictive in  terms of equity prices and  corporate profits or gdp. there's nothing there in terms  of what we were up 500 basis  points to the 5% fed funds. there's nothing there that  points to it be restrictive. was it really restrictive and is there a reason to make it easier now? >> fair enough. what i would say is it is more  restrictive than it will be  tomorrow. so, i think, you know, if you  have --  >> it may be the wrong move. it may need to be restrictive if inflation isn't gone for good. >> well, it seems like inflation is going in the right direction. the fed always comes out and  says he is data dependent. while he front loaded this cut,  i'm sure we're looking month to  month at the numbers and  inflation data and making the  decision to cut at this pace or  slowdown. i do think there is a front load and the wait-and-see approach. i wouldn't expect this to be a  flood gates open for rate cuts  going forward. the market might expect that. they may be overzealous on what  is coming in the future. i think the fed will be patient  with this. >> does that make you selective  in what you do buy? what are you? what stocks does it make  attractive in your view? >> i like the idea of  diversifying portfolios always  and the idea as we talk about  the semiconductor stocks on dips like nvidia. palantir. it's also time to think about  the markets pulling back or  election risk or worried about,  perhaps, we aren't going to get  the soft landing. for vainve<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Zentner: If the economy does better than expected... you have to have yields come up.<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> that is goldilocks. >> joining me now is morgan  stanley chief wealth analyst. >> good morning, frank.  >> i'm not going to make a habit of paraphrasing jamie dimon. >> they're priced for the soft  landing.  >> what does it mean going  forward? it sounds if anything happens,  we could see a selloff or a dip. do you agree we need everything  to go right to keep the rally  going? >> i think that's the case. as soon as the fed starts  communicating it may start to  cut rates, the market prices in  the entire rate cutting path. in one sense, the fed needs to  deliver that. what if the fed does not deliver that? >> what do you mean? 25 basis points or if they only  do 25? >> the entire path. the fixed income market is  placing a 40% probability that  the next cut could be 50 basis  points. i don't think the fed is  particularly going to die in  battle over whether it's 25 or  50 if the data point is  weakening. in terms of the entire path  could get into the cutting  cycle, the market has priced  that in. let's say the economy does  better than expected and the fed cuts, but doesn't cut as far as  markets are pricing, you have to have yields come up to reflect  that. how does the stock market react? it is a better economy, but not  as much cutting as you assumed  in the forward looking --  >> that's interesting. we will turn back to the equity  market. you are mentioning the scenario  where bond yields go up. how does that shape your view of the bond market? >> the bond market right now is  pricing in that we get to just  above 3% by the end of next  year. it's all about a timing thing. if the fed starts with a string  of 50-basis point cuts, it's  likely they get enough lift to  the economy that you could  actually see a reacceleration of the economy as we move into the  first half of next year. the fed has cut more up front,  but may not end up cutting as  much overall. you front load the lift to the  economy.  >> does that mean you like  short-end bonds or long-end  bonds? >> you want to own more  steepening of the yield curve  there, but on a shorter time  frame.  >> okay. let's turn back to equities. we were talking earlier to  another guest. tech showing leadership. we are seeing a rally in payment stocks and financials. where are you seeing the biggest opportunity going forward with  the idea we will get more cuts? >> if we are going to get more  cuts, again, it's about a timing thing. what typically happens when the  fed is cutting? you typically have a lift to  cyclicals. we had some cyclical response. we have seen spending on durable goods items with the interest  rates coming down. we are having some response in  housing activity, although muted with the lock-in effect. cyclicals have a tough time with the fed cuts and they start to  pick up.  >> your pick for us is  alternative asset management  with kkr. quickly, elevator pitch. why <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Nadji: Prices are down anyway from 20% to 35% depending on the property type<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> financing firm marcus, the  number of distressed loans is  elevated. falling rates could help. for more on this, let's bring in president and ceo. the data from marcus and look  who is here. you always give us insight in  the commercial real estate  market.  >> thank you, frank.  >> your data says a lot of these borrowers are expecting to get  relief. i'm looking at articles in the  journal and other articles. about $2.2 trillion of loans  coming due in 2027. a lot of people are saying the  rate cuts are coming too late. what do you see that's  different? >> the constructive part of the  rate cut will spur activity. the market is resetting prices. prices are down anyway from 20%  to 35% depending on the property type. office buildings, of course,  have taken the biggest hit on  valuations. as these prices have  recalibrated according to the  free market, the leower interes  rates allows you to do loans  again. that flow of capital disrupted  two years ago will help the  market more than anything else. as far as the lenders are  concerned, it is not in their  best interest to mark-to-market  today to sell to the maturing  loans except obsolete office  buildings. th they are making decisions on  what to fire sale and not fire  sale.  >> cre loans in foreclosure  tripli tripling. how does one 50-basis point cut  stop that trend? >> it is not the magic wand of  solving this problem. it is two or three years of  patience by lenders giving the  market time to recalibrate. this is what we saw in '08 and  '09. the avalanche of under  performing properties is higher  than today. we didn't see the similar  situation that we had seen in  the early '90s with an entire  organization created by the  government, rtc, to fire sale. that has not been repeated and i don't think it will ever be  repeated.  >> you admit we're in a downward snowball. it is not as bad as it could  have been.  >> this is a beginning of a  trend. >> that's not going to stop some of the people who are under  pressure right now with loans  coming up i just mentioned at  $2.2 trillion. you mentioned obsolete or urban  buildings in that case. older multifamilies. i want to move on to other data  looking forward. we were just showing it. cre lending to increase year  over year. this year, $539 billion. next year, 665 billion. what's the cat lusalyst for the  jump? >> they were waiting for the  down turn and couldn't get fair  market value. valuations have been healthy  because the economy has done  well. you have to remember our  business has been tied to job  creation. job growth has been strong. as it slows, it is expected to  remain positive. put on top of that, the new  construction starts in every  property type have pulled back  significantly, including  multifamily. we saw a record amount of new  properties and units delivered  in 2024 and pulled back 20% and  40%. the supply side is adjusting and demand looks good. capital markets are normalizing  and record capital on the  sideline, you were talking about sideline on the previous  segment, that is coming back  into the market.  >> we have to go. is it coming into industrial or  multifamily? where does the money go? >> shopping cent<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Chaudhry: I think unless economic activity slows down significantly, we will be at 25.<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> of a 50-basis point cut and a  49% chance of a 25-point move. we have our guest with us. great to have you back.  >> thank you. >> you were laughing at 50/50. what do you think? 50? 25? does it matter? is it the cycle or the size of  the cut? >> i think they were behind the  curve and wanted to catch up. they did the jumbo cut. the dots are not matching up  with another 50. he said 50 is not the new  normal. i think unless economic activity slows down significantly, we  will be at 25.  >> walk me through this. we have the record highs and  tech out performing once again. we are seeing the set up similar to the beginning of the year. is that good? >> it is good. the economy's strong. oil prices are lower. rates are going down. this is as good as it gets for  equities.  >> does that mean we can only  have volatility? do you want to get into the  market right now or we always  talk about the cash on the  side sidelines. isn't this the time to stay on  the sidelines because there has  to be a pull back? >> equities will compound the  question of are they too rich or expensive? equal weight is not expensive. japanese equities are not  expe expensive. the big-cap tech with microsoft  and amazon and others. i think the investment they are  doing with a.i. will payoff. i think we're on the right side  of the debate if you own these  companies. >> we spend a lot of time  talking about the equities. let's talk about bonds. i know it is not your  wheelhouse. what percentage should be in  bonds? we have seen yields climb a bit  and pce coming up. >> i think outside u.s. bonds  look relatively good because  deappl deflation coming out of china  and inflationary easing. fiscal trajectory remains high. both the democrats and  republicans have fiscal  expansionary policies coming  through. if they will be implemented  raior  not depends on the legislature. i think bonds are good to own  because of the deinflationary. >> you have a lot to say about  china. are we talking about corporate  bonds? what looks more attractive to  you? >> i think credit spreads are  tight. they are supposed to be tight at this stage of the cycle. >> moving on to china. this is what you are excited to  talk about. we saw the stimulus in china. it's not the bazooka. a lot of people looking for  possible stimulus when it comes  to china is there one part of  the chiends na market that look  attractive? >> china is in a recession. consumer confidence is low. there is a overpsupply of the  property. this is not going to do fiscal  stimulus to boost the overall  economy. i think tech, which are grown up and valuations low and some of  the best compani<br>
