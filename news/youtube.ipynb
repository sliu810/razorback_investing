>> good morning, joe. there are clearly headwinds,  pockets in the consumer. western manufacturers have  struggled to really scale some  of their ev problems. that puts overall pressure on  the market. what's important for tesla is  their ability to innovate, to  continue to bring down costs,  and that enables them to bring  out lower priced models as we  think about the next 12 to 24  months, which can help drive  improved demand. you take that and you couple it  with being able to deliver  driving. i think the name is attractive  at current levels.  >> the -- i didn't even realize  this, dan. this is just staggering to me. so a bright spot for tesla was  that they actually sell  regulatory credits to other  carmakers that aren't meeting  emission requirements. tt profit was 8$890 million in  the second quarter. that's more than half of the  operating income. selling emission credits to  other automakers that are  failing to meet emission  standards. >> can i ask what that means? if the trump administration  comes in and lowers those  emission standards durks that  hurt tesla's profitability then? >> i think the focus -- i think  the focus is going to be making  cars that consumers will love  and want to buy more of in the  next few years. the political backdrop, the  emissions credit, that could  change. they have a very strong balance  sheet. they generate cash flow. in some of the markets globally  they're different. drivers for demand. clearly china's a different  market even with fierce  competition. so even with the benefit from  credits, i still think the focus is on the car sales themselves,  the units, which should improve  next year in my view.  >> then we must be in the waning stages of whatever you want to  call this. right now they're making  innovative cars. they ask elon musk would you  make less expensive vehicles,  cut down on some of the -- i  don't know. extras on some of the versions,  and he didn't wasn't to do that. they got into electric vehicles. you saw profit tumble 45%. so it's all fine and good to say they're going to keep doing it,  dan, but you say we're at the  end of this, i don't know, bump  in the road for tesla or near  the end in the beginning? >> sure. we're in between two product  cycles. you have the model 3, which was  very successful. i think what you'll see over the next 12 to 24 months is a lower  cost car and also a new  platform. and so we're in between product  cycles. the key is their ability to  bring down costs. have a $20,000 plus vehicle. we're now in the 30s and above. so if you're able to bring down  costs, that can appeal to more  buyers. and clearly the range, the  technology, the features and  functionality should continue to improve. even in a 20-plus-000-dollar  car, it should be a pleasurable  experience. we'll see what we get, but i  think customers could like that, which could help drive better  growth.  >> becky makes a good point  about a change in  administration. even with a pro ev  administration, what happens  with the build-out and the  charging stations? what's going on there? you need that, in the  infrastructure you need that.  >> they're continuing build the  infrastructure. the network is incredibly  powerfulle. that's why you see others work  with tesla and they're trying to ramp their own businesses. the network is important. i do expect them to build that  out. the key is they do have the  financial flexibility to do  that. so if you have the network, you  have the cars, and you have  incremental features that can  get delivered over the coming  years, you have what i think  will be a very durable business, which can help drive the stock  over the next 1 to 2 years.  >> the reason i think it's so  interesting is elon musk is  definitely throwing his support  behind trump. the biden administration has not been very nice to elon musk. they didn't invite him to the ev meetings and that really struck  a chord with him very early on. i think the question is would  the biden administration  policies be better for tesla and his net worth and is he going  that against his support. it's totally possible? >> becky as i think about the  decade and next decade, we're  likely to have different gorging policies here in the united  states and globally, and tesla  is going to have to navigate the dynamics. elon musk will support whoever  he prefers. but for his business and the  stock price, i think what will  matter most is innovate ing and  lowering costs and tesla can  thrive here and abroad.  >> would that be enough to  compete against chinese evs, or  will there be a need for, i  don't know -- again, we're  saying if it's a trump  administration -- big tariffs on chinese vehicles or is it going  to be a bloodbath, i think he  said, in the auto market.  >> i think you could certainly  see tariffs both here and in  europe. even were there to be tariffs, i expect them to be competitive. of course, in china there will  be competition. i think they need to bring their costs down. that will enable them to compete with the chinese oem</td>\n",

why do i think that pure  conservatives do not like  tariffs? >> yeah, absolutely. well, i appreciate the chance to talk about it. so, you know, i think the  important thing about this is  you were just talking about the  business tax cuts, business  taxes are exceptionally  regressive. beyond that, it is the part of  business taxes that massively  penalize the construction of new factories and office buildings  and factory equipment. so what are we talking about  putting tariffs in or frankly as bob talked about a border  adjustment tax, a tariff like  mechanism. it is a way of closing a  loophole where right now we  actually tax domestic production of goods vastly more than  imported goods. that's exactly what the problem  is. if you produce something here,  you face higher tax rates than  if something gets imported. that's been a taxpayer subsidy  against domestic manufacturing. that's part of the story of the  last generation or so. so, what we're talking about  here is closing that loophole  and using that not just to pay  for the broad suite of all the  tax cuts but to go further to  make good on the down payment of trump's tax bill and go into  them and make full expensing  provisions for construction of  factories and office buildings,  for putting new factory  equipment into the ground so to  speak. so, you know, that's an ability  to be a force multiplier for  workers wagers to make sure you  build on the legacy of trump's  tax bill. the economy is actually larger  right now than even the best  predictions before trump's tax  bill went into effect. and that's even without  obviously predicting covid. it shows you the power of this  kind of tax cut.  >> i think now -- i think you're wrong. he just totally turned me  around. can you -- are you goin ining t  bring me all the way back, mary? >> i think he's inventing his  own economics. yes, businesses are taxed. there are a lot of tax  preferences for construction,  r&d and other things. companies operating in other  countries are also taxed. so the question is, will these  tariffs raise jobs and wages,  which people really want in this country and many people need. the answer is simply no. it is a job buster, not a job  creator. why? because many of our companies  use imported intermediates and  they will be less competitive  because they'll have to pay  more. this is an important factor and  one reason why estimates of the  trade war that we had under  former president trump show a  job loss, not a job gain. by some estimates, the u.s.  economy tshrank one percentage  points. there is lots of reasons why the competent grew. it grew under president biden. but basically looking at the  tariffs, they're a factor to  shrink the economy, not grow the economy. so i think it is one of these  cases where, you know, lower  cuts, lower -- sorry, lower  taxes, and we get more jobs, it  is, like, wow, that sounds too  good to be true and the answer  is because it is too good to be  true.  >> when the peterson institute  scored the tariffs, i guess  they're looking at the 10%  across the board and the 60% for china. basically you said it would  amount to a $1700 tax increase  for middle earners. but don't you -- shouldn't you  account for some wage benefits  and some job gains in certain  manufacturing areas that right  now are so dominated by imports? >> yes, i'm very glad that you  asked that question. first of all, yes, we look at  the $1700 tax on middle income  families. and there will be some  offsetting sort of macro  economic effects that we could  not consider in our analysis. those are being considered in  other types of analysis that are being done at universities and  think tanks as we speak. the so-called effects amount to  very small changes, most  estimates are now coming pretty  close to ours. when we talk about tariffs  creating jobs, there is -- we  have to look at the details. first of all, tariffs might  create jobs on -- for some  manufacturers who will see some  relief from foreign competition. but let's look at what we buy. most -- many of the things,  particularly on the things we  buy from asia, we do not make in the u.s. and if we put a tariff on those  goods, u.s. is not going to be  where those jobs are created. we have seen particularly during the trade war that the tariffs  of former president trump put on china was the job act for  vietnam and thailand and mexico. it was not a job act for the  u.s. and lastly, as i low-value items we don't produce in the u.s. taxing them raises their costs,  makes it harder to sell  domestically against foreign  competitors, most importantly,  they're overseas. a recipe for, really, whamming  exporters. why? one factory i talked about,  massive retaliation by other  countries against our  manufactures.  >> richard, final word.  we know that much, not much  time. a lot to cover, but what do you  think? >> definitely appreciate. the deal. bob light hhizer a terrifying  mechanism. imports, that's half the story. trading exports. u.s. is a neek counique country  terms of wealthy countries,  having taxes on exports. what this does a proper tax  treatment on find end-use  consumption goods in the u.s.  imported. the proper tax treatments, zero  taxes on domestic exported. do it that way it actually means you're not putting in new tax on industrial inputs on capital  goods. factory equipment, things like  that. you miss a lot of heavy economic effects talking about here that  are negative. you get the positive effects and doing so giving you a pay for  for allowing proper expense so  u.s. has one of the best tax  plan on the planet. a consortium trying to push for  a minimum business tax globally  by 15 frs %. we're at 21%. question don't have proper tax  provisions. look down the line, u.s. has an  uncompetitive tax system giving  us a chance to get back to that  and frankly it's workers,  lower-income american whose  benefit the most from that and  seeing lower prices, higher  wages, faster economic growth. one nor thing on that. part of that growth isn't the  dollars and</td>\n",

second ranked member in the  senate? are people not going because  netanyahu is polarizing? >> a few things i would say. first, vice president harris has known for months this date was  scheduled. leadership of congress, both  sides worked with the israeli  government. she chose, said she has a  scheduling conflict. she chose to have a scheduling  conflict and given now the  presumed nominee for party for  president you would think she  would reschedule. regardless what one thinks of  prime minister netanyahu and i  understand he's a polarizing  figure, in israel as well in the united states, but he represents a country, as i said. one of our most important allies in the world. certainly most important in the  middle east that is shattered. has been under siege since  october 7th. worst day for the jewish people, october 7th, of any day since  the holocaust are and when  presideprime minister netanyahu comes, almost every jew or american agrees  with. it's not about israel but a  civilization struggle we share a common threat, origin, catalyst  of this kwar on israel, the ira, u.s. allies and those in the  gulf need to do something about. his country is not. the idea people are making a  statement not showing up is much bigger for netanyahu. making a statement about israel  and a statement about their  attitude towards jews.  >> you don't need to be jewish  to be a zionist either. definitely do not. i'm not jewish, but i would call myself a zionist. i don't --  >> and -- and as an american,  who's focused on american  interests in the world. right? look at this on one hand the  most important ally to america  in the world and israel's on it. >> what's your grade for the  biden administration? some people say they've been  great. i think you start telling people whether they can or can't use  weapons or holding back on  weapons or saying, well, you  know, if you do this you're  fonot  going to get them. do this, you will get them. that's b.s. would you give them a b? >> early days of the war i think the biden administration was  extraordinary. deployed military assets to the  region, president biden made a  strong statement standing  shoulder-to-shoulder with  israel. traveled to israel.  >> seemed like a no-brainer. traveling was --  >> i will tell you somewhere  between late december and kind  of march, april, something  happened in the administration  where they started to turn. around march, april, the  administration did not veto that u.n. security council  resolution.  >> who is that? who decided that? >> ultimately biden. under enormous pressure from  p progressives within his own  party. senator schumer delivered a  terrible speech on the senate  floor. what it matters. widely reported heard this from  officials within the  intelligence community in israel arnold the united states. one of the two architects of  october 7th follows events in  the united states closely. he follows politics here  closely. when he sees a breach between  the u.s. government and the  israeli government, his  incentive to negotiate a deal  goes down, because he says, wait a minute. pressure's mounting on israel. not mounting on hamas. so to your point, joe when the  u.s. does things like hold back  munitions, starts to put on  conditions for the distribution  of munitions to israel, and when they see these crazy protests on student encampments on college  campuses, leaders say the u.s.  is beating up on israel,  mounting up on israel. stand back. why come to the negotiating  table? >> not just a split between the  united states and israel. it's a split within israel  itself. a lot can be placed back on  netanyahu's head.  >> netanyahu very unpopular now. not going to dispute that. think about the big, strategic  goals the israeli government has had, eliminating hamas and their capacity to the do another  october 7th, not allowing hamas  to be in the capacity to have a  base of operations and getting  the hostages back, those goals  is where most of israeli public  is.  >> and hostage families are mad  for what netanyahu has done.  >> absolutely. i speak to hostage families on  almost a weekly basis. really. sometimes more -- i'm in touch  with a lot of hostage families. what they're going through is  excruciating. every one that is extremely  frustrated with their prime  minister, with their government, with the whole security ab apparatus. i do not like for a second,  second guess their -- their, i  just can't imagine what they're  going through. when you look at public polling  and public sentiment in israel  you see two thing. it's frustration with netanyahu. then drill down on what should  the goals be of the israeli  government right now in this  wore, it's consistent with what  netanyahu's trying to pursue. i do think it's a little  paradoxical and understandable  to be frustrated. at the same time israel cannot  allow hamas to have a base of  operations to wage war against  israel.  >> a minute left. trump shared a letter he got  from mahmud abbas. and according to some does  that -- also meeting with  netanyahu. so how do you see -- would  israel be mad that he's  corresponding with hamas or is  it --  >> i mean, first of all, the  letters, basically hamas says  glad the assassin wasn't  successful, which is --  >> i don't think you'd hear that from iran. iran, damn, they missed, they'd  say, and some people in this  country.  >> it's innocuous. president trump, talk about a  polarizing figure. many can debate and disagree  about his legacy. on israel and the middle east,  recently spoke with those  leaders in the gulf states, they agree. the trump administration's  record in the middle east is  extraordinary. moving the embassy to jerusalem. recognizing sovereignty over the golan heights. again, these leaders don't get  involved in american --  >> best thing everyone's ever  said from that administration.  >> these leaders aren't inserts  themselves in american politics. a sense the legacy on trump  administration they care about  is pretty extraordinary and  they're frustrated with smthing  out of the biden administration  especially w</td>\n",

to spread the -- spread the work out to some other players? or is it about, i don't know,  the right type of cybersecurity? what should we do? >> well, yeah. certainly i always say the right type 6 cybersecurity is always  needed. ironically this time, this  outage came from the  cybersecurity company issuing  updates to its software that  cause add large outage. the real challenge i'm  highlighting here is it's not  just about market share. a really large market share. it's the crowdstrike and  especially techs have become  really large, really  interconnected. os as we crowdstrike, a  substitute which they do fail  causing widespread damages that  can put other things at risk. economic security at risk. national security at risk. it's about identifying these  companies that pose this type of risk and coming up with some  solutions to manage that risk  before we are in a real state of crisis.  >> that's what i was thinking,  jonathan.  that as bad as it was, the  silver lining could be it was a  wake-up call? that was like a test run. so now we better figure out  exactly how to make sure this  doesn't happen again? does it mean -- different  companies in just crowdstrike? i guess the point of this  segment. do we need other people  involved? >> yeah. so i think it's a silver lining, as long as we use this  opportunity and take that  wake-up call and move forward  and make progress and actually  managing and pushing policy  around the system. it's not just crowdstrike. there's dozens to hundreds of  companies who are all very  cen central in our highly connected  economy and all can pose this  type of risk. you're absolutely right, i righ, with crowdstrike, we had this  blue screen of death that many  people woke up to. that's not the worst that it  could be. so, i agree, this is -- this is  a potentially nice opportunity  to really put some focus on  this. >> jonathan, when the  cybersecurity companies go to,  you know, a fortune 500 company  and say, look, we've got this,  we've got that, is it an easy  sell, or is it part of the, you  know, does it hit margins when  they do it? everybody's spending all this  money on a.i. i guess it's going to pay off  eventually, but it seems like i  would maybe do this but with my  existing business to get it  completely hack-proof or  whatever, i would do that, but  is there a hesitancy that it  costs money and they take  shortcuts? >> yeah, i mean, with the caveat that i'm over here in research  at rand and not making those  decisions at companies. the reality is i hope that it's  not just looked at as purely a  cost, that it's not purely an  operating expense, that this is  the necessary -- this is a  necessary thing that companies  need to be doing, need to be  making sure that they're able to protect their systems and defend against cyberattacks, which  companies are facing every day. some companies, thousands of  cyberattacks, and the fact is  that relying on companies like  crowdstrike is actually a good  thing. now, i think that there should  be policies in place to make  sure that updates like this one  are rolled out -- are actually  tested before they're rolled  out. i'm not sure exactly what  happened in this case. but i think that that's a type  of thing that could make sure  that these, you know, we don't  get this type of a widespread  outage from a single update. >> is there a way to protect  against truly, like, horrific -- i mean, there was never going to be -- the financial system was  never going to collapse, it  almost did. we'll never have a global  pandemic again, and we did. you read about a pulse or let's  say a nuclear explosion in the  atmosphere above the united  states that knocks out the grid. is there anything that's  totally -- that we can totally  protect against? is there a way to do that, or is that always looming in the  future, that something like that could still be done? >> i think the biggest problem  is when these incidents catch us by surprise. so, i think -- and time and time again, we often wait until  these -- the worst happens in  order to do something. what i'm really calling for and  was calling for in this piece  was to kind of look ahead and  think about this. we may not be able to predict  that next pulse or that next  pandemic. however, i think that we can  identify the real choke points,  and at this point the  systemically important entities  that are out there and make  plans for how they're able to  manage that next shock, that  next surprise that happens,  whether it be a cyberattack or a pandemic, and make sure that  we're able to make our overall  system more resilient. one of the problems that you can see with these types of risks is that they're systemic. they aren't risks that any  single organization can manage  by themselves because they're  going to quickly spread  across -- from those  organizations across their  networks, across their company  connections, across their  products, and so it's not  something a single organization  can manage. it's not something you c</td>\n",

       "      <td>the second quarter. automotive sales dropping 7%  from last year, and adjusted  operating margin shrinking to  its lowest in three years. here to discuss is bernstein  analyst, toni sacconaghi, who  has an underperform rating on  the stock. has had that for a few years. feels like there's a disconnect  with investors zeroing in on the auto business, automotive gross  margin, and the company talking  about full self-driving and robo taxis and energy storage. what's the story here? >> good morning, sarah. look, i think the car business  is struggling for tesla. the automotive industry has  always been a cyclical,  low-margin, very competitive  business. and it's getting more  competitive. it's a global industry now, the  chinese are formidable, we have  lots of new ev start-ups, both  domestically and  internationally. and so it's a tough business,  and we're seeing that in tesla's results. automotive gross margins have  literally been cut in half in  the last nine quarter. they were 30% ex-credits in q2  '22, they were 14.6 in this  quarter. the business is very tough. and i think what tesla is  communicating to investors is,  we were going to create value  against this backdrop of a tough car business is trying to solve  full self-driving or autonomy,  and using our artificial  intelligence capabilities to  build a robot. and both of those markets could  potentially be very large and  tesla believes that it can be  first and a dominant player in  each of those markets. and that's the debate on the  stock. the car business, i think, even  bowles would say, may only be  worth 30, 50, $70 per share  under optimistic scenarios. but the question is, how do you  value price and make assumptions for these other two  opportunities? and that's really where the big  debate on wall street is today. >> but this was never valued as  a traditional auto company. tesla was never scrutinized that way. it was always about the future  and about bigger technological  ambitions, and that's and what  musk was talking about last  night. >> i think the rhetoric has  changed a little bit, because  until about a year ago, tesla  was saying it would grow units  50% per year. it would get to 20 million units over time. currently, it's going to do  about 1.7 or 1.8 million units. so growth was a very big part of tesla. and the notion was that in  addition to having very high  volumes, tesla would be able to  sell software, principally full  self-driving software at very  high margins, so it would not  only be the biggest automotive  player, but the most profitable. that notion of 50% growth, and  20 million units, at least for  now, seems off the table. tesla, you know, didn't even  reiterate last night that it was going to grow units this year at all. a major, major departure from  historically saying it was going to grow units 50% per year. >> toni, speaking of the future, you wrote back in april that you thought a robo taxi unveiling,  which we then thought would be  on august 8th, would be more  aspirational, more akin to the  semiand the roadster  announcements. did anything last night give you the impression that october will be more concrete? >> good morning, carl. i don't think so. i mean, look, we are a long ways from being able to have a robo  taxi system from tesla, because  there's a technological issue  and tesla itself has concede tad we're not quite there. i think any user who has used  full self-driving from tesla  would admit that it's fantastic  95% plus of the time. but that's not good enough. it needs to be perfect 99.999%  of the time. and tesla hasn't gotten to that  level of accuracy. it hasn't shared data with the  public, as far as we know, with  regulators to show where its  intervention levels are. and so there's a whole  technology issue, but there's  also a regulatory issue. and then there are much bigger  issues around insurance, who's  responsible for liability, how  is tesla going to monitor these. and so they're very, very big  questions. i think it's a lot easier said  than done, in terms of saying,  hey, we have a car without a  steering wheel and without  pedals. and we think in a couple of  years, we'll have this whole  fleet. but as you begin to  operationalize that, starting  with full self-driving, we're  just not there yet. i thin</td>\n",
