    "explaining Michael how's liquidity [Music] framework welcome back to the Bitcoin layer I'm Nick btia two weeks ago we had on Michael H of crossb capital now Michael broke down his views on liquidity his Outlook and a lot of individual Global macroeconomic topics including the currency War going on in Asia now you at home requested that I break down some of his analysis even more to help you guys understand some of the things that are a little bit more complicated that he might be discussing so as your teacher that is my goal today so let's get right into it okay Michael how in this episode starts with his view on liquidity utilizing his Global liquidity index now this global liquidity index is crossb capitals Holy Grail what is it and what does it consist of now we're going to be very honest with you guys we see Michael how's work that he's put in over the last several decades and we understand that his framework has a lot of Merit that's why we've had him on multiple times and that's why we try to understand his framework okay now first things first I want you you guys to go check out this book capital wors okay this is Michael how's whole framework and his thesis really and so it is important I would recommend people to go into it now as I have gone through how's book it is extremely complicated I find myself reading the same three to five pages uh maybe even a dozen times with a pen with my own notebook trying to break it down and that is me as a student trying to do my best there so today I'm going to do my best to save you the time of going through his book and just try to simplify it as much as possible okay so what is his liquidity index what does it measure the Bitcoin layer is very proud to be sponsored by river a Bitcoin only exchange and who

you might think of liquidity in terms of a a certain asset being very liquid and having a high degree of liquidity so when we think about bitcoin's liquidity we are talking about how much money can move in and out of Bitcoin without moving the price too much if it can then Bitcoin would be thought of as very liquid or have a lot of liquidity us treasuries the liquidity around us treasuries is something that's often discussed so as as one of the major asset classes across the entire Spectrum right it is the foundational interest rate within the US dollar Spectrum this US Treasury curve so there's a high degree of liquidity in the instrument especially when we get into treasury Futures but when we think about the treasury market individually each treasury security would theoretically have a different amount of liquidity why because each treasury security was issued at a different time so the treasury the 10year treasuries uh that were issued this month are a different security than the ones that were issued three months ago for example so each treasury security out there has its own liquidity challenges with the backdrop of the whole asset class having a high degree of liquidity because they are US Treasury Securities and there's a large quantity of them so liquidity for Securities and liquidity for asset classes in terms of money being able to move in and out very quickly without moving the price too much that is a definition of liquidity that you and I are all used to and when we hear the word liquidity quoted in the financial media we're actually hearing people refer to how much money is in that particular asset class and how easily it can move in and out therefore liquidity also has to do with the trading volume behind each instrument if there are a lot of Traders and if there's a lot of capital involved in a particular instrument then it would be thought to have a high degree of liquidity so now with that definition of liquidity which hopefully after hearing that explanation hopefully you guys hear that and say yes that is what I understood to be liquidity or how the financial media uses that word now I want you to throw all of that out the window for the next however many minutes this video goes and our goal here is to use liquidity on a blank slate we're going to scrap your previous understandings of the word we're going to give it a new meaning today and that's what how does in his book he goes through I understand this is how you think of liquidity but forget that let's break down this new way to think about this word and what it means to me okay we're starting with a fresh Blank Slate on the word liquidity what does this word mean Michael how takes this framework from his days at Solomon Brothers and Henry cofman Kaufman put forth this theory that what powers asset prices is the quantity of funds that flow through the system now that's this concept cept of flow of funds and quantity of funds is what they Define as liquidity so liquidity is not then how much money can go in and out of a particular asset class but it's actually how much money is there in the world that's the way that they're thinking about liquidity okay so let me let me say that again in a maybe in a different way liquidity to to Michael Hal is the sheer amount of money that has the ability to move through the system and so how can we measure the amount of money that can move through the system it really comes back to One Core metric and that is the size of the balance sheets throughout the financial system so Michael how's framework includes cross border Capital flows so that's in the name I asked him about that we'll get to that a little bit later in this video when we get to that part of the interview but let's focus on this first concept here which is the size of the balance sheets of the financial institutions throughout the system so this includes central banks and Commercial Banks and that's a very important distinction because when we hear people talk about the money supply a lot of times they're talking about the quantity of money that has been issued by the central banking system across the world and not including necessarily the commercial banking system so this concept of liquidity is pinned on the both the assets of commercial Banks and central banks notably about how's liquidity index is that it's Global so it's not just the US and the US dollar the fed and American Banks it is all banks around the world and all central banks including China now China is an enormous contributor to Global money supply and therefore Global liquidity so when you hear Global money supply and it includes central bank money and Commercial Bank money that would be a quantity of money that would be more akin to Michael house Global liquidity index now right now the index sits at somewhere around $175 trillion so you guys should know at home that what we're doing at the Bitcoin layer is while we're conducting our own research and trying to to go through house framework teach ourselves and learn what he is talking about now even though I'm trying to reverse engineer his index I haven't tried that much because admittedly there are several components to this index that just mathematically speaking I don't have down yet and so I'm trying to go one step at a time so the size of central bank balance sheets and Commercial Bank balance sheets not just the total size but the quantity of Securities that they own that can be converted instantly to cash and that is why he calls it liquidity okay so let's say that again we have an asset base across the system so imagine the FED owns treasuries right the FED owns treasuries and the commercial banking system also owns treasuries now add that up in the United States and across the rest of the world that also includes the European debt that's owned by the ECB and the European banking system so German banks owning German booms French banks owning French government bonds the ECB owning German bonss and French government bonds it includes China the People's Bank of China and the government securities that they own and the government securities that are owned by the banking system in China as well and so at its very minimum this index includes all of that Capital now note how it's not just measuring the quantity of sovereign debt in the system because a lot of that sovereign debt is owned by whom it's owned by the investing public it's not owned by the banking system that uses those bonds as collateral and that is another key uh word here in Michael how's liquidity framework you'll hear the both of us use the word collateral throughout the conversation what we are referring to are those government bonds but not all of them the ones that are owned by the banking system and that's why they are collateral because they are used by the banking system to transform that collateral into cash and that is what we call the repo market so let's pause Michael how's liquidity framework explanation for a quick explanation on the repo Market the repo Market really under pins a lot of this idea of global liquidity index being the collateral that's in the system because through the repo Market the collateral can become cash and I promise I'm going to get back to why it's called liquidity here in a few moments okay so let's first talk about the repo Market the repo Market is the transformation of collateral Into Cash that is the way to think of it if you think about a a pawn shop on the corner that will transform your gold jewelry into US doll notes Federal Reserve notes paper money okay that is transformation of collateral into cash I have gold in my hand I go to the store and I walk out with paper money I've just transformed a piece of jewelry into paper money that pawn shop is the per perfect metaphor for the repo Market okay you go to the repo market and what do you have you don't have a gold chain you have a treasury bond a treasury note a treasury bill uh a bill just means a zero coupon security that's issued with a one year or less maturity so 1 month 3 month 6month bills for example notes are the colloquial term for twos three fives sevens and 10 and then the 30-year part of the curve is called the bond and that's just a colloquial difference between the 30-year part of the curve and the front end part of the curve but the whole two through 30s and I I shouldn't uh forget the 20er part of the curve as well CU that's now back issued in it's uh issued in the treasury primary Market as well all of those from two to to 30 are semiannual coupon Securities okay so they pay twice a year the coupon and they pay par at the end of the maturity now we can take this treasury security to the repo market and transform it into cash and so that is what the repo Market is if I have a treasury bond I can take it to the repo market and the repo Market will turn that collateral and lend me essentially 97% of the value of that collateral and in this way a bank and forget the word central for a second let's just include central banks in this term banking now if a bank owns a treasury security it can very easily transform that treasury collateral into 97% cash and what can it do with that cash and this is now back to the word liquidity okay so I've given you the repo 101 it's the pawn shop for treasury bonds or treasury collateral and we are the banking system now we have the treasury collateral we own it it's our asset we can transform it into cash and then do what with it spend it that's where the word liquidity comes from because that money can be spent on what other Financial assets including corporate bonds and equities and so that is why Michael how's Global liquidity index is so well correlated with the prices of assets it's because if you think about the quantity of collateral that's owned by the banking system that collateral can directly be transformed into spendable money and that money doesn't get spent at the grocery store or at the pump it doesn't even necessarily get spent in The Sovereign oil Market okay it gets spent in the financial sphere that is why asset prices move with Michael how's Global liquidity index so it's a study that he's done based on Decades of work and Decades of empirical evidence that the quantity of collateral in the system moves the needle so it's not just the quantity of sovereign debt that's owned by the banking system that is a major major component here now we don't have the individual contributors to Michael house liquidity index and like I told you guys although we are in theory trying to reverse engineer it really all we are trying to do is learn it one component at a time and so in our conversation you'll hear me ask Michael Hal about t- Bill monetization so let's get into that portion of the conversation so let's talk about t- Bill monetization and then we'll get back to Michael how's Global liquidity index and directionally where it where it's been and where it's going and why okay but before we explain that we have to explain T bill monetization and my question about that now today I'm not going to go really deeply or much at all into the Chinese banking system and the driver of global liquidity that is new Chinese money okay China's banking system and how liquidity is created over there is way outside of my area of expertise so I'd rather take much more time getting into that trying to research it myself and explaining it and and really just asking more questions there and doing more research but I can explain to you the US side of things so that's where I that's where I will remain here today so t- bill monetization by the Commercial Banking sector what does that mean well the reason that I make the distinction with Commercial Banking is that you might be you might be familiar with QE being the purchase of Treasury Securities by the fed and the FED issues reserves to the banking system so it's an asset swap for the commercial banking system the commercial banking system loses treasuries and gains reserves but at the Central Banking level we have an expansion of the money supply because you have uh a just a digital creation of Reserve balances to purchase those treasury Securities so that's what QE is but what is t- Bill monetization by commercial Banks mechanically this is how it works the treasuries get issued at auction they end up with the buy side meaning asset managers or foreign direct buyers uh Sovereign wealth funds foreign governments foreign central banks us commercial Banks so we have some buyers there but then we have these dealers that take down inventory those dealers then will sell that inventory on to commercial Banks now I said commercial Banks already commercial Banks show up at the auction and they will swap reserves for treasuries and that is not a direct monetization because those reserves were already in the system so again that was an asset swap for the Commercial Bank but the Commercial Bank will also add treasuries after the fact in the open market and when it does that it can monetize the debt and in that way the way that that happens is that the primary dealers take down excess inventory at treasury auctions they put up that inventory for sale a Commercial Bank sees it and says okay I will take down some of that inventory and when the bank takes down that inventory it can create a deposit for the primary dealer and there for absorb the T Bill creating a deposit or even a repo liability to whoever lent the money from somewhere else in the banking system money gets created when t- bills are purchased by commercial banks in the second in the secondary market so in this way commercial Banks can expand their balance sheet add treasuries on the asset side and then add a deposit for whichever primary dealer they purchase that inventory from and it doesn't even necessarily have to be a primary dealer it can be a treasury that is elsewhere in the system that has already settled that now can be swapped out for a deposit for the seller so the seller has a treasury and now gets a deposit and the Commercial Bank absorbs a treasury and and issues a deposit and now remember when I say the word issued a deposit issued means created so that is why the commercial banking system can create money for T bills and that is what Mike how is calling monetization and let me explain something to you too people will bicker with him about why it's called why he calls it monetization and they will say it's the wrong word to call it don't call it that and they will they have bickered with him and they will continue to ignore all of it what Michael how's point is is that the the banking system expands it expands when this happens it doesn't happen for every treasury that is issued but it's happening for a lot of them and so when that action happens a commercial Bank buys a t- bill in the secondary market and creates a deposit issues a deposit what grows in size the Michael how Global liquidity index grows in size and so what what grows liquidity per his definition liquidity grows so when he talks about t Bill monetization he's talking about commercial Banks expanding their balance sheets and and thereby creating more liquidity in the system to then swap that treasury for cash to spend on financial Assets Now One More Concept before we move on here on bills themselves we talk a lot about t- bills here in this conversation why do we talk a lot about t- bills because T bills are the the plug for the federal government what do I mean by that the government can only issue x amount of long-term debt because if it issues 2x that amount it might really affect the price what does that mean the treasury right now is issuing $70 billion worth of 5year notes okay every month the treasury issued 70 billion of 5year notes it when it issues those 70 billion it is telling the market way in advance how much it is going to issue in each part of the curve now even though treasury will update its estimates every quarter for how much it's going to issue it forecasts 1 to two years out as well how much it's going to need to issue now the market understands that we are are going to see higher coupon auctions in the future meaning non bills we know we're going to see that increase but we know it's going to be slow and steady we we also know it's not going to double next month it's not going to double next quarter it's not even going to double next year but it might go up a lot but it can't go up so fast that it actually wrecks the market and that is when you might see treasury yields just go absolutely Haywire out the curve if the treasury is going to start issuing way more Supply so this is actually a concept we've talked about with a few of our guests of late it has to do with term Premia we close with this concept with Michael Hal uh in this conversation as well this is the concept of the term Premia now instead of explaining term Premia just think of it as the yield curve for a second the yield curve is the term structure of interest rate so it's the interest rate at each individual term so the 10 at the 10year term has its own interest rate the 30-year term has its own interest rate so does the three-month part of the curve or the 2-year part of the curve so when we talk about the yield curve we're picking two points on the curve and measuring the slope is the longer term higher yielding than the shorter term right now it's not the 10-year yield is lower than the 2-year yield and the reason people uh suggest for this inverted curve is that the treasury hasn't issued as many longer term Securities as they could have so they're artificially keeping the longer term Securities scarce and if there's artificial scarcity that will boost the price and remember in fixed income price is going up means yields going down so a higher price for treasury Securities means a lower yield so a lower yield in treasuries in let's say the 10 part of the curve then in the front end of the curve some people suggest that that is evidence the treasury is keeping an AR artificial scarcity on longer term issuance instead of arguing whether I agree with that or not and it it really is a it's it's both there's there's arguments on both sides and I can make a very strong argument on both sides but we'll save that for another day why the curve is inverted and whether or not there is artificial scarcity the point here is that Supply is what we can measure so if Supply will not be doubled and tripled in 5year notes and in 30-year bonds how will the treasury Department raise money for all this obscene spending fiscal deficit spending that it's doing to the tune of 1 to2 trillion per year we know that there have been 10 trillion in cumulative deficits over the last 5 years that money gets funded with t bills T bills okay the short end of the curve these shortterm instruments that's how the treasury funds the Gap in F in the deficit sorry the Gap in the budget which is the deficit so the deficit spending is done by issuing t- bills so when that's why Hal fixates on t- bills and them getting monetized because that is the plug that's where the quantity really is okay the quantity of T bills has really gone up a lot now back to why he focused so much on T bills and the question that I ask him uh that he responds to that I have my understanding of it of it correctly so why does this huge t- bill issuance affect liquidity from the one side of things it's the collateral stock so the size of collateral in the system when commercial Banks monetize these t- bills it means they're issuing fresh money to do so and in this way t- Bill issuance really grows the banking system because those same treasuries if they were longer term bonds they might not have necessarily been purchased by commercial Banks they might have gone to investors okay and if there were and the reason that investors are not taking down those T bills is it's not attractive enough for them to do so right now if the yields were higher on 10 and 30e notes and bonds maybe those investors would take down that cap uh those Securities so that's one side of it the the size of collateral in the system grows when T bills get issued but then what is what is another side of it right and then the second thing here is that you don't have the duration hit to the market what do what do we mean by that so think about what I just said about the artificial scarcity so if you have more bills you don't have more bonds and if you don't have more bonds that is what the artificial scarcity that I was talking about so again whether or not the artificial scarcity is the thing itself causing the inversion of the curve is not important the point here is that you have artificial scarcity so if you had bonds being issued instead of bills bond yields would go up and collateral prices would go down because remember in fixed income prices and yields are inverse so as yields go up prices go down so if Bonds were issued if the treasury decided we're going to issue a lot of bonds instead of bills we're going to issue a lot of bonds what does that do it said it tells investors oh we are going to demand a higher yield then we're going to demand a higher yield so the price of all the existing debt goes down what does that do to Michael how's definition of liquidity it reduces the ability for the banks to turn collateral Into Cash because the prices have gone down now they're not going down by 50% they're going down by a few percent but every little scent matters especially when we're talking about $1 trillion of collateral that is a lot of money then that can disappear from the system and that's again why liquidity when it goes down asset prices go down so when you think about yields moving markets think about Michael how's liquidity framework and the collateral component of it if treasury yields go up it means treasury prices go down if treasury prices go down the asset size of the banking system goes down the ability for the banking system to turn collateral Into Cash to buy Financial assets goes down so stock prices go down that's how it works and that's why you have to understand that yields affect asset prices across the board and of course treasury prices can go up in a risk off move as risky assets go down in price so high treasury yields can cause weak asset prices but also very weak asset prices can be caused by a weak economy which cause higher treasury prices so it's not just linear I always tell my team that I always write about this concept make sure you guys go sign up for our free research letter at the Bitcoin layer.com subscribe we write about these Concepts so that you guys understand it's not linear we can't just say a is happening so then B will happen there's many things happening all at the same time but yes collateral prices moving lower as yields go up affects Global liquidity in Michael how's index quanti quantitatively affects the index and therefore drives asset prices lower or I shouldn't say therefore I should say his historically or empirically it has lined up well with asset price declines again collateral prices are only one component of the framework we don't have the metric as to how much it is in the contribution to his index but my goal is to explain to you guys my understanding as I go and so if I can if I can well articulate this issue to you on collateral prices being one of the main components of his liquidity framework that's what we're going to start with and then who knows maybe we'll do several more episodes like this where we just keep going deeper and deeper into the concepts I can already tell you that when we get to the duration portion that is a very thick concept that probably needs a whole episode in itself and maybe even an entire interview with Michael how himself so now let's close with a couple last Concepts here we'll talk about duration and then we'll go back to the index and his outlook on duration what is duration duration is the sensitivity of an asset a fixed income asset to movements in interest rates so a if a bond has duration that means that a as interest rates change the price of that Bond will change so at as interest rates rise prices fall but they fall by more if a particular fixed income instrument has a very longterm to maturity and in that longterm to maturity you have several cash flows and many years of discounting of those cash flows so that bond has a lot of sensitivity price sensitivity to changes in interest rates as interest rates go up the price of a 30-year Bond will fall materially okay so what Michael Hal is talking about with duration is that the duration of treasuries in the system the collateral in the system itself is shortening in duration as the quantity of treasury bills increases and if the if the collateral itself had a shorter duration it means that there's less risk in the banking sector there's less price sensitivity to changes and interest rates versus if there were longer duration instruments in the banking sector and so when we think about duration being a measure of risk what we're talking about is how much A bank's balance sheet will change in value as rates go up and down and if the treasury and the US government decides to continue 1 to2 trillion in fiscal deficits every year the quantity of duration instruments will eventually have to rise and in that way I'm sure Michael how will forecast his liquidity index lower but right now he is forecasting it to go higher so what is he expecting he is expecting central bank balance sheet expansion and what he sees here is that central banks are moving to start cutting rates all around the world especially starting in Europe he sees the FED probably coming in to cut rates this year he also sees the FED moving to expand its balance sheet off of an announcement recently to shrink the size of QT that is the fed's balance sheet currently is shrinking in June it'll start shrinking by less and House's forecast and it has been ours for a while in that ample reserves framework that the fed's balance sheet will eventually have to start expanding and as it starts expanding what it does in his framework is it creates more collateral in the system that can be converted quickly to cash which can then be spent on financial instruments so it this is an intense oversimplification of what Hal represents okay he has Decades of work his book is really it's so interesting to go through how many components to this framework there are and I can't even begin to get into them in one video we'll try to have Michael how back on to explain more about his liquidity framework he also notes that Bitcoin responds really well to Global liquidity and changes in global liquidity and that is why we care about it too we see Bitcoin as a financial asset now and as a financial asset it will be the recipient of funds that are created from an increase in global liquidity so that's why Global liquidity is so important to understand for Bitcoin and when we think about bitcoin's drivers cuz right now as we sit here towards the end of May we're looking at Central Bank starting to move from tightening to easing policy and that should in theory drive this this Global liquidity stock of collateral higher in quantity and in value thanks for sticking with
