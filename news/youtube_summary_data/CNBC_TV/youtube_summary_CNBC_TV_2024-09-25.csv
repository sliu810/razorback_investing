"Retail is the next sector to benefit from AI, says Zeta Global CEO",2024-09-25 23:57:34+00:00,5,IYZsrobQbws,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYZsrobQbws,"that has a platform with over a  billion users, it's going to go  business to consumer. they have a lot of opportunities with meta a.i. we're not talking about that lam ma model, but it's open source,  and we're going to hear a lot  more about it.  >>> shares of a.i. cloud  marketing company zeta global  have soared more than 230% this  year. far outperforming darlings like  nvidia. for more on the state of a.i.  and the novel ways companies are using the technology, let's  bring in zeta global ceo david  steinberg. you founded your company before  a.i. was a buzz word. >> i joke, we founded our  company 15 years ago, we pivoted it hard into the a.i. ecosystem  seven years ago, not to be  confused with seven months ago,  where a lot of the guys have  sort of come in. >> right. so, where is your advantage in  using a.i. to sell ads and  marketing versus other companies that have sort of been newer to  the game? >> i think the difference is,  most of our competitors have  built their algorithms outside  of their platform. so, if you have a marketing  cloud, you have to step out of  the platt tomorrow to do a  query, then you have to go to a  data system, make a decision, go back there. that latency destroys return on  investment. we rearchitected our entire  platform to put data and a.i. as native to the application layer. so, we can make a decision in a  millisecond, where as our  competitors have to make a  decision in many seconds. you know, 7 to 9 seconds m and  it allows us to put more  variables in to create better  return on investment if our  enterprise clients. >> what does that mean in  dollars and cents in terms of  milliseconds versus seconds? >> yeah, so, there was an  independent study that said for  every dollar in enterprise an  agency spendings in our  platform, we return to $5 to $7  in return versus our  competitors, that are $2 to $3. >> wow. what are you seeing right now,  just in general, in the online  ad market? >> well, i think we're seeing  the advertising ecosystem grow. it should grow low double digits this year, and as we look at it, and, you know, we recently  reaffirmed -- i'm supposed to be careful here, recently  reaffirmed our guidance at this  quarter for a 35% organic growth rate, so, feeling like we're  obviously growing much faster  than the market itself. >> david, you and i met seven  years ago when you were still a  private company and you did  describe the pivot that you just mentioned heard in a.i. --  >> i believe you told me i was  crazy at the time, dan. >> i think a lot of folks  weren't really focused on it. so, now, your point is, there's  been, you know, 7 months, 17  months, there's been a sea  change. you have a murderer's row of  ceos, cmos and the like. what are they saying about the  opportunities here? because, like, are they pivoting their businesses now? >> everybody is, yeah. so, i mean, if you -- when we  look back ten years from now,  we're going to say that the  renaissance moment, dan, in  a.i., was the launch of chatgpt. not because very large  enterprises are using it yet,  but because it was the moment  that a.i. went from science  fiction to board room  conversation. and boards of directors are  going to their ceos, saying,  what's the a.i. strategy? they're going to the cxos,  saying, what's the a.i.  strategy? what we're doing tomorrow at  zeta live, we're talking about,  how do you fill fulfill on it? so, if you look at the promise  of a.i., one side of the trade  is efficiency, one side of the  trade is revenue growth. there are very few platforms  that have delivered on even the  first one, let alone both. you know, we like to say at zeta global, we're able to deliver  not just on efficiency in a  meaningful way, we literally  help our sbir prize clients  lower their cost to create and  maintain customers, by up to  50%. we're also helping them grow  faster, and at zeta live, we're  going to have a lot of peo","Category: Technology

Mad Money - 09/25/24 | Audio Only,2024-09-25 23:19:53+00:00,45,dpvdfOQiKlg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpvdfOQiKlg,"my mission is simple to make you money i'm here to level the playing field for all investors there's always a bu market somewhere and i promise to help you find it m money starts [music] now hey i'm kramer welcome to m money welcome to cr america love you my friends i'm just trying to make you little money my job is not just to entertain and educate but i want to teach you and explain and tonight i'm doing it so call me at800 743 cbc or tweet me at jim kramer we too often invest for the day i always hear people talking about what's working at the moment and in the old days when the great mares ruled the mornings around here i remember that each time i co-hosted he would introduce me as reverend jim bob from the church of what's happening now it was fun back then it seemed like everyone was running their own personal hedge fund there was an understanding that a stock could be here today and going tomorrow and everything was fine everyone was fine with it those days are over though and if you recommend a stock for a trade even if you say buy it today for the analyst meeting tomorrow and then you sell there will always be a video a youtube kicking around shows you like the stock but never gave the cell call so we've gone beyond that we're all about educating you to be a better investor the same thing we do every day at a higher intense level at the cnbc investing club that i want you to join tonight i want to introduce you to this concept that is so important and it's called suitability basically what stocks fit you what investments are right for you not for this week not for this month but for your age for your temperament i first heard of the concept of suitability when i was in training at goldman sachs for the group that helped small institutions and individuals now called private wealth management i've been buying individual stocks for myself and others for a half decade before i got to goldman in 1983 as a summer intern at the time i was watching financial news network between classes at harvard law school that was the predecessor to cnbc whenever i could i'd run over to the harvard business school library where they had all these old research reports from long gone firms like bas sherson leman about stocks totally on a catch this catch kent basis those of you who grew up with the internet have no idea how hard it was to access information in the80s if i liked a company i would have to ask the librarian for a micro of the firm's sec filings i don't do they still micr fishes these were little pieces of plastic that you stuck into a machine and you read the followings all which were usually 6 months old by the time i got them everything i did back then is online now and instant and updated the imperfections in the market back then were legion now everyone can know everything but more on that later tonight i spent all week trying to find one stock that i thought would work one stock that would be good for week where anyone who wanted to invest could take the idea and then i changed my answer machine yes my answer machine another thing we got rid of i changed the message to a 20 second wrap on the stock don't know answering machines can you imagine well some company used to make them with all those jobs wiped out by your cell phone same with the answering services for that matter talk about jobs that aren't coming back anyway i'd say hi this is jim i'm not here right now but i like both the chart and the recent numbers from people express a long since bankrupt airline that i used to jet down to new york for job interviews my best one recommendation for monolithic memories a smoke show of a company with a red hot stock that was run by a guy named zeve drory who you know two decades later helped save tesla back when it was struggling during the financial crisis he was the last ceo before elon musk anyway monel shot up like a rocket that we can only we ended up being acquired by advanced micro devices at a very big premium it was the best kramer's not at home call this machine hit i had ever had and believe it or not jim is not home became a rallying cry for lots of people who were calling me back then hoping i wasn't home so they could get the tip without having to interact with me not long after i got a job at goldman sachs one of the officers at the fir called me in and got the machine with this rec he heard the recommendation he told me to call as soon as possible i did and he asked me if i knew what suitability was i had no idea so he introduced me to the concept he asked me did i ever consider that many people who called me may not be ready for the stock of the hottest semiconductor company in the land and that i was recommen recommending it to them one onone without any sense of it whether it was right for them suitability was it suitable i said i always thought the stocks were pretty much a caveat empor situation we all know that unlike say vacuum cleaners you can't take stocks back to the store get a refund they come with no guarantee so what's the deal this executive hammered it into my head that before you recommend a stock on a oneon-one level a registered brokerage house of all places you had to know what that person wanted out of what what did they want from stocks you had to know if the stock was right for them and for their level of risk tolerance mon of the memories she said wasn't exactly right for anyone other than the most risk-seeking investors out there the financial equipment of bungee jumpers so let's start there tday i want you to ask yourself what is your tolerance how much risk you want out of a stock you see stocks are pretty peculiar pieces of merchandise when you think about it you buy a car and you know it's not worth as much the moment it leaves the lot correct but there are all sorts of warranties you buy a house and you know it could burn down the next day however you can buy before you buy it you got a binder with insurance so if it does burn down you can get your money back clothes can be returned devices return phones pcs washers dryers you name it but stocks if you buy a share of nike and the next day goldman sachs downgrades it and then that day after foot locker says there's a bit of slowdown in jordans you can't go back to your broker and say hey chief you never told me this can happen i'm down 300 bucks on 2,000 shares and i'm out of six hey man i'm i'm losing too much money i want my money back sorry caveat empty now back then when i got started it would have been incumbent upon the broker to recognize that the buyer would know these things could happen maybe the broker should never been recommending that stock to begin with you get the point though because you can't take stocks back and get the same price because there's no real insurance although you could buy an expensive put option underneath with the cost that lowers the risk of nike pretty dramatically and has to be renewed constantly suitability is incredibly important that's why for the next hour you're going to learn how to measure your own tolerance versus a variety of factors because these days with digital brokers there's no real protection just a sign form that says you get it you may not know what you're getting into tonight the bottom line that stops here by the end of this show you'll know what suits you and what doesn't no matter what your age or your style or to put it that another way caveat amper no just buy or be a little more aware of what you might be committing your hard-earned dollars to when you purchase a stock let's take calls let's go to kyle in new jersey kyle best friend jim kramer how are you buddy i am good kyle thanks for calling how can i help you so i was wondering first of all i am an investment club member and this is my third time talking to you man and i feel like i know you personally i love you to death thank you um i would like to know how often you look at rsi or macd data when you're buying or selling a stock how i'm done look at the at the relative strength index in the back i have to tell you i look all the time i do not like to buy stocks where the chart is bad it's one of the reasons why we do off the charts on tuesdays i think it's incredibly important kyle because others do and anything that's important to others is important to to me mark in new york mark what is up jimmy chill chill man here what's happena account i have an ira account for my retirement and i was wondering if it's okay to take some profits and then reinvest the cash in my account at another time well you know i prefer you to let it run unless the stock is really sour uh because i i just think i don't want you remember we're investing for the long-term in ira and i have to believe that what you saw on the stock is continued otherwise look if you have to take a loss take a loss but keep investing in your ira that's the best thing to do let's go to nick in florida please nick jimmy chill my question when you help your children invest is it more important to save up and give them say a big snowball a big lump of money when they get married or set them up early literally an infant pay the baby with say a small amount in dividend stocks to rephrase it in such a way which is more important the size of the snowboard or the height of the hill that compounds it wow i love that well first i can't help my kids they have to do that in their own because of my job i'm not allowed to know what they're up to but what i always say to my kids is is that look i want you to go make as much money as possible with half the money and the other half i want you to do index funds and go learn some stocks i think when they finally decide what they're going to do with their lives they can do it but that's my advice to them now i don't know what they own because that wouldn't be right by the end of tonight's show i hope you'll know what suits you and what doesn't no matter what your age or your investing style tonight i'm helping you form the necessary investing strategies you need at all stages of your life from young to old just like the gentleman we just talked to i'm going to meet you where you are and take you where you need to be so stay with [applause] [music] kramer don't miss a second of mad money follow @ jim kramer on x have a question tweet kramer # mad mentions send jim an email to madmoney cnbc.com or give us a call at 1800 743 cnbc miss something head to madm money. cnbc.com [music] good evening mr kramer thank you thank you for everything you do you've been such a wonderful source of information with your teachings i have to say thanks thank you for all your advice and saving us from our out your advice let me quit a job that i hated i love you to death thank you for everything you do thanks for making us money more importantly thanks from keeping us from losing [music] [music] money tonight's all about you about knowing what you can and can't do because it's not right for you because it's not suitable now there are all kinds of suitability considerations in the business first and foremost there's age suitability i want to start with kids prickly babies m money's been on so long now that there are kids who were born who are in their teens uh or and if their parents listen to my best piics when we got started they'd already be well on their way towards some great wealth parents grandparents listen up you can give all sorts of things to families that just had babies i want you to open up accounts for them or at least give them some shares of stock so that from the moment the earliest moment you can start the process of saving now here's my commercial for something it doesn't need a commercial because almost every expert you hear from is in love with them i'm talking about index funds which aren't perfect but they're the best way to go if you want to put your money on autopilot and you can't spend a lot of time looking at individual stocks just a bu and better the whole market so if you just had a kid you can you can take a couple of hundred smackers and buy some shares and an index fund for them i'm partial to cheap etfs that mirror the s&p 500 because those 500 stocks represent the bedrock of america's publicly traded companies as a companion i like any sort of total return fund that has an even broader array of stocks a mix of both i think is a terrific way to start your broker or the brokerage site you use might have some fund that's higher growth a junior growth fund and that can be a nice augmentation because you're buying for an infant who's got his or whole life ahead of him the whole life these kinds of things can really compound over time meaning if you let it run then money can build up on itself now you might say why am i watching a show about stocks of all this guy's doing is talk about index funds look i could come out here every night and talk index funds but it wouldn't make for a very interesting show would it i wouldn't be giving you my best advice either i teach you how to pick individual stocks both here but really a huge amount in the cmc investing club because i believe that is the most effective way to go and i like to teach in the investing club it's my favorite venue i think you can build a portfolio yourself that can do better than most professional money managers or index funds you can control your own money but i'm perfectly sanguin about the notion that stock picking and index fund investing can coexist i just wish the prizers of index funds weren't such fundamentalists about how bad everything else is so i say let's give both a try when you're saving for your kids definitely start with an index fund now what's a good stock for a kid just just born i think that you should pick two kinds of stocks for your children one with a dividend where you can reinvest those dividend payments get the power of comp compounding that is such a good thing to teach people we often hear the term dividend aristocrats companies that have long histories specifically more than 25 years of increasing dividends love them it's hard to go wrong with the big well-run consumer package good place here i'm talking about a company like tried and true proctor and gable pepsico the best way to find out my absolute favorites as soon as possible is to join in that cc investing club i've mentioned and watch what we do with the travel trust at the same time you also want to give your kids something with a little more juice like the great growth stocks of an eara i mean i'm talking about the apples the the nvidias the teslas the the metas now if you do set up an account for your kids may i please suggest going with a uniform gift to miners act account i'm going to call it ugma for short okay ugma the rules keep changing for these but suffice to say that you can gift children money that can accumulate somewhat taxfree over time again the rules have changed so much from when i set up the mutual fund for my kids to tax favorite gifts i love them because they were like trust that you didn't need lawyers to create check with your broker for the latest rules for you in the state you're in they do differ i think it's one of the better tax breaks around though i know hunting for tax breaks may not sound very exciting but that's how you take care of your family besides who doesn't want free money there's one caveat with these ugm accounts though if your kid is planning to get financial aid in college you want to be very careful because that ugma money can count as theirs and might get them disqualified depending on the institution one other thought i like you know i believe the gold is a terrific insurance policy for any portfolio i'm going to talk more about this later tonight but a highly unusual yet totally blessed by me idea is to buy gold or silver coins for your kids or just pieces of gold or silver i've bought slivers of slivers for my kids from a deal and pretty much forgotten about them they may or may not increase these are polar opposites of growth or income stocks they don't throw off money they don't do anything but in crazy times when inflation comes roaring back and we now know it's certainly capable of happening go to pretty high levels 19 seen since the 80s there's nothing that's hold up in value under the scenario better than mansions masterpiece of art and precious metals one caveat if you do this remember to put the gold or silver in a safe place please that does not mean putting on masters and it certainly doesn't mean putting in a whole in the ground in the backyard a safety deposit box more my style so the bottom line when a child's born think about setting up a uniform gift to minor account and put index funds or individual stocks in there specifically i like cheap etfs that mirror the s&p 500 and on the stock side your kids will want to at least one dividend stock give them one dividend stock for income because a high yield stock can double the value of that investment by the time your baby turns 10 you also want one high quality growth stock that you believe in for the long haul because those can rack up big gains don't put this off this must be done at the earliest moment to get the most involved for your brand new loved one no one has ever regretted saving too early for their kids they have money's pack coming up want to turn back the clock and invest in companies for all the kids out there kramer's got you covered next [music] we're going over knowing thyself tonight how to not just buy the right stocks but the stocks that are right for you we discussed the importance of suitability and the essence of what's suitable for the newborns but what's suitable for the kids what do you do for them i think you should do everything in your power to get your kids involved and investing in stocks teach them that stocks represent pieces of companies that they might like now let's be honest these days most parents probably think they couldn't explain what a stock is to a kid especially a young kid that's not how i grew up in my house though as much as i love sports and we even had tickets for the 64 world series we didn't make it but we had them uh well to me stocks were supreme my father had gotten a tip from his brother who knew a stock broker he played tennis with guy told him to go buy a company shares in national video which for all i know would have made it if start right now as a facebook live show but in the 60s it was a total bust that cost our family a fortune pap would always bring home the philadelphia b oh they went out of business the afternoon edition and he wouldn't give me the sports section he gave me the business section he wanted me to learn about stocks i look up closing prices the market closed early back then i tred to anticipate where stocks were headed based on moving averages of how they were doing straight line this kind of thing it was a game of momentum game most of the time i only knew the stocks by their abbrev ations in what we call small aot type oh but it was fun game i kept the ledger to see how i would have done on tx which was texas instruments or maybe it was tgs which was texas gulf suver or ltv or rockwell h of companies that have disappeared got in ac choir or just still hang out and trade i also build a lot of airline stocks because suckers are always buying those and most kids are suckers eastern and national mostly but brand of too they were household names because of advertising of course most people under 50 have never heard of any of these i like the stock picking process so much i got my whole fifth grade class of pen manor involved we'd all pick stocks and keep track of the closing prices for a week to see who could make the most money the problem of course is that i was doing the exact opposite of what i should have been doing although metaphorically what i was doing then is still being done now just picking stocks by how fast they were climbing and backing away from them if their climb seem overextended or just slowed in velocity instead i should have been picking the stocks of companies i knew and ask asking my dad permission to buy actually one or two shares along with the money to pay for them which probably would have been a deal breaker so let's go over what would have been right and what was wrong in the picture i just painted think of this as goofus and gallon from the highlights magazines that you always used to find the dennis office gallant first of all would never have taken a tip about national video from his brother who taken a tip from his tennis partner who worked by the way for the aff mission bash i learned later my dad had no idea what national video even did imagine that he bought he didn't even know what they did now you can find out more about it via google right now than you could learn from jack the broker back then national video you see made vacuum tubes for tv sets in the old days when you had a problem with your television it was usually because the tube inside had blown of course the technology left national video behind so it went bankrupt closed it doors about 5 years after pop bought the stock but it been going straight down since about 5 days after he bought it he average down too many times to tell but i know we had many a silent meal thanks to that day decline in that godforsaken stock of national video i think we lost most of what we had as a family there were a host of better stocks you could have picked back in the 60s most weren't that good according to the moving averages but they paid generous dividends in retrospect what we needed more than anything else was income me the idea of picking stocks simply because they were going up was antithetical to the idea of buying stocks in companies and was more suited to dark throwing at least i picked the hot ones many of which were defense contractors that were getting rich as lbj escalated the vietnam war well for me the game was a lot of fun but in retrospect i learned the most about stocks from two 3m board games yes they used to have board games those board games were called acquire and stocks and bonds my father sold games for 3 a.m. back then this his job acir was all about murgers and acquisitions stocks and bonds was a fantastic game about accumulating wealth through risky or conservative stocks by the way you can get those they're on ebay you can see what i mean these days we have whole fantasy leagues of stocks but few of them can teach you more than that one board game stocks and bonds it holds up now let's go back in time and think about what i could have done differently first when you're a little kid you play with toys it would have been natural to buy shares inel or hasbro now i'm not asking the kids to know what it means to own shares in a company in terms of price earnings multiple or even earnings i'm simply saying it's a way to teach kids that a company can be owned by the public and you can own a share in that company too they no toys of course the irony should not be lost on my family can you imagine if my father had bought shares in a nice dividend stock for me 3m rather than national video we had a box of cheerios on our breakfast table every day of our lives we could have bought general mills what a fantastic stock and then there were the really easy one what kid doesn't want to go to disney world it's that factor and not how many many people sign up for the streaming service that will always drive me back to the stock the disney library alone should be enough to make you want to own shares in the company but the theme park i mean come on let's not outthink this game i don't know about johnson johnson's band-aids and shampoo they were staples and they've since been moved to ken view i knew then as well as i know now that kleenex is something you used to wipe your nose there's a good company kimberly clark these are things we aren't even taught they're imprinted finally there's fast food mcdonald's is obvious or the incredibly well run chipotle if you want something a little more organic bottom line please buy your kids a few shares in a name brand that they know and you know something they can see and hear and touch then put it away the stock won't always work out but think of what you like when you were little or when you're parents like when they were little see if it trades you more than likely have a long-term winner more importantly you've got a great hook to get your children into a lifetime of investing let's go to madison in texas madison hi jim if i can get a guaranteed interest rate of over 5% by purchasing a six-month treasury bond why should i invest in the equities market given market conditions okay because 6 months from now those rates may be lower you can continue to reinvest but the stock market is far exceeded uh longer term anything that you're going to get in the short term i'm not against 5% i own 5% paper myself but i will tell you this you want to take the long-term view and you can buy a dividend yielding stock that is very good like an enbridge you know like a one oak that'll have growth not just a dividend no growth owning treasuries let's go to annie and rhode island annie hi jim great to talk thanks for doing these teaching segments i appreciate it oh thank you thank you it's what i got to do i got to teach more and that's what i intended to do for the rest of this of the run what's going on okay um well i really enjoy the segments you do on technical analysis and i have two questions one um what are the best resources if you want to study this and how much should an amateur investor rely on charts versus fun fundamentals is it even appro great question um look i think charts are integral to your thinking um i i think that i um i really trade larry williams you just google larry williams his stuff is the best that's where i learn all of the great people we have on have websites but in the end uh technical analysis i think i have a very good chapter in my last book uh and in getrich carefully i spent a lot of time talking about technical analysis it must be done okay here it is i happen to have it right with me this is what my dad sold for a living can you imagine if he had bought this company 3m instead of national video we might have been able to not have to delute the grapefuit the grape juice i had to put the water in the grape juice i didn't even know why it's cuz we didn't have stocks and bonds buy your kids a few shares in their name brand something they can see and and hear and touch like i learned with this stocks and bond game that is available on ebay and believe me i wish i had the rights i' put it out again myself digitally there's much more made money ahead i'm giving you my best investing habit for the rest of your life routines to entir and everything in between and then i'm answering all your burning questions with my colleague jeff marx so stay with [music] kramer boo yaah for the emperor of crer honorable james j kramer you got me jumping around my office right now thank you so much for all you do for us i enjoy your show and i find it very entertaining and informative i watched your first ever episode of mad money back in 2005 and i've been watching every single episode ever since don't miss mad money every night at 600 p.m. eastern plus join the cnbc investing club and stick with kramer around the [music] clock boy i love you man i've been watching you from day one thank you for all the wonderful advice that you provide us i'm learning so much watching your show watch your program everyday love it always wanted to say booah on your show thank you for being the greatest in the world we consider you the money market maker and we thank you for all you do i love your show a long time fans your show and we think it's the most entertaining program on tv [music] teenagers are encourageable the last thing they want to hear about is stocks they have bigger fish to fry to which i say so what i'm not going to tell them what to buy i'm going to let them tell me people watching this show have been huge beneficiaries of the innate consumer wisdom of my two daughters we're always searching for ideas both on air and especially for the cnbc investing club and many of those ideas have come from young people children stepchildren their li and dislikes can tell you a great deal hey that's why i got behind domino so passionately for over a decade as the stock roared higher before peing at the end of the pandemic like most of the other delivery players sure i met with patrick doyle the day he became ceo stock was at 10 bucks yes the stuff did taste like cardboard before you reformulated the pizza in 2010 i love that whole line of advertising and told you i thought it was a good spec so sure i recommended it but that's not what made this stock of mad money crown jewel nah it was the technology see my kids like your kids hate talking on the phone they think it's for losers but apps they love them and when my kid discovered the domino's app well they were sold no talking to people who might get their order wrong no nervousness no worries about where their pizza was in the process that's two things that the great local joints couldn't do and a no cheese option for the vegans the ones that asked twice about the cheese as in are you sure you want no cheese i think that's because of my kids finally there was the joy of being able to pay online but before the delivery person got there kids don't want to fuss with money of course domino's was just the tip of the iceberg the delivery apps went on to take over the world all this technology was totally lost to me though i never minded the phone was always patient about when the pizza would arrive never cared about the interchange to delivery person in short i was not like the target audience that's why i started calling domino's a tech company that sells pizza although now competitors can just outsource the darn stuff at door dash many of you know the story of how i got religion on apple roughly 20 years ago my youngest daughter asked for a second ipod not because she lost it as i immediately accused her of doing but because she wanted one in another color for her see they were fashion accessories she didn't want it to clash with her outfits personal computers i mean come on my various employers have never embraced apple but my kids for a long time they'd rather be caught dead than use a windows machine they only wanted maxs the iphone was more controversial they don't like change they didn't like the plug change they didn't want the earbuds but what they really don't want is the samsung see they're part of the apple ecosystem the much derided much ignored apple ecosystem with its service chargers that make it so they have to pay to store all their millions of pictures what else fabulous google it dad yeah that's how i found out about google now alphabet and when i got the word from the kids they weren't allowed to google something that they were involved in the school well just count me in when i was doing my senior thesis at harvard to do some mindless name topping we had access to the fabulous librarians at hotton their job look up anything you wanted they had to go to the stacks for you as they were called and find out things that you would know where to look for well that's all digital now my kids get their news from their iphones and they get their entertainment from netflix no fang wasn't purely their creation i figured out amazon but facebook like i said it with the har when you were freshman you got a book it was called facebook and it had everybody's picture in it facebook is a derivation of that facebook my kids were on facebook earlier my youngest got sick of facebook early on probably because i got on it but then she went on to instagram which facebook cleverly acquired and then kept as something separate so you really didn't know it was part of something that older people had discovered i didn't think the ads worked until we were in undated with red hot chili pepper merchandise bought on a click for something that as my daughter said wasn't an ad just a link oh lordy does everyone else dream that they're at is just a link but it seems that only mark cerber has the forethought to care about the user experience to such an extent that it works cuz the ads actually make sense you do want to click on them how about chipotle the kids love the fresh and organic chipotle salad still do they're vegetarians my youngest returned pretty early after the food sickening incidents the only difference being that she didn't take out because she didn't want to be seen inside all right she want take out nothing's perfect about the pic but i recommended this stock from the low hundreds all the way to 2,000 largely because they liked it so much eventually your kids will age out of the key demographic however if you pay attention to their likes and dislikes you could get yourself decades worth of good stock picks but once they reach a certain age you need to pray for grandchildren if you want the freshest ideas what if the picks themselves aren't any good what if there ar that your kid likes a device that fits on your head and takes pictures or it fits on a wrist and measures steps i don't know hey that's the cost of learning remember they have their whole lives ahead of them to make that money back if it's a screw up you see that's the beauty investing you can lose it and no one will notice you pull the same kind of thing later in life at as real consequences like here for me so the bottom line is that for now you can learn from your teenage children trust me invest with them and you will not regret it mad money is back after the braak coming up are you trying to figure out which kinds of investments are right for your age well look no further professor kramer's taking up the assignment next [music] [music] all night i've been talking to you about suitability what's a suitable investment giving your tolerance for risk and especially your age or when you're picking stocks for your kids to get them interested in the market so how about the rest of our lives sadly as you get older you have less flexibility fewer investments are indeed suitable not initially though when you're in college i don't expect you to put any money away at all college costs too much when i used to be doing my college tours trying to get back in that game i tried to get people to buy a share or two of a stock but college saps to live in daylight out of you in so many financial ways i now regard as a total hardship to even contemplate savings but once you're out in the real world it's imperative that you save preferbly through a 401k plan at work or even better a self-directed ir now see i always prefer the latter because you can pick stocks not just pick from options chosen by your employer that typically have high fees that really knock your a return down that's for another show this is where you have to begin the mix of index funds and individual stocks remember i prefer both there's too much risk in individual stocks to just put together a portfolio of names of your own choosing so at a minimum i'm demanding that you put your first 10 grand of savings from your first job into an index fund the sb 500 being my favorite as i mentioned before now i know that some will argue with this i see them arguing on social media i don't care i know the truth the possibility of one really bad stock hurting your nest egg even as early as in your 20s is simply too risky with a nice slug of cash and index fund no single stock or even sector can do that but with the rest of your money behind your first that after that first 10,000 bucks i do like stocks and i do want you to be diversified and that's why we play a my adversary around here when we can where i try to explain what diversification is in a breezy way it's why we created the cbc investing club to show you how to invest using my travel trust as an example although the trust has a lot of restrictions to prevent me from using the show to juke the stats as they say in one of my favorites the wire but i can tell you that if you want in-depth work on stocks i frequently mention on this show the investment club is the way to go so i set it up because i always talk about buy and homework i tell you that you need to buy a stock but then you have to keep up with it buy and hold doesn't work remember back to earlier in the show when i discussed how hard it was to do the homework those trips to the harvard business school library to study months old research in micro now it's so easy that i've had to scrap one of my earlier road rules you no longer need to spend an hour a week studying each of your stocks sure you need to read the conference calls you can google articles schore so many that that you'll get sick of the process very quickly you could have articles and research pushed to you along with charts that i only could have dreamed of having 30 years ago or you can read what we write at the investing club let us help you do the homework whatever makes you the most comfortable in your efforts to take charge of your money is what i favor remember i want you to be either a good manager of your money or a good client i do not have a preference so let's talk about picking socks as you get older it it it's at this stage when you need to know thyself in terms of risk until you get to the late 20s at the earliest i want you to take tons of risk maybe more than you think you can handle whether you like it or not because you've got your whole life to make that money back if something goes wrong but when you get to your late 20s all i can do is ask you to think about what you'll do in a selloff do you have the we with all to take a decline and buy more or does a sell off sicken you and make you wish you had no exposure can you accept that stocks go down not a silly question given how they typically do go up over a period i'll be with periodic periodic spoons down that are painful these are crucial questions that only you can answer about yourself i would like you to take more risk and own more individual stocks that have growth characteristics once you put away that first 10,000 in fund but once you're in your late 20s i would hate to see you commit more than 20% of your money your mad money to speculative growth stocks as you get older i want you to capture more income by owning stocks that pay dividends perhaps add a fund that posts of high dividends than the s&p 500 offers but don't be too quick to do so in fact i wouldn't advise you to start investing for income until your 30s and even then you should do it gradually and small only in your 40s do i want to introduce bonds to your portfolio now in the old days it would have been hary toest you start investing in fixed income by your 30s let alone your 40s but the problem with that is twofold for life expectancy many people are out running their fortunes and the bond market itself there aren't always a lot of risk-free fixed income alternatives that don't entail a lot of risk generally i'd rather own a high yielding dividend stock that can raise its payout rather than a 30-year treasury bond that yields say 4% of course as you get older i recognize that most bonds do have that non- cavat empor provision you can and do get your money back can't say that with stocks as you to enter your 60s it's easy to see how you can put up to 50% of your money into bonds and take bonds up to 10% more each decade that brings us back to the notion of suitability if you can't handle the risk if you think the stock market is simply not as legitimate an asset class as it once was because it is prone to such deep values on what in retrospect look like overblown threats then i think you have to decide yourself if cashing out or taking stocks to minimum levels is right for you and i can't blame you if that's the case because it has been an uncertain asset the bottom line it's your life not mine so get comfortable with what you can live with but risk at least until your middle years should remain your best friend it's different [music] cr boah j i love you man i've been watching you from day one thank you for all the wonderful advice that you provide us i'm learning so much watching your show watch your program every day i love it always wanted to say booah on your show thank you for being the greatest in the world we consider you the money market maker and we thank you for all you do i love your show i a long time fans your show and we think it's the most entertaining program on tv [music] [music] i always say my favorite part of the show is answering questions directly from you and t i'm bringing in jeff marks my portfolio analyst and partner in crime help me answer some of your most burning questions now look for those of you who are part of the investing club definitely need no introduction for those of you who aren't members i hope you will and of course i want you to join i would say that justff insights and our back and forth helped me do a great job and him do a great job for all may have money viewers but more importantly for members of the club because this is what we really do now if you like just be sure to this thing you know i mean like i like when you go to like i went to a restaurant you got to do it my kids show me how to do it all right so first up i'm older first up we have tony in north carolina who asks in a losing position what is the difference between being stubborn or taking the loss and then revisiting okay well this is a fundamental question see in the end what a lot of people confuse is taking a loss you take a loss if you find that the fundamentals are deteriorating you don't take a loss because it's like you can't take it anymore so i i think that this notion of a losing position if it's a position where things have changed you should have taken it we have made the mistake at times of not identifying that there are changes at a company but we don't like to view a company as a loser or a winner and a stock is loser winner because some of our greatest picks have been losers sure there's broken stocks there's broken companies what you have to identify is that if the issue at hand is a structural issue at the company structural issue at the uh industry level then that you're being stubborn if you hold on for too long but it could present itself to be a great buying opportunity if you stick with it and the company's able to fix itself up and we've had those many of those over time all right now we're taking i'll look at some of our of your mad mentions so let's go to isaac who says jimbo which is what everybody calls me at home by the way jimbo my whole family loves your show thank you i don't think i've bought or sold anything in the past 30 years without checking you see if you said anything about the stock now this is what i love see isaac uses us as a resource one of many resources i have never claimed to be the sear i have claimed and by the way uh someone someone stopped this morning says you know you're a great entertainer well i i like to entertain to bring people in i'd like to think that i'm not just a great entertainer but what i would point out is that i want you to check you should check maybe we've said something we're input that's what we are we are an input are we the input no but we are an important input i believe in making stock decisions yeah absolutely it's doing the homework showing you how to do the homework so you at home don't have to right still have to but it's it's a guiding hand look i always i always say that if you want that there are people a lot of people say just own index funds i disagree with that uh there are always people going to want to own stocks if you want to own stocks watch the show you member of the club you'll be be much better at it all right next up we're taking a question from rachel in florida who says hi jim we have a 30-year plus time horizon we inhe her some money we don't need to live on does jim advise against investing 20 25% of that money into s&p and the rest in stocks and bonds okay this is really important all right now 30-year plus time rise stocks yes bonds no you don't need bonds until you get very old this is one of the points where i am definitely at odds with most of of the so-called sears out there i say that when you buy a lot of bonds you're betting against your life if you think you're going to pass away and when you're 72 then it it's 65 yes buy bonds i want people to think young i know that sounds almost poana but the reason why i say it is because if you have to go into a long-term care facility and you own bonds for the previous 20 years you're not going to have enough money stocks historically have outperformed by 30 years long-term time horizon the key line too you're fortunate enough where you don't need to live off that money that means you don't have the risk of selling it in a potential market downturn uh you can stay invested in the market and over time uh you should do quite well yeah i know look i i think that when you it's really a tricky question because people don't really like to talk about mortality but what really does matter is that if you have a long life and you've cashed in on bonds in your 50s and 60s you you you're going to be broke you'll be broke as long as you take that horizon you can ride things out with stocks and i think you have before bonds anyway thank you jeff i'd like to say there's always a bull market summer and i promise try to find it just for you right here on may monday i'm jim kramer and we'll see

"China is 'flexing its muscles' with PVH supply chain probe, says China Beige Book CEO",2024-09-25 22:31:22+00:00,6,tnuh7LZajZw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnuh7LZajZw,">> nothing gets between you and  your calvins. >> precisely. in that movie, michael j. fox  went back to the future. he wore calvin kleins. worked for him. >> look good. >> back to business here. let's get more on where  u.s./china relations stand, with lee land miller. great to have you with us. in regards to pvh, the  investigation of pvh, do you  think this is part of a tit for  tat at this point? >> well, it's muscle flexing. either the chinese would do tit  for tat if they could, but the  reality is the u.s. and  western -- and the west writ  large have much more leverage  over china than china has over,  you know, the united states, for example. so, the u.s. has a larger trade  sur surplus, it has control of the  dollar payment mechanism, it has advanced technology that it can  ring fence from china. so, china doesn't always have  the ability to tit for tat,  which is why there's not usually a reaction to everything the  united states or western  governments do, but ultimately,  they have to flex their muscles  every once in awhile, say, look, we do have leverage over you,  and one of the biggest points of leverage the chinese have is  sales of western companies in  china. and they can shut that down. and i think every once in  awhile, they try to teach a  lesson to say, we are not  without levleverage. pain will come to you, too. >> can you put this into context in terms of stimulus efforts? we heard about the first tranche of stimulus overnight, the day  before, and another tranche  today, where they're actually  going to be paying -- part of it is paying poor people, actually  direct checks, direct money,  which is sort of a departure  from what they typically do. where -- how vulnerable is  china, given what it is doing? >> well, the economy is weak,  and it's been getting  particularly weak in the last,  you know, couple of months. so, there was a little bit of  worry on the ground. but i think what this is is an  attempt to boost sentiment. i don't think that the  leadership in beijing stays up  worrying about the state of the  economy as a tier one issue. i think they don't like that  it's not doing very well, but  it's not collapsing, it's not  doing terribly, it's just not  doing very well. so, every once in awhile, they  have to step in during this  protightening of credit that's  been going on for years and  show, the government's still  here, there will be policy  support. and so, they stepped in on  credit, they stepped in on  property, they stepped in on  stocks, they stepped in a little bit with giving money to  households, and to show, look,  there will be a policy response  to weak -- to weak results. i just wouldn't read into it,  you know this is not a bazooka. >> leland, how about china's  approach to their own company? part of the discount to chinese  shares has been a function of  chinese government beating them  down. any thoughts on whether there's  been a policy change? or are there sectors, they at  least might be more in favor. how about china? >> well, certainly, over the  last several years, the focus of credit, and focus of government  policy support, has been in  advanced manufacturing. it's technology. xi jinping made it very clear  that he wants china to win the  fourth industrial revolution,  which means dominating the  sectors in the future, a.i.,  quantum, robotics, biotech. so this is where they're focused on from an economic and national security standpoint. that doesn't mean they can do it efficiently, it doesn't mean,  you know, it's easy to move into these sectors. they're throwing a lot of cash  at them. but on the western side,  particularly the united states,  they are ring fencing the  ability to put capital into  china that's inching its way  forward. their export controls have  increased, so, it's not just so  easy to invest in these sectors. if beijing wants you investing  in these sectors, it probably  means the western government  doesn't. >> china/taiwan, china/singapore has been an issue for a long  time. is a weakened china less or more likely to do something in those  two areas? >> this is the big debate. one of the worst case scenario  is a china in extraordinarily  bad shape and needing to wag the dog and doing something. but look, all of this is  speculation. it's about making sure that, you know, i don't think a collapsing china is good for anybody, but  it's about making sure that the  united states policy, in  particular, is not signaling,  you know, leaving asia, leaving  the taiwan to their own devices. you don't want to give an  opening here. i think you want to make sure  you keep deterrence at a very  high level so you're not luring  beijing into doing anything it  otherwise might not do. >> should there be any concern  that one of the weapons in  china's arsenal is a taiwanese  company, maybe something like a  s taiwan semi, which holds the  cards when it comes to a.i.  chips? >> well, look, if taiwan semi  conductor goes down, then  there's going to be a  cataclysmic world recession  around it, . so, these are -- these are not  moves, i think, that beijing  knows it can take lightly. this starts a process that  unravels the world economy. so, yes, it's a vulnerability. it's a vulnerability for western supply chain","Category: Macro

Meta's Chief Product Officer Chris Cox talks new AR glasses,2024-09-25 22:05:49+00:00,6,kzGRdh63RKU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzGRdh63RKU,"meta hitting a record high  today. that's after today's meta  connect developer conference  where the company announced its  long-awaited ar glasses  prototype along with a new vr  headset and a.i. features. joining us for a rare and  exclusive interview is meta  chief product officer chris cox, along with our own julia  boorstin. julia? >> morgan, thanks so much. chris, thank you so much for  being with us today. you've been with facebook since  the very beginning, the very  early days. and today we just saw the  unveiling of the most futuristic technology meta has ever  unveiled. the new orion augmented reality  glasses. they are lightweight, but  there's no date or price tag, no sense of when they'll launch. why are you investing so much in this technology and how will it  eventually tie into your  business? >> yeah, so today we announced a prototype of orion. we wanted to show the demo to  people just to show what we've  been working on. it's the most advanced pair of  glasses ever made. it's lightweight, it's got  really powerful computing in it. you can see through it so you  can make eye contact. but they project a holographic  display so that you can summon a screen or look at your messages, you can watch video, you can  have a video chat with somebody. we've been investing for this  for a long time just because we  are asking the questions sort of what comes after the smartphone. and what happens in a world  where you're not sort of  constantly checking the phone in order to understand how to  interact with other people or to check whatever it is you're  looking at. so this is a major leap forward  for technology, it's a big step  forward for our sort of goal to  help define the next generation  of computing. and it was the most i'd say  premium thing we showcased to. >> it was fascinating to see. what i'm curious and i see  you're holding a pair of the  meta rayban glasses, these are  a.i. glasses, you can ask  questions, they can give you  answers, information, help you  set reminder. when will we see augmented  features incorporated into  something like this? i'm trying to understand the  business potential. are you going to be selling this time. ar capability for $1,000 or will it eventually in two years be  $300? >> these things are doing pretty well right now in the market. you can buy them in just about  any rayban store. you can talk to them, you can  ask questions about what's  happening in front of you. you can ask it to play music,  you can make calls with it. they've been very popular. >> you can't tell us how many  you've sold. >> year not announcing that  today. but we did announce a new model  today. so we're starting to be  available in more styles and  rangings. these look good. they're comfortable, they're  easy to use. we've worked hard to get latency down which is how long does it  take for the assistant to  respond, can you interrupt it? in order for these things to be  natural, you want the voice  interactions to be really,  really close to the way you'd  talk to somebody else, which  means you respond immediately. you can interrupt each other, et cetera. so lot of big advancements  coming there, as quickly as we  can. >> chris, it's morgan. great to have you on the show. one of the key messages or  takeaways for me today from the  connect conference was the fact  that a.i. is driving product  value. i wonder how you are thinking  about that right now, if this is a situation where meta goes it  alone, or would you actually  entertain the thought of  integrating into another  platform like, say, apple  intelligence? >> so the big announcement on  the a.i. side for consumers  today was meta a.i. voice. so you can now talk to meta a.i. it's got really good porousity,  it's a natural melody in a way  of interacting with it. the latency is really low. starting today in the u.s., you  can start talking to meta a.i.  and have a natural conversation  in order to talk to it. we have open sourced llama, our  large language foundation model. there are already -- i think  over 400 million downloads of  folks integrating into it all  kinds of different interfaces. whether those be new types of  devices, whether they are  different cloud providers, et  cetera. so we've been open about our  approach. i think that distinguishes us  from others, and as i mentioned  to, it means our models get  better faster. >> chris, it's john. i'm most curious about the meta  quest 3s which you announce  today of $300. mixed reality. breakthrough price point. my question is about the  business model because often if  you've got one of these  subsidized hardware situation,  it's because if it's a gaming  console a company expects to  make money on the software. otherwise, it's kind of hard to  scale, isn't it, without l loseation whole lot of money --  losing while lot of money if  people want to buy hundreds of  thousands or millions of these? >> so what we're seeing there is there's a huge now growing range of apps. so the same business model you  see for a device category like a smartphone applies here. which is that we benefit when  developers are using our  systems. we also know that more  developers means that the  toolkit for building in mixed  reality gets better faster. we see that eventually applying  to ar. so everything we talked about  today with orion will accrue  benefit from all the stuff  that's happening today in vr. in that way for the long-term  business model of the company,  it behooves us to have a  toolkit, active developer  ecosystem, lots of folks making  refinements and improvements. and then development in each  category, whether it's  entertainment, whether it's  fitness, gaming, whether it's  utility, productivity we showed  off today. some of the work that you can do to make your heads","Category: Technology

Meta's Chief Product Officer Chris Cox talks new AR glasses,2024-09-25 22:05:49+00:00,6,kzGRdh63RKU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzGRdh63RKU,"meta hitting a record high  today. that's after today's meta  connect developer conference  where the company announced its  long-awaited ar glasses  prototype along with a new vr  headset and a.i. features. joining us for a rare and  exclusive interview is meta  chief product officer chris cox, along with our own julia  boorstin. julia? >> morgan, thanks so much. chris, thank you so much for  being with us today. you've been with facebook since  the very beginning, the very  early days. and today we just saw the  unveiling of the most futuristic technology meta has ever  unveiled. the new orion augmented reality  glasses. they are lightweight, but  there's no date or price tag, no sense of when they'll launch. why are you investing so much in this technology and how will it  eventually tie into your  business? >> yeah, so today we announced a prototype of orion. we wanted to show the demo to  people just to show what we've  been working on. it's the most advanced pair of  glasses ever made. it's lightweight, it's got  really powerful computing in it. you can see through it so you  can make eye contact. but they project a holographic  display so that you can summon a screen or look at your messages, you can watch video, you can  have a video chat with somebody. we've been investing for this  for a long time just because we  are asking the questions sort of what comes after the smartphone. and what happens in a world  where you're not sort of  constantly checking the phone in order to understand how to  interact with other people or to check whatever it is you're  looking at. so this is a major leap forward  for technology, it's a big step  forward for our sort of goal to  help define the next generation  of computing. and it was the most i'd say  premium thing we showcased to. >> it was fascinating to see. what i'm curious and i see  you're holding a pair of the  meta rayban glasses, these are  a.i. glasses, you can ask  questions, they can give you  answers, information, help you  set reminder. when will we see augmented  features incorporated into  something like this? i'm trying to understand the  business potential. are you going to be selling this time. ar capability for $1,000 or will it eventually in two years be  $300? >> these things are doing pretty well right now in the market. you can buy them in just about  any rayban store. you can talk to them, you can  ask questions about what's  happening in front of you. you can ask it to play music,  you can make calls with it. they've been very popular. >> you can't tell us how many  you've sold. >> year not announcing that  today. but we did announce a new model  today. so we're starting to be  available in more styles and  rangings. these look good. they're comfortable, they're  easy to use. we've worked hard to get latency down which is how long does it  take for the assistant to  respond, can you interrupt it? in order for these things to be  natural, you want the voice  interactions to be really,  really close to the way you'd  talk to somebody else, which  means you respond immediately. you can interrupt each other, et cetera. so lot of big advancements  coming there, as quickly as we  can. >> chris, it's morgan. great to have you on the show. one of the key messages or  takeaways for me today from the  connect conference was the fact  that a.i. is driving product  value. i wonder how you are thinking  about that right now, if this is a situation where meta goes it  alone, or would you actually  entertain the thought of  integrating into another  platform like, say, apple  intelligence? >> so the big announcement on  the a.i. side for consumers  today was meta a.i. voice. so you can now talk to meta a.i. it's got really good porousity,  it's a natural melody in a way  of interacting with it. the latency is really low. starting today in the u.s., you  can start talking to meta a.i.  and have a natural conversation  in order to talk to it. we have open sourced llama, our  large language foundation model. there are already -- i think  over 400 million downloads of  folks integrating into it all  kinds of different interfaces. whether those be new types of  devices, whether they are  different cloud providers, et  cetera. so we've been open about our  approach. i think that distinguishes us  from others, and as i mentioned  to, it means our models get  better faster. >> chris, it's john. i'm most curious about the meta  quest 3s which you announce  today of $300. mixed reality. breakthrough price point. my question is about the  business model because often if  you've got one of these  subsidized hardware situation,  it's because if it's a gaming  console a company expects to  make money on the software. otherwise, it's kind of hard to  scale, isn't it, without l loseation whole lot of money --  losing while lot of money if  people want to buy hundreds of  thousands or millions of these? >> so what we're seeing there is there's a huge now growing range of apps. so the same business model you  see for a device category like a smartphone applies here. which is that we benefit when  developers are using our  systems. we also know that more  developers means that the  toolkit for building in mixed  reality gets better faster. we see that eventually applying  to ar. so everything we talked about  today with orion will accrue  benefit from all the stuff  that's happening today in vr. in that way for the long-term  business model of the company,  it behooves us to have a  toolkit, active developer  ecosystem, lots of folks making  refinements and improvements. and then development in each  category, whether it's  entertainment, whether it's  fitness, gaming, whether it's  utility, productivity we showed  off today. some of the work that you can do to make your heads","Category: Technology

"Mag 7 companies have shown weak spots in past few months, says NYU's Aswath Damodaran",2024-09-25 20:08:17+00:00,5,BhnlVZfB-0o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhnlVZfB-0o,"little steam and big tech's  performance starting to split,  as well. nvidia adding to yesterday's  gains. it's back above $3 trillion in  market cap as we speak. there's the 2% move today. meta's higher, as we told you,  on the heels of its connect  conference. apple, amazon, alphabet all down today. joining me to help navigate the  tech story with earnings just  weeks away now, the dean of  valuations, nyu stearns school  of business. welcome back. >> hi, escoscott. >> when you look at the  multiples of the mag seven, what do you see? >> i see the fact that these are the companies everybody wants to flock to. in the last few months, we've  had reminder with each of these  companies about the weakest  links. with nvidia it was around the  earnings announcement which as  you saw how high expectations  have been set and what looked  like a good earnings report  turned out to be a  disappointment. with apple we've lived from  upgrade to upgrade. up to 16. one measures up to expectation,  the next doesn't. with google we're still waiting  for the next big business. they still make so much of the  money from the search box. so much as these companies have  been winners, they also have  weak spots. i think in the last few months  you see those weak spots  sometimes highlighted which  explains why on any given day  two of them are up and two of  them are down. it's the for of the beast. >> -- the nature of the beast. >> are you suggesting let's talk specifically nvidia, apple,  alphabet, are you saying they're overvalued currentli? >> i think -- not overvalued or  undervalued. if investing is a game of odds,  with nvidia the odds are against you because of housewife high a  price you pay -- how high a  price you pay. with apple it might be even  odds. with alphabet and meta, the odds are still with you because to  the extent that these companies  can put up something outside the core businesses you're going to  get the bonus for that. so rather than think  undervalued, overvalued, i think in terms of investing odds. in terms of investing odds i  think the worst odds are with  nvidia. best odds might be with the  companies that have at that  moment at least are companies  not in the favored group. >> that's interesting that  suggest the worst odds are with  nvidia. just given what we've heard even -- >> as an investor. as a trader, i reverse the whole thing. all about momentum. it's got nothing to do with  fundamentals. it's got nothing to do with, you know, what the business looks  like. nvidia is the perfect momentum  play in either direction. if you're a trader, i can see  why nvidia is going to be where  you're going. as an investor, the worst stocks are with nvidia. >> i want to address it as an  investment to make because i --  you know, 34 times, it's cheaper than it has been for certain. secondly, we've heard from  jensen wong recently, in the  last couple of weeks, about the  great demand that the company  continues to see. they have by all accounts what  many would suggest to be not  just a first mover advantage  but, in fact, a moat because of  their installed base. much like we talk about apple  having, how does that all factor in, though? >> let me concede all of those. it's an amazing company going  after a big market this it's  going on dominate because it has immense moats. but that would mean that you  would need $1 trillion in  revenues and 70% margins to be  delivered ten years from now. reverse engineering from the $3  trillion market cap. so even if you took every word  that jensen wong takes as the  truth and you build it in, i  still have a tough time getting  to $3 trillion. this is a company that if you  look at the current numbers has  immense growth and maintains 70% operating margins to deliver  what you paid already up front  as a price. that's what i mean about  investing odds being, you know,  against you. you price this company to be the most amazing company of all  time. where is the upside left? if it's amazing rather than the  most amazing company, that's a  disappointment. so i think this is something  you're going to see the back and forth on in terms of  expectations. but the expectations at some  point have to get reset. so the company -- >> did you sell any of your own  shares? >> i sold half to the extent  that i did it a year ago. i might be due for another half  to be sold at some point in  time. but the last time i valued was  after the earnings report. least overvalued it looked since the a.i. boom started. so in a sense, if i were going  to sell at -- three months ago,  four months ago when it hit 136  would have been the time to do  it. i'm watching the price. and ","Category: Technology

"Apple's event was more about 'incremental updates' to AI vision, says Deepwater's Gene Munster",2024-09-25 20:06:17+00:00,7,0mJe-K3uuhQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mJe-K3uuhQ,"headset that's out now that  costs $499. scott, so quite a price cut  there. >> thank you so much. >>> joining us is gene munster  of deep water asset managements, firm owns meta. good to see you. what's your reaction to what  julia told us they did? >> scott, as a meta investor,  i'm surprised that the stock has kind of held its gains today. i continue to believe in what  this company is doing in terms  of infusing a.i. to really drive engagement across the  properties, the three-plus  billion active daily users. that is the substance. then also some of the -- what  the framework that they're on  around wearables is important. but the -- the details, the  substance of today i think was a little thin. the really -- the part of the  most tangible announcement was  this 500 million users of meta  a.i. they're basically infusing that  into instagram and whatsapp and  to certain countries and  facebook. so it's a little bit different  than like a comparable 200  million daily active number from openai. and then they had the price cut  like julia talked about. and so this was more about  incremental updates to what  their vision is. i want to underscore the real  takeaway here is beyond being  incremental, there something  that is material which is meta  is making it clear they believe  in a future where smart glasses  or they refer to them as a.i.  glasses, are going to be  hundreds of millions of units. today if you look at quest, it's probably five million units. probably 1% of sales. but they're really putting the  stake in the ground. if you look at the stock, it --  it jumped 1% on this news of  orion. orion is probably three to five  years away from seeing the light of day. and so i think that that really  underscores that jump in the  stock is that investors are  really want to hear and are glad to hear that meta is putting  their foot down, that they see a future in a.i. glasses and  wearables. >> do you think that the jump in the stock -- we can see from  year to date it's you 60%-plus. do you think all of that is  justified? >> i do. i think that if you look at  what's happened with their  earnings, i mean the stock is up 60%-plus earnings, the multiple  has gone up from 19 times the  outyear to about 29 times. but earnings during that period  are up about 40%, and we still  haven't really begun to see the  benefit of a.i. and i want to put substance,  when we talk in a.i., a lot of  times it's like theory, like  what is the real tangible piece  here. and when it comes to the stock  and -- about what earnings are  going to be in the future, the  ability for a.i. to drive  engagement, to make it easier  for creatives to build content,  to make the content better  targeted at users, that also  improve engagement, all that i  think is still largely to come. when i think about where the  stock can go and think about the earnings power, i think that we  should see upside to numbers in  '25 as these features become  more mainstream with creatives  and their base alike. >> how do you feel about  alphabet with the firm owns, as  well? it's been an underperformer over the last month. it's had a good year like mega  caps have this. you have regulatory issues  swirling around there. and some others, too. how do you view it here? >> so we still like google, i  think when it comes to the  regulatory piece, we continue to believe that they're going to  successfully navigate this. i think ultimately is that their search business continue to do  exceptionally well in the june  quarter. that was a long time ago. the june down there, part of the june quarter up 14%, similar  growth rate as the march  quarter. so from our perspective is what  they're doing in terms of adding generative search to their  results and kind of -- layering  in gemini, seems to be having  the right effect. and ultimately the question  comes down to this is will a.i.  and regulation really sidetrack  the business? and for -- for a.i. to sidetrack the business for example, openai to come out of a product that is going to steal a share away from google search, it really needs  to be ten times better. and at this point, the way  gemini has been integrated  inside of google search, it's  openai and what they're going to do in search is not going to be  10x better. we continue to feel good. i mentioned wearables earlier. google, of course, has talked a  lot about wearables with their  astro project. and so i think that google is  still in a great place. it's the oxygen in the internet, and that hasn't changed. >> i think you're reasonably  identified with apple over the  years. i know your firm doesn't own it, but you do personally. used to cover it, obviously, in  your former existence on the  street. there are a lot of notes out  today that are calling into  question demand about the 16. they're counting on a huge  upgrade cycle, right? the stock had a massive move  from the developers conference  on, right? and now we're hearing doubts  about lead times and what real  demand is going to be. do you have a sense of what the  real story here is ? >> i do. we've done a lot the past couple of months in terms of what this  cycle is going to look like. and ultimately i think that  iphone is going to probably grow closer to 10 to 15% in fiscal  '25, the street now is about 7%. and part of the reason is that  -- i don't think the street has  really -- understands how big of an upgrade wave is coming. numbers get thrown out there. i want to make it easy for  investors. in 2021 the iphone business was  up 39%, had a huge surge  obviously because of the  pandemic. the average upgrade life is  about five years for an iphone. we're going to start to see this mass -- the massive wave coming  into an upgrade window. so that alone along with  easycomes should employ up--  easy comps should employ up  features that are must have. that's the part that is a guess  on my part. it's -- what i've seen in the  future, i haven't ","Category: Technology
Stock mentioned: Meta, Nvidia, Tesla
Key takeaways:
* Meta is focusing on infusing A.I. into its platforms to drive engagement among its billions of users and is emphasizing the future potential of smart glasses.
* Nvidia is poised for growth as earnings continue to rise, driven by the increasing importance of A.I. in driving engagement and content creation.
* Tesla's upcoming iPhone upgrade cycle is expected to lead to a 10-15% growth in fiscal '25, surpassing current market expectations."
"Earnings trajectory is under-appreciated in the near-term, says HSBC's Max Kettner",2024-09-25 20:00:07+00:00,7,yot84tOckW4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yot84tOckW4,"but in the face of unrelenting  bad news for china. to me a rally on bad news is a  sign that maybe the worst is  already priced into china, and  that means it could rally for a  while. >> kevin gordon and max kentner. good to have you with us. kevin, you've heard tom state  his case for stocks in the near  term. what do you think? >> i largely agree with that. i think if you're approaching it from a pe versus earnings  standpoint how much is left to  be squeezed out of the valuation upside, probably not as much  given we look pretty stretched,  whether you're looking sector by sector or looking at the  aggregate market. i think that in terms of the fed reaction, i think it's a little  bit -- i know there's a lot of  obsession around the cut itself  and what it means. but i think you have to sort of  take a step back and think about what the fed's looking at being  economic data, and ultimately  that's what the market looks at. as we continue to go through  this churn where more sensitive  rates of the economy to respond  to what the fed is doing in  terms of cutting and hopefully  find revival in the next six  months versus what's now going  on in services and labor if we  continue to see softening  trends. the latter if that happens  probably won't be the most  bullish case for the market. >> max, what's your view? >> yeah, look, i think -- i'm  still -- in the near term on  stocks in particular. and yield stocks in particular. we've been buying the -- the dip in the last couple of months,  and we continue to do so. i think actually there are  probably a little bit too much  obsession around the u.s.  election, but do think one thing that is under appreciated is the earnings trajectory in the very  near term. we look at the q3 report, for  example, at the s&p, in fact we  see earnings expectations from  consensus almost flat quarter  over quarter on an aggregate  basis. it's tech up, utilities up, the  sort of normal q3 seasonality. other than that, every other  sector is either flat to  slightly down. so i do see the risk. the upside risk. that clearly -- people are --  have focusing too much on the  noise and not really taking into account still really solid  fundamentals. i would agree with what you guys have been talking about before,  there is an awful lot of talk  still about recession and around severe slowdown. in fact, when we look for  example to colleagues, they run  a quarterly emerging markets  sentiment survey which came out  today where basically  expectations around a recession  are a major drawdown in dm,  developed market activity, is by far the biggest risk that  investors see. that more than tripled over the  last quarter, that sort -- those kind of recession fears. and following up, when we look  at our sent. and positioning indicators, even though we're at an all-time high and high yield spreads and  investment grade is sub 90  you're still seeing our  sentiment and positioning closer to a buy signal rather than a  sell signal. that to me, i don't want to be  cautious at that point. >> what about, tom, this idea as max said, there's too much  obsession about the election. i think people would say i don't think so. what do you think? >> i think elections are very  emotional issues, and i think it does cloud people's willingness  to take risk or how they react  to information. so i -- i kind of agree with the idea that the stock market's  going to be fine regardless of  who wins. but between now and then, it's  very difficult for an  institutional manager to make a  big bet one way or another  because the election and it  could be a disputed election. >> i mean, you have  diametrically different tax  policy being discussed by the  candidates. so how -- how's it a win either  way? >> i think one thing that  investors have to be mindful of  is unless there's a republican  sweep or a democratic sweep,  then these are just policy  platforms that will have some  challenge to actually get put  into law. but i think more importantly  things like a.i. are really  shifting like the axis where all the future growth is coming  from, the u.s., and they're not  going to be hurt by whoever is  president. >> you think that the markets  reasonably value? we've had this conversation  about the multiple at the market trade and where earnings  expectations are for next year,  expected to grow 15%. do you think that's too  optimistic? >> valuation, it's in the eye of the beholder. we use valuation more as a  sentiment metric or indicator. in a stretched environment it  tells me people are willing to  pay a stocks -- i think we're  stretched given the fixed income environment how much it's  shifted the past few years. you still have income in fixed  income even with the rolling  over of yields. there's a bond relative to  stocks, to tom's point, there's  an and not an or when it comes  to stocks and bond. for earnings itself, the  somewhat maybe counterintuitive  aspect of earnings growth is as  you get further into the  earnings cycle and growth  accelerates well into  double-digit percentage  territory, that's consistent  with more tepid gains for the  market. not an outright decline. not negative gains annualized. the best zone is when you're  emerging from an earnings  recession and the market is sort of sniffing that out and  catching onto that force. now you've kind of priced it in  already, which is what happened  at the end of 2023 into the  beginning of this year. you're getting to the point  where it looks like the market  has looked ahead to what has  been and what will probably  continue to be relatively  healthy earnings cycle. >> is -- to that point, a good  one and made by others, too,  isn't a lot already priced in? >> yeah, but we could see this  six months ago, 12 months ago,  18 months ago. to the point in terms of the  earnings recovery, one thing is  clear when we look at the second quarter. we've actually just regained the levels where we were in 2022. the net income of the s&p 500  outside of the magnificent  seven, so those stocks, the  broader market that's literally  reclaimed the level where we  were at the beginning of 2022 in terms. net income. what that tells you is that is  still very much lagging versus  overall growth and as growth  still, you know, probably still  chugs along nicely with an  outcast 3% the higher data like  weekly activity index,  suggesting around 3% gdp growth  for q3, all of that should say  that we are right now getting  out of the worst and bottom of  the earnings recession for t","Category: Macro

"What stocks do in the next month is a 'coin flip' due to election, says Fundstrat's Tom Lee",2024-09-25 19:54:44+00:00,7,8VYXeDCgv68,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VYXeDCgv68,"we're watching auto stocks, too. morgan stanley out of jonas,  downgraded the space including  moving general motors to under  perform. that stock down by 5%. it takes us to the ""talk of the  tape."" how much more can stocks rise? tom lee is fund strat's head of  research, cnbc contributor. live at post nine. nice to see you. since the fed did the jumbo cut  the market hasn't done much  except for last thursday. why? >> you know, i think the fed  unleashed us on an easing cycle, and that's going to be positive. we know it's actually  historically positive, three  months, six months out. what stocks do in the next month is a coin flip. i think that's what we're seeing because there's some  repositioning that took place. and we're thinking about the 40  days until the election. >> so does the fact that the  election is but 40 days away  sort of ruin the perfect  scenario for stocks to get that  post fed bump? >> i think it delays it. just because -- in the  conferences that i'vebeen  speaking to -- speaking at and  seeing wealth managers and  family offices, a lot don't want to commit capitaled in after  election day. -- capital until after election  day. they want to get that event  behind them. >> you think we're going to have a dash to the finish after  election day is out of the way? >> yeah. and that's pretty typical. in fact, in election years the  november-december rallies are  tremendous. in fact, when markets are up  more than 10% in the first half, you also get big rallies  november, december. sort of choppy through  september. >> you think investors are sold  on the idea that the economy is  going to make it through, the  fed's going to pull this off? is any of what we've witnessed  since fed day doubts about the  bigger picture? >> so far so good. this friday we get core pce and  hopefully that confirms  inflation is no longer on the  front burner. i would say one thing i've  noticed is that the number of  investors and professional money managers that think we're  already in a recession is very  high. and so i think the evidence just has to be better than expected,  and i think those views shift  back to soft landing. >> when we've seen recently  targets for the s&p, brian  belski, the latest to raise the  target to the highest on the  street. i've asked you about the market  lately, you haven't sounded like you would be raising your own  target to a degree like that,  would you? >> you know, i think there is a  lot of upside in the foreseeable future. let's say three, six months out. but for someone to tactically  say we need to pen a 6,000  target and then put money to  work today, i think it's harder  to make that case because  valuations aren't on the cheaper end, and we've already had a  fairly sizable move. i'm not saying i'm like bearish  now, but to me i'm -- i have  more confidence saying three,  six months out. things are attractive. things like margin debt. it's decreased in august,  meaning investors have been  deleveraging. it hasn't gone anywhere for the  last four months at a time when  markets are rising. >> i guess my point would be it  would have been better  articulated to just say you  don't sound as bullish as you  usually are. is that fair? >> you know, yes. i'm bullish into year end, but  i'm less confident about how  markets behave into election  day. and not that i think we're going to have a huge drawdown, if we  do have a big drawdown, i'd be  buying that dip. but i also don't think we can  make new highs and then see the  market blast off after election  day. so i'd rather sort of say things look a lot better after election day. >> can we make new highs in tech doesn't resume its leadership  role in anywhere close to the  degree that it had? >> as long as tech is a market  performer -- if tech declines,  that's going to be hard for the  rest of the s&p 500 to  compensate. but what we've seen so far  including the days like nvidia  and tesla recently is that tech  is actually holding its own, but other stocks are starting to  show catalysts and signs of  life. >> what about the broadening  trade? i mean, you look at the russell, your big call, of course. two week date, down more than -- week to date, down more than 1%. hasn't done much. i keep hearing you got to wait  until the fed cuts then go into  the russell. i don't know. what do you think? >> russell had a big week last  week. some profit taking now. i think that there's -- this is  what bottoms look like. i don't think bottoms are  straight up. i know in 2021 energy was  bottoming, and it was also very  choppy. but eventually made not only new highs but then basically had a  blistering gain in 2020 and the  year following. i think that's a multiyear start for the russell. it feels choppy, but we're still near all-time highs. and there's a big fundamental  case to own small caps. >> some have made the case that  there are a lot of areas of the  market that are overcrowded at  the point. so many sectors have gone up a  bunch. you look at industrials and  utilities and other things that  have traded near or at highs. therefore, they find better --  value in bonds. what do you think? >> you know, i think a bond  investor is buying a bond for a  different reason than buying an  equity. because an equity gives you not  only inflation protection and  benefit from falling yields, but also capital appreciation and  positive surprise. bonds rarely give you positive  surprise. i think a bond investor should  -- someone should have some  income with some capital upside  there. but there are so many good  opportunities. and you know, the fact that  china has started to actually  perform better and potentially  broken out, that's again a brent signal. that's been a big drag the laugh few years. >> how about that? do you feel like the move that  happened in china is a game  changer on how we should view  what the potential turn in their economy means for the overall  markets? i mean could we've see certain  stocks get a nice boost. some of the luxury goods  companies. lvmp, estee lauder, et cetera. what about the bigger picture?

>> okay. i'm going try to make it as  quick as possible. you've got dysfunctional  agriculture legislation called  the farm bill. and that means that all these  tax subsidy dollars are going to gmo crops like corn and soy  because they're high yield. they're heavily sprayed with all kinds of chemicals and  fertilizers, pesticides,  herbicides, fungsides, this  bounty of cheap calories goes to big food. who mess with it more to make it really addictive, to undermine  your -- sorry, satiety and  inundate your environment with  it. so now they're exploiting our  psychological hungers, our  stresses. they're surrounding us with food so willpower in that fleeting  moment is gone because food is  everywhere all the time. and then it's biologically  addictive. they're hacking your biology and exploiting our psychology, and  then big pharma is waiting on  the other side to pick us up and give us obesity drugs, statins,  blood pressure medication -- >> i'm with you, but would it be better not to have big farm  trying to ride to the rescue? this system is what it is, we're not going to outlaw it at this  point. is it some pandemic -- some  break from the addiction? >> the hope that we would have a change with regard to our food  system and people's habits  around food and empower them to  start making some simple  changes, even just removing  soda. i can give you a long list of  the issues with these drugs, and i have done it a ton of times. but the reality is they cost  hundreds if not thousands a  month. they plateau, they come with a  host of very serious side  effects, and everything has to  be a cost benefit analysis. unless you're very ill and very  advanced with things like  type-two diabetes, heart  disease, chronic kidney disease, i don't think you really want to be looking at stomach paralysis, pancreatitis, the potential for  thyroid cancer, albeit rare,  nausea, vomiting, intestinal  blockage. >> there are also -- aren't  there, jillian, some salutary  effects, studies indicating they can be helpful in other ways. i want to make that point -- >> no. that's actually not true. >> well, i don't know that --  that that's a fact. i -- >> i have done quite a bit of  homework on it. i know all the studies that  you're referring to. and the reality is that we can't point to any mechanism outside  of weight loss in any way  conclusively, arguably with  people that have advanced  chronic kidney disease. they saw it slow progression,  but not reverse. in fact, if you look at what  does reverse kidney disease and  even prevent it, would be  exercise, being the most  powerful tool for prevention. get a walking pad. lose weight naturally, and you  will have no risk for side  effect, just as many benefits,  and more. so -- >> no, i don't disagree with  that one bit. let me ask you, the question i  really wanted to ask you is with respect to the -- to what is  being done and how our food is  being grown and processed, what  is the one thing if you could  correct one thing in that entire complex, what would it be? would it be removing excess  sugar? which i believe is an addictive  substance. would it be artificial colors? what -- you mentioned a lot at  the top. what would the one thing be? >> what you need to do is end  citizensish night and get the -- citizens united and get the  lobbyists out of washington and  it becomes very simple. they do this in europe, they  have a roadmap. if you look at the -- they're  illustrating in real time in  europe all this crap is banned. there's only 400 chemicals. we have 10,000 h","Category: Other

"Investors should be cautious going into the late third and fourth quarter, says Stifel's Bannister",2024-09-25 19:35:00+00:00,7,AlIhniN1l5I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlIhniN1l5I,"lunch"". the s&p 500 hit a record high  again today. earlier on following its 41st  record close of the year last  night. don't get too comfortable. stocks are lower this session  now, but our next guest is also  expecting a correction to the  low 5,000 by the 4th quarter or  a 10% drop from here. let's bring in barry banister. don't pop our balloons. everyone is saying it's going to look good into year end. why don't you think so? >> there's a lot of enthusiasm  right now. there's no question. a number of the economic  indicators, some of the  conference board readings such  as present conditions versus  expectations of conditions. the weakness in the breadth of  the payrolls, what's called a  diffusion index, the jobs  plentiful versus hard to get  heading down meaning we have  eroded some of that access  supply on labor demand. and bottoming out of unit labor  costs. this is going to affect upside  for inflation. when you add it altogether, it's a slowing economy, particularly  on the jobs side. there's a lot of optimism out  there in the market's expense. if so, we'd certainly urge  caution going into the late  third and fourth quarter. >> so you think we're going to  have headlines about a labor  slowdown, headlines about sticky wages or some sort of lingering  inflationary pressures to  deliver the basis points of cuts priced into the market, have i  got that right? >> yeah f you look at futures,  december 2025, fed funds  futures, they are slight ly belw 3%. it's very hard to justify  getting below 3% without a  slowdown. if we don't have any slowdowns,  if we continue to utilize these  limited resources that we have,  what you'd end up is a no  landing scenario where rates and yields should not be  dramatically lower. i don't have any problem with  views of the fed being more  dovish in 2024. it's what people expect in 2025  that's started to be priced in  and the 31% year to year gain in the s&p 500. everything just feels very  frothy. >> so you say a near three  generation high in the s&p 500  and the growth versus value the  out performance has never been  higher. and that has always press tijed  a recession and a bear market. >> we look at the growth rate of growth relative to value. you take the growth index with  dividends and divide it by the  value index. that's just growth relative to  value. then we do the growth rate. that way you can calculate how  much the growth managers have  walloped those in the last ten  years. the compounded, by over 7%. they outperformed them by 100%  at a 7 compound annual growth  rate. it's been miserable if you were  a value portfolio manager for  the past 10 or 12 years. however, since that financial  crisis low in '09 to now, you  have gotten in line with growth  versus value to where you were  in late '99, early 2000. i was there, you were there, not as many people were in this  business 25 years ago when we  were at these levels. and we know what a prolonged  bull market looks like. we have had one. it lasted about as long as the  one off the reagan years into  1999, 2000. and trees don't grow to the sky. when we look at valuation, we  look at at the things we do. we're very pictorial. we show this market is  expensive. >> the thing to me is more  worrisome. i don't want a near term  correction, but do you believe  we're expected to see lower  forward returns over another  decade or two. we have heard -- and maybe i  haven't been doing it 25 years,  but i heard a lot about lower  returns in the future that have  never yet pan ned out. do you think this time it's  going to be different? >> as long as i do this, i'm  almost 40 years now. it's getting a the little old  and tedious. the thing i would say about it  is that we're looking at about  6% returns for the 2035. we get there through various  measures such as equity risk  premium, which would take a long time to explain. the price earnings rash owe will drop about 18 times. the earnings will comfortably  double. they have doubled every ten  years for decades. there's nothing we see that  would lead to another double. so double the earnings. take the multiple down. you're look ing at a 6% return r 10 years including dividends  reinvested. so price only, maybe 4. that's not going to make a lot  of baby boomers and post baby  boomers retirement plans whole. so investing is about to get a  lot more difficult. >> if the multiple is okay  because we're the best horse in  the global markets and the  companies are going to get more  product i-thanks to ai, i don't  know if i want to say expansion, but it hangs in there. >> there's no doubt that the ai, which is more evolutionary than  revolutionary. it's a better way to use the  data we already had on the  internet. the internet was revolutionary. fiberoptics was revolutionary. and so this has been hyped up. i don't think it lends itself to the monopolies that allow the  enormous returns, both cash and  earnings, in tech companies. in other words, having ai  position is probably better for  society than it is for a  monopolist like social media  meta or search alphabet. it's going to be interesting to  watch this general purpose  technology develop. but so far to me, it looks ","Category: Macro

Bipartisan bill aims to let small businesses hedge commodity costs: Senators Shaheen and Cassidy,2024-09-25 19:30:42+00:00,5,mjXuD2nXZYA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjXuD2nXZYA,"companies do, specifically hedge the cost of such kmod day tys as lumber, electricity and others. here to discuss the helping  small business thrive act is  senator shaheen and senator  cassidy of louisiana. both joining us now from capitol hill. both to see you joining us  together. i'll throw a jump ball out  there. how would this program work in  the case of small business that  buys a lot of gasoline? let's say it's a construction  contractor. give me an example and either  one of you can go first. >> first of all, as you point  out, small businesses are  critical to the economy. so what we want to do is to  provide every opportunity for  those small businesses to  succeed. one of the challenges is they  can't hedge their costs of  commodities. we did a small business field  hearing in new hampshire a  couple weeks ago. when i heard from those small  businesses is energy costs were  a huge challenge. this bill would allow small  businesses under the oversight  to hedge commodity costs. it gives them the kind of  advantage that large businesses  now have. >> in other words, senator  cassidy, the small business  would be able to lock in a price for a commodity for a set period of time guaranteeing that price. if the price went up, they would spend it. they would have to pay that  higher price, but then magically money would appear for them. from the small business  administration, you'd get a  rebate because you locked in at  a lower price. it wouldn't have to occur for  that. they may be paying $3.50 for  jell fuel. so they are paying a little  extra. ? the price of the jet fuel goes  to $4, they are held harmless. they can do that because they  have massive buying power. small businesses, and we're  speaking businesses 500 or don't have that. so one mechanism would be a  cooperative where small business were able the to come together  and have the buying power as a  unit that southwest has by  itself. and with that, they would pay a  little extra on the front end,  but they would hedge in case  there's a future increase. keep in mind, a significant  portion of small businesses will go bankrupt within the first  five years because they are  operating on thin margins. we're trying to say you can make a business plan that allows you  to survive the sudden increase  in the price of commodity that  could not be anticipated. >> how much would this  potentially cost? all of these plans, your  proposal, a lot of what we have  heard from both of the  candidates for president, they  all sound good and sound useful  and they would help people, but  i'm wondering at what point it  matters what we're spending when we have such high debt. >> the way i laid it out, which  the buying power of businesses  across different industries is  is kpiened shouldn't cost a heck of a lot. by the way, on the hedging,  there's going to be an up side  and a downside. so someone initially in the way  of mostly occurs is able to buy, but they are paying extra on the upside. they pay less on the downside. i don't think we have to talk  about the cost of this as being  prohibitive. but if it is, senator shaheen  and i help negotiate the bill. we know how to bring something  in where it's acceptable  politically, but has an  incredible impact in terms of  the economy. >> this is a pil","Category: Macro

Key takeaways:
* The Helping Small Business Thrive Act is discussed by Senators Shaheen and Cassidy to provide small businesses the ability to hedge commodity costs.
* The act would allow small businesses to lock in prices for commodities for a set period, protecting them from future price increases.
* Small businesses often operate on thin margins, and the ability to hedge commodity costs would help them survive unexpected price spikes.
* The senators suggest that the cost of such a program may not be prohibitive, as it can be structured to have both upside and downside protections.
* The focus is on empowering small businesses to compete with larger businesses that have greater buying power in hedging commodity costs."

PayPal expands services to allow merchants to buy and sell crypto: CNBC Crypto World,2024-09-25 19:16:09+00:00,13,ObKKwofq-KA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObKKwofq-KA,"today cftc chair roston benham pushes back on election betting platforms that use crypto caroline ellison faces a 2-year prison sentence for her role in ftxs collapse and paypal's jose fernandez deponte breaks down the company's new initiative to let merchants buy and sell crypto welcome to cmc's crypto world i'm brennan gomez crypto markets mix this morning with bitcoin and ether holding pretty much flat by noon eastern bitcoin inched half a percentage point higher trading at $63,500 while ether slipped by half a percent to $2,600 a polygon's paul token popped 2.5% to 41 also take a quick look at cipher mining that stock is up more than 15% by around midday and up 33% in the past 2 days after mccory initiated coverage of the stock with an outperform rating okay let's talk about the top stories for today and let's stick with the markets professional cap management founder and ceo anthony pompano joined squawkbox this morning to discuss his optimistic outlook for bitcoin as fed policy shifts if we look at that fed interest rate cut bitcoin is the best performing asset so far gold and oil futures are kind of second um there's a new study that just came out from linn alden and sam gallagan that uh said bitcoin is the most sensitive asset when it comes to global liquidity and so 83% of the time bitcoin moves with global liquidity it's more than s&p or any other asset and so if you look at not just the interest rate cuts now m2 money supplies expanding and also we have cuts going on in china and elsewhere and so i think that bitcoin ends up being a big winner whenever we get kind of cheap money float uh flooding into the system and it feels like we just went through this big regime change right we were tightening everyone was trying to kind of drain liquidity from the system now we're going to go the other way and so bitcoin should be a big winner here for the next couple months he also discussed bitcoin trading activity and how he sees it as an indicator of whether the currency is having a bull run in bull markets if you look on chain basically you know you go through a bare market everyone buys up bitcoin they hold on real tight they don't move it for a year or two and then as you get into a bull market price goes up and there's kind of a clearing people start to sell their bitcoin into that bull market we have started to see a little bit of selling of bitcoin as we kind of broke over $60,000 earlier this year but still more than 50% of all bitcoin is being held you know for over a year and not moving on chain which i think is probably the best signal next cftc chair russ benham also joined squawkbox this morning to discuss us election betting and the agency's position on sites that allow them i don't think there's necessarily a question that there is merit to the the price discovery function of these markets but really what the commission has been saying for over a decade now is that these markets are illegal under current law and we have you know essentially pushed that towards what we're dealing with right now with these two markets but i would say what i've said multiple times is this pulls the cftc into the role of being an election cop because if there is manipulation of these markets if someone does take a position long or short which would essentially be on a c candidate and then potentially puts out news that's not necessarily true this could spiral into a situation where you have manipulation of elections earlier this month the agency lost a legal battle against prediction market ci over election betting markets which the cftc appealed and warned that an explosion in election gambling will harm the public interest when asked about how the cftc might handle offshore betting sites available to americans before the us election benam did not rule out taking enforcement action this is the enforcement mechanism of our agency we have to build a case we have to get the facts we have to allege the facts we have to go to a court so we we do things in order we do things with a very sort of particular process um and we don't hesitate so if there are us investors us customers being offer derivatives without the entity being registered with us or letting us know then we're going to bring an enforcement cas these platforms which sometimes use crypto tokens for placing bets have gained popularity over the months as we head toward the election as of this morning this year's presidential election has $1 billion on the line on poly market a prediction betting site that the agency has fined before we reached out to poly market for comment but did not hear back right away and last caroline ellison the ex-girlfriend of sam bankman freed and former ceo of alam research faced sentencing in federal court yesterday crypto world's mackenzie sigalos was at the courthouse and has more caroline ellison the ex-girlfriend of sam bakman freed former ceo of alam research has been sentenced to 24 months in in prison and then 3 years of probation after that also ordered to pay $ 11 billion in forfeiture this is a culmination of almost two years worth of cooperating with the government federal regulators and the ftx bankruptcy estate to help them piece together lost assets carolyn signed a plea agreement in december of 2022 and since then has been helping prosecutors build their case against sam bitman free the founder of ftx she was a big part of his sentencing both sam bakman freed and caroline ellison found guilty of sever different charges carolyn pled out to those charges sam was found guilty by a jury in november he faces 25 years behind bars also 11 billion in forfeiture carolyn getting two years because of her cooperation judge kaplan and a usa danielle sassoon both citing just how instrumental her testimony was to putting sam behind bars and helping to explain the scope of the ftx fraud still this is a lot more than the three years that the probation department had recommended ahead of sentencing judge kaplan making it clear that just because caroline was a big cooperator and sam bankman freed's conviction it wasn't a get out of jail free card all right for our main story paypal is launching a new service to let merchants buy hold and sell cryptocurrency this comes as the company already lets personal accounts get into the asset class earlier this week mckenzie sagalo spoke to jose fernandez deponte who leads the company's blockchain crypto and digital cryptocurrency unit to learn more so paypal for the first time ever is enabling business accounts to buy hold and sell cryptocurrency walking through the launch and what it means for merchants using your platform well mcken as you know we have been involved in digital curren is now for the best part of the last four years we have been active on stable coins for about a year or so uh but until now only our consumer accounts were able to hold and interact with our stable coin on our platform what we are enabling now for the first time is for merchants to be able to interact with it as well is been one of the features that has been the most demanded by our merchants over the last year we take it to be a very good sign that the business the appetite of business is to interact with these new payment instruments so have you heard a desire from businesses to utilize crypto and do you see real demand from customers who want to pay merchants with cryptocurrencies so those are two different questions and and definitely we do hear demand on the merchant side for cheaper and faster and and instant settlement of payments and they do see the value of stable coins and other digital currencies as a way to get in there i don't think and we have said this for quite a while that consumers in most of the western markets and the us in europe will be doing mainstream e-commerce funded by stable coins right away if you look at the use of the stable coins these days is mostly for crypto trading and mostly for crossb payments i do think that we will continue to see a stable coins for payments cross border and especially on b2b payment use cases so a lot of the demand that we see from merchants are companies who want to play to pay other their suppliers in something that that sett consistently and and is low cost and chief financial officers that have complex treasury operations and they want to make sure that they can move money around the world quickly and cheaply now is this just for us merchants for now it is just for us merchants yes do you see an opportunity abroad i mean lots of countries and regions around the world are more crypto literate than the us you were just uh chatting about that a minute ago this desire for international settlement stable coins being a big part of that narrative do you see a path to capturing business from merchants who are looking to integrate crypto payment options at checkout uh we do see that as as i said we still that we see that mostly on the b2b use case right away there there is uh value in being able to aggregate demand from consumers who are overseas but they lack a credit card international credit card instrument and we see people in asian markets and latin american markets who want to buy from us merchants but they lack the traditional payment methods to do that if you see most of the retail payment activity that you see these days is that aggregation from consumers offshore who want to buy from from us merchants on the merchant side however that that has a number of different ways we will see appetite from merchants outside of the us who want to pay suppliers in the us by they lack access to hard currency $2 dolls in their home markets and that does not require that they have a paypal account out there remember that the way we think about our stable coin is like a tokenized version of the paypal balance that people have used for 20 years but now you you can interact with it without having a paypal account and you can send it outside the the paypal ecosystem so even if only merchants in the us right now will be able to hold the stable coin and send it out merchants outside the us will be able to interact with the stable coin because it's already available in more than 20 exchanges and wallets all over the world okay so you and i spoke in august of last year right after your team had launch paypal's us dollar peg stablecoin py usd certainly not the easiest thing to get off the ground it's my understanding that it took you guys multiple years to get regulators on board even though you were working with paxos a company that had already done this before so now you're more than a year in who's using your stable coin and how has it been going so far it has been going really well as you remember when we spoke last year the whole idea behind our stable coin is that we wanted to see an stable coin that is designed for commerce and payments as as i said earlier the vast majority of the market cap that you see out there now is is for crypto trading we are less interested in that side of the house and we look at the market cap of stable coins but especially we look at the onchain transfer volume because we want our stable coin to be us for used for what we call value motion more than value in rest we we do care that the stable coin is moving and and changing hands in that sense we are very very satisfied with the progress if you look at inside the paypal ecosystem we continue to deploy that on some of our franchise we we know that the uniqueness of our stable coin is the the ability to connect with the more than 400 consumer million consumers more than 35 million merchants in our ecosystem is the only stable coin that is supported inside paypal and bemo holders of that stable coin inside paypal can already buy a checkout at millions of merchants uh we deploy that on zoom our remittance business so and and it's a very clear value for folks who are sending money back home to support their loved ones so if they fund the remittance in a stable coin they don't pay any fees we are now enabling it for business accounts we enable that we establish support for ens we think that is important to remove friction so that people can send to human readable addresses and we have seen a really really nice adoption in the market outside of paypal most of the more relevant wallets out there support the coin deploying on solana was a big plus for us is a really good protocol for for payments and as we said it's available in many of the exchanges worldwide so very very satisfied with with the progress obviously we're we're still getting started purely looking at market cap py usd hit a billion dollars at the end of august it's down to around $724 million nearly 30% plunge here now we haven't seen tether or usdc have a drop that steep not even when tether deped do you see that as any cause for concern and do you have any insight into the dynamics there not at all i i don't think it's a cause for concern if you look at the evolution has been a little bit of czo with an upward trend and i think that we will see volume coming up and and coming down but but consistently in the long term er going up it is a little bit of low of small numbers when you have a smaller base uh is obviously a smaller market shifts can drive the volume up and up and down when we look at the unchain transfer volume though the the amount of the stable coin that has been changing hands every month we see that going steadily up which is the metric that we are most focused on okay that's all we have for crypto world today we'll be back again tomorrow and we'll see you then [music]","Category: Crypto

[ no audio ] i was thinking maybe we'll  get -- we'll fix that in a  second. sam, we'll turn to you with a  similar question. to explain a little bit about  how and why these glasses and  have kind become a sleeper hit,  haven't they? >> i agree with barton. i think on a short-term  perspective, the ai story,  specifically on advertising is  enormous, and just an infinite  wins that will stack up for meta over the upcoming short term  years. but mark zuckerberg is long-term committed and willing to be  patient through the hard cycles. so we have seen the ray bands,  which are fabulous, the first  version was okay. the second version is a hit,  it's great. this is not a one cycle story. this is going to be a  multi-cycle story. so the way i put it, ai is the  short term story, but what  you're seeing is a long-term  focused, patient company and a  long-term, patient ceo. >> barton, if we can hear you  now, go ahead. we were talking about is it  really the hardware and some of  these new announcements powering the stock, or is it literally as simple as how ai has been better optimizing their ad low? >> sure. i think it's the latter. their advertising has been on  fire. that's why the stock's been on  fire. you know, they're huge, and  they're taking share, and nobody really does that. and they're crediting ai for  improving return on ad spend  from improving user engagent. they're deploying ai and they're a use case of ai improving your  business. that's way ahead of the pack. that's where the excitement is. the devices, the reality  segment, is where the concern is among investors. they lost cumulatively since  they started breaking out,  nearly $60 billion, on pace to  lose $17 billion this year, a  little larger than what they  lost last year. and there's no one on wall  street who looks at that and  says yeah, you're going to get a great return on that investment  right now. it seems like something a  founder controlled company can  do. that said, they're losing a lot  of money but the devices are  starting to click. the ray bands are interesting. and so that's, i think, why cnbc and others are looking more  closely at what they're  announcing, because these  devices are starting to  resonate. the whole category was validated to a degree by apple moving in  with vision pro and snap  continuing to lead. >> i take your point about the  glasses more broadly. we all left the product  category. no one was that impressed what  snap announced the other day  that apple vision pro goggles  haven't been a great seller. you said you like the stock in  spite of their investment in the glasses, not because of it. but sam, these feel like a  breakout hit. what separates them from the  other eye hardware that we have  seen or are they going to be a  flash in the pan or a more  durable product category? >> they've gone to the point of  the consumer device. i climbed the grand tetones last week using them. it took great photos is. that the killer thing, are we  there? no. for the next several years, the  story is going to be ai  optimization, which is a massive freight train that meta is best  positioned to take advantage of. but mark's in this for the  long-term. when you think out ten years  plus, the market doesn't care  about. i'm glad they're making these  investments and i expect to see  a lot of long-term success. >> sam, is it a black eye for  apple that meta has all the buzz around the headset and apple  doesn't? >> it must be driving them  crazy. they launched the vision pro  with enormous fanfare, supposed  to be tim dock's big win. they couched it like look, i  have one next to me. i think it's probably the most  expensive device per minute of  consumer use in history. meta, they continuously grind  and grind and making them  better. i would say they're alread","Category: Technology

WisdomTree CEO cautions investors against fixating on 2025 until the election outcome is known,2024-09-25 17:16:23+00:00,5,Zp2tsj2SnBg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp2tsj2SnBg,"according to the latest metrics, also noting inflows were offset  by jaut flows in its japan fund, as the fed cuts rates, where are investors putting their money? let's talk more about the flows. joining us, jonathan steinberg. wisdom tree also launched a new  platform to integrate  decentralized finance for  institutional investors. welcome back. nice to see you, jonathan. how are you? >> i'm good. how have the flows changed since the fed? >> well, i think you have our  professor siegal on all the  time, and very happy to see 50  basis points to reduce the  chance of recession. still, i think there's a  tremendous amount of money  sitting on the sidelines, but  the lower rates might signal a  shift in sentiment to value  stocks. but i would caution your viewer  not to get too fixated yet on  2025, until they know the  outcome of the election. >> why? w how do you think that's going to change the market? >> it's not just a presidential, but also the senate and the  house. these candidates have  extraordinarily different views  on the economy. so will the trends be similar to the last four years or will they be very different? >> i think you've got to take  the election into account, and  this last cut was very close to  the election. >> but are you starting to see  certain moves -- it's hard to  tell, right, what -- without  knowing which way congress is  going to go, and without having  a top of specifics on either  side about policies, are you  seeing any moves already? >> no, i think people are  cautious, the polls are tight,  so you just don't know which way to position. so i think it's very hard to  predict right now. that's why you have $6 trillion  in money market funds. >> it's amazing, jonathan --  it's brian. when you talk about $6 trillion  in money market funds, and  where's all the money coming  from? i'm sorry it's such a macro,  weird, probably overly basic  question, but where is all of  this cash? we keep hearing about how much  there really is. and i guess justice i'm just  dense and trying to figure out  where that money continues to  flow from. >> i don't -- i can't really  answer that question for you pip mean, people are moving money  around, certainly, from  different instruments. but equity flows have been  strong. fixed income has been a  challenge. short duration has done for the. floating rate treasuries up  until very recently has been a  place where the money is parked. but people are very much waiting and seeing. and again, such different  policies that it's -- we see --  the financial intermediary, and  the retail investor are paused  to see how the election turns  out. >> you've got the new  centralized finance product. it involves stable coins,  tokenization. can you and jonathan, in very  layman's terms, explain what  this product does that the  market -- what hole -- what need is this filling versus what  already exists? because let's be -- it is, i  will say, even to me, it's  fairly complex stuff. or at least it seems to be. >> so this is wisdom tree's  third block chain platform. so the first one was a  tokenization factory. so we manage 112 billion  intransparent exposures, and the new wrapper would be this  digital wrapper called  tokenization. the next one we launched was  wisdom tree prime, our  direct-to-consumer application,  where savings, investing, and  payments will be consolidated,  and the convenience and  flexibility and savings that you will achieve with your money  will be quite revolutionary over time. the third one that we just  launched, wisdom tree connect,  allows for the community to  access our real-world tokens. so like our money market fund,  and the to access it while  staying on chain, which for many of the consumer, that is their  preference. these are the early days of  tokenization. but what you are going to see is a replatforming of financial  services on to the block chain  for convenience, for seein","Category: Macro, Technology

please i'm cnbc producer cla ododi today on squadpod legendary investor leon cooperman on the markets i think stocks are the best place to be i would avoid bonds and what he thinks investors are looking for in the 2024 presidential election we have two candidates running for office neither one talks about the deficit or the buildup of debt and the world descends on new york for the united nations general assembly defense tech company palente teers mike gallagher on president biden's final un address and hotspots around the world i would like to propose a new theory of international relations which is called winning you have to win the war in order to impose the terms of the peace plus visa sued over high fees boeing's best and final and the staying power of the classics you want a quick boomer update yeah we turn to you for that that's why i'm here it's wednesday september 25th 2024 squawk pod begins right now stand becky by in 3 2 one q please good morning everybody and welcome to squawkbox right here on cnbc we're live from the nasdaq market site in time square i'm becky quick along with joe kernin and andrew ros sorin here we go wednesday it's hump day meantime let's talk about the department of justice now suing visa accusing it of propping up an illegal monopoly over de debit payments by imposing exclusionary agreements on partners and smothering upstart firms the agency says uh it also goes on to say that visas moves over the years have resulted in american consumers and merchants paying billions of dollars in additional fees it said those fees far exceed what it could have charged in a competitive market and were passed along to consumers affecting the price of nearly everything the visa called uh the the everything that visa touched now visa calls uh the case meritless the company's general counsil saying quote today's lawsuit ignores the reality that visa is just one of many competitors in a debit space that is growing with entrance who are thriving and um it's going to be an interesting one to see this one you need to explain it to me again because i i i would think that i mean my kids have all these other ways of paying are they in sare if you're looking and i don't know everything apple pay are those are they not are they just again narrowing what they're looking at to to the so this case unlike a lot of the cases where i've said oh it looks like maybe you agree yeah it's more complicated because a lot of the feature set when you're debiting cards off of this right you think you're doing it through some other service you're using their network you're really using them you're still using visa bingo and so that is the real question now you i you're a bitcoin fan and maybe you think that ethereum becomes a a payment mechanism and maybe there's other ways to do it but in terms of debiting not credit not credit but debit these guys own a huge portion of the market i mean there's still2 trillion is it monopolistic practices that allow them to do the justice depart they always say but is it true i know violating cost on those it's lower than it is on credit card systems for sure i mean i don't know i've noticed places over the summer where it'll charge you 3% or a couple of bucks if you use your credit card if you use debit it won't charge you anything so that speaks to the lower rates there they should really be looking at the credit card stuff probably but there there are about $2 trillion dollar in us transactions that go over debit card systems that are not going over visa but visa does have a massive network and they've made these partnerships with all these companies like square and other to use those partnerships to use their network so that's where the justice department comes in because i get the frequent flower miles that are useless but for some reason i still think that i get them that i need them i don't use a debit card and also you don't want to use a debit card for like a big purchase well you don't the reason i don't use debit card yeah you don't want to use it so somebody gets your debit card numbers i i never put my pin numbers in um for that reason because i did get ripped off at one point that's what i mean yeah i did for why i use a credit card for different reasons which is just both the points and the services that you don't get with the debit card that's what it and i've got a like one and a half% cash back thing for everything i put but more but more to the point if you lose your thing if you break your product whatever all of those things that's the credit card will protect you on that's not protected but you at this point think that there may be some mer see i think this is meritless again you think there is you think there's some merit to this that there they may have a little bit more complicated these actually stocks up i mean they're like rolling their eyes they you know stock traders at another frivolous doj suit that's not going anywhere we see whether it goes anywhere i think it take a long long time but by the way credit card the credit card industry is a i mean credit card visa mastercard amx now you could say that that's not a monopoly per se but the way that there are these there have been arguably monopolistic practices throughout and credit card business the financial system in this way is a i keep using the phone as the example this credit card um which tells you something too which tells you something but except that it's going through the phone through the card is like one of the great taxes on the system i mean it's actually quite incredible i mean it really is a three 2 to 3% tax on the on everything you touch every you talk about tariffs the credit card is a great like tax tariff on everything and the question is whether you believe you're getting enough service for the 2 or 3% that you're paying more on everything you still got a diner club i do not traveler sh does anyone i do not but just think about it go look at the market capit a visa think about how much value think think about no i'm just saying it's a incredibly successful company and what are they what are they're doing they're helping you with the payment which is valuable to some extent but the question is is it should it be val it's on two fronts by the front the doj is looking into this on two fronts one is the loyalty fees loyalty discounts that you get if you're a big vendor if you push everything through their network the idea of a disloyalty fee if you go elsewhere and give some of your business to somebody else the other is the partnerships that struck up with all these f i make a lot more deposits than payments just my life is mostly all deposits very few uh buy some food it's about it right gas you p pay cash for gas though obviously it's because you get save 10 a gallon the union representing thousands of striking boeing factory workers said late yesterday that a survey showed its members were overwhelmingly against boeing's latest offer which it described as its best and final offer earlier in the day uh boeing said it would extend the timeline for a vote in the new contract after the re the union said you know no um and rejected the initial friday deadline it's like why friday we're going to we're going to be you know sucking you guys dry for weeks on this strike boing's uh latest proposal included a 30-day or 30% pay gain in the restoration of some performance bonuses uh the union's been seeking a 4 40% pay hike and the restoration of a pension plan defined benefit pension plan that was eliminated in its contract a decade a gh striking workers are are set to miss their first paycheck as a result of the strike uh this thursday we saw as we have said other unions get numbers like that when they held out and i just think it's going to be hard to convince these guys to say where's mine like you know didn't some auto workers got the 40 and they after being out for a long time they did um philbo said yesterday that the pension wasn't the biggest sticking i don't think that's a negotiating well i i don't know that seems like a it have that i i can't imagine there's 10 million people who have pensions in the united states today there's 90 million who have 401ks um but that is a huge point and the idea that they're not talking is probably the bigger point the union management is is mad or union leadership is mad that management went around them um but the union leadership has been completely feckless in terms of being able to deliver anything at this point either they recommended a deal that 96% of their their membership turned down federal judge ruling that a new york city law that requires food delivery companies to share customer data with restaurants is unconstitutional the judge sided with door dash grubhub and uber eat saying the law violates the first amendment by improperly regulating commercial speech the law was adopted in 2021 as as new york city tried to help restaurants recover from the pandemic the companies argued that the law violated customers privacy rights and was also harmful to their own businesses since restaurants could potentially use that customer data for marketing purposes it's an interesting case guys because i don't know how much you focused on this this is the pl this is the platform story you know how much does apple know and how much does apple or grubhub in this case or google or any of these guys need to share with the underlying businesses that are using their services you're buying products from whomever but you're doing it through another platform by the way as a consumer do i have a say with this i don't want you sharing my information with anybody if i want my information given to someone i'll give it to them zero yeah no that's not true what i mean yes and no what happens is you log on to the you log onto the thing and you consent to some screen that you can't read but the problem yeah you can't read it and then if you don't consent to it you can't get in which is the biggest ripoff on this my car is still sending me notifications that it is sending out information on me again even though i've repeatedly asked them to stop doing this and the dealer can't even tell me how to get out of this like the amount of information that we're giving away you have no option of not doing unless you don't buy a car or don't sign up for an app or don't do any of these things glad i'm really boring and there's really nothing to get from me yeah watch out if they're watching your driving my driving's better lately i've had some issues you know people you have mellowed uh in terms of in terms of what you bring out the best than me and a new filing shows that warren buffett's burkshire hathway has sold an additional 863 million dollar in bank of america stock trimming its stake to 105% as long as berkshire holds a stake of more than 10% it has to disclose those trades in the stock within a few days i believe it's three days according to sec rules berkshire began trimming that massive investment back in july even after months of sales the remaining stake is still worth more than $32 billion based on yesterday's close berkshire is still bank of america's largest shareholder and i believe bank of america is still the number three position i think it was number two before behind apple and i think it's number three behind apple and american express at this point you want a quick boomer update just a quick one yeah we turn to you

andrew ros sorin our next guest is a market veteran despite the daily new highs we've been seeing right now he's says he's less bullish than the consensus lee cooperman joins us right now for a wide ranging and exclusive conversation on the markets the fed and much more of course lee is the chairman and ceo of omega family office and lee it's been a while since we've seen you it's very good to have you on today thank you it's pleasure to be with you how you doing uh we're doing good we're doing good it's uh 8:15 made it through most of the morning so far um lee let me let me ask you you have been concerned about the market and the heights of the market market for some time you've been warning that that things could take a turn down and that you are less optimistic than others we keep hitting new highs and i just wonder when you think things would potentially be offset i know you're still not convinced that good times are here to stay yeah well i'm very concerned about two things one is uh the debt buildup you we have two candidates running for office neither one talks about the deficit uh or the buildup of debt know in 2017 i think our national debt was $20 trillion and 7 years later it's $34 trillion that's a growth rate far ex as the growth rate of the economy and that's going to be a problem one day we don't know the day which could be a problem probably when we least expected and secondly i would say which kept me involved in the market is after 10year bar and belongs at 3.76 where it is currently there's very little in the market it's valued unless the 3.76 is reflective of a coming recession and um if it's 376 x recession there's very little that's overvalued you know i go back to 1972 nifty50 when uh the the market selling at a much bigger multiple than it's selling at now and the 10 and the ten government bomb was 6 and a half% and in 2000 cisco which was the then present day nvidia was selling 380 times earnings the ten government in 2000 was uh also 6% so at 3.76 there's nothing that's overvalued or very little that's overvalued so has the fed cutting rates pushed you into a position where you're going to be putting a lot more into stocks no i'm reasonably fully invested but i'm invested offbeat merchandise i have a 20% position in a bond that i think the government's behavior is disgraceful i discussed about it before it's a little complicated have about 15% energy given what's going on in the middle east i would think energy uh would be a place to have some money and then i have a lot of special situations so you know i'm not sitting on a lot of cash and i think the fed cutting rates is cutting rates in the short end and i think the long rate is going to go up the 10e rate is going to go up as the fed reduces short rates so you get back to a positive slope fel curve does it make sense to you that the fed cut rates uh just looking at where you see the economy yeah i would say that the short rates are too high relative you know historically the 10e government bond is yielded in line with nominal gdp so if you have real growth of about 2 and a half% you have inflation of two and a half that would be 5% nominal gdp so the 10 year would not be uh overvalued at a 5% yield uh it wouldn't be undervalued i think the rates are going to go higher in the short end you know maybe you get 125 basis points over inflation so the rate doesn't belong at the current level of 5% so i think that the the fed will cut short rates but it's not going to make much of a difference you don't use a short rate to discount a long duration that's it so your concerns about when we will have a problem on our hands just in terms of when people won't buy the government debt um as you said it's probably coming at the the time we least expect it how do you prepare yourself for that well you know i think look i may be too old you take me out behind the bar and shoot me i'm 81 years old uh i've been through a couple of uh you know bubbles 2000 bubble and in 1972 bubble uh in a bare market who he loses least loses loses wins so i would think that it's going to be hard to prepare though i think stocks are the best place to be i would avoid bonds uh and uh you just don't know the timing you just don't know the timing you know uh in 1972 two very civic mined citizens pete peterson and henry f used to run full page ads in the journal in the times alluding the public to the evils of the budget and trade deficit here we are what 50 years later and the only significance has been we have the lowest interest rates in our lifetime now i don't think it's sustainable you know uh we had in the 70s the concept of guns and butter we have guns and butter now we're assisting in fighting two wars and no one's focus on reducing the deficit and uh we're going ul we have crowding out that's my view so i'm i'm very concerned i'm concerned about the election outcome we got two people running for election i don't hear either one of them talking about uh they need to deal with our fiscal issues you know we we got to finance these wars it's uh we're not thinking about and whether the market forces this one day who the hell knows but i think it will and so that leads to my conservatism not outright bearishness but very conservative i think the market at 21 22 times earnings is fully valued and does not allow for the uncertainties that exist that's my view but i'm find plenty of things to do in the market i'll be honest with you i find plenty of things to do but everything i look at uh leads me to be cautious you know everybody talks about stock repurchasing and i would just observe what the wise men does in the beginning the fool does in the end how many billions of dollars of stock you think intel bought back how much billions of dollar stock that bed bond buy back now intel is now on government assistance and bank and you know bed beath of the y the great retailer is in bankruptcy so there's no magic you know you you only make sense to buy back your stock if it's cheap and if you're so far into a bull market maybe and your stock isn't cheap maybe making a mistake lee why don't we talk about the things you are finding to do if you've got 15% in energy because you worry what's happening in the middle east and and think that that will potentially drive energy prices higher where where are you looking where have you invested the most well i have two large positions in two canadian oil and gas companies paramount resources i've own for a while stock yield 7% uh they have virtually no debt they're producing oil at $31 a barrel and they're following a strategy of increasing production so they're going to go from 100,000 barrels a day of production to probably 150,000 over the next few years bringing down their average cost of production so you have a debt-free company with a current dividend yield of about 7% you know i find that's better than cash and another company that is written run by a very smart guy michael rose of uh taline you know one of the largest oil and gas producers in canada stock has a fat divent yield over 5% uh and run by a very smart guy and uh i would think that given what's going on in the middle east there's a risk that oil prices move higher than we think um one that i have a very big position in but it's complicated is a company called the legato which i've talked about in the past sure this this is a travesty of the us government and in terms of their behavior these guys have $40 billion of assets and you can create in the market for a billion dollars at the end of the day they're suing the government for $40 billion and i think that the l has a lot of merit and i think the bonds are totally mispriced that's been years in the making though you've talked to us about about that issue years absolutely but so i have a mark to market loss but you know the bonds the first lean bonds which i have a big position in trade around 15 or 6 16 cents in a dollar that're capitalizing the company a billion dollars the company has a lawsuit get the govern for 40 billion if you read the lawsuit right up front they say we have evidence that the government lied on the oath we have evidence the government is using our spectrum without paying for it and the government has made a sale of the company very difficult they say if you buy legal spectrum you can't do business with the us government now uh i think at the end of the day this case is moving along recently the judge presiding the case is issued a directive to both the companies the government and the company to respond to seven questions and had to respond i think by uh september 8th so they've already responded and if you read the responses they seem to be very much in favor of the company so uh right now i buy the bonds at 15 or 16 i'm getting 178 points of pick interest a year which i realize i worth zero if the coming loses the case if they win the case i'm going to make 85 points of capital appreciation the bonds plus i going to get 17 headit points of interest even if it takes three years i don't mind lee let's talk about what you've said about the election you don't particularly care for either of these candidates do you think it makes a difference who wins in terms of how the stock market will react i think the stock market is reflecting a divided government the stock market is acting like uh whoever wins the presidency the congress will be in a different direction and uh that's possible you know in 1976 i'll be very open even though it's we have a closed voting system in 1976 i did not vote for either trump or clinton i wrote a mitt romney in 2020 i voted for biden there trump whose economic ideas are superior to harris see i i'm a strange bird i work very hard i'm giving away all my money not half i'm giving away all my money so so i'm sympathetic to the people that don't have it and i'm trying to make the world a better place but you know harris is uh you don't know what she stands for it seems to me she wants to give away fish and i'm big on teaching people how to fish i don't want to give away fish you know i want to teach people how to fish big difference and trump he's just a he's a bit of a headcase you know he has 20 people in the past that were part of his administration that were typically very close to him also say they vote for him that he has issues so you know i can't ignore that plus i think i've said in the past that you know uh he uh he mocked the new york times report with sha you learn when you're two years old you don't do that he mocked uh john mccain he was a true war hero in my opinion he mocked nikki haley husband who's serving with honor and distinction in the middle east and he denies having said this but there are people that say say otherwise that he talked about the the heroes that gave up their life in world war ii were suckers that he denies having said that but there's enough other things that you said having said that i've read the democrat platform which is 80 pages long i've read the republican platform which is 22 pages long and the republican platform resonates more with me so my intention is i'm voting strictly republican in the house and the senate but i'm not voting for president because i don't think either candidate is suitable to be president i'm hoping we have a divided government even though at this time we need a unified government we have to work together it's a conundrum lee um i want to thank you for being with us today my pleasure next on sbod the technology and politics of war with a man who's been in a thick of both congressman turned head of defense at paler mike gallaga joins us ukraine october 7th all of these things should have been a massive wakeup call a sput moment for america to rearm reindustrialize we went from being the arsenal of democracy to the dmv of democracy and the sentencing of a key player in the meltdown of crypto platform ftx plus prison politics you have friends that are incarcerated when you know you [music] know you're listening to squa pod here's andrew on tuesday president biden addressed the united nations general assembly and warned that we are at another inflection point in world history i put forward with cutter and egypt to cease fire and hostage deal it's been endorsed by the un security council now is the time for the parties to finalize its terms bring the hostages home and secure security for israel and gaza free of h hamas grip ease the suffering in gaza and end this war jo us right now is mike gallagher head of defense at paler he's a former republican congressman representing wisconsin do you see any path to ending this war well i i think these knee-jerk calls for a ceasefire which the biden administration has been pushing really since october 8th actually bring us further away from an end to a war i would like to propose a new theory of international relations which is called winning you have to win the war in order to impose the terms of the peace and as for any action or resolution the un can take and biden's calls for such a resolution pertaining to a ceasefire we have something called un security council resolution 1701 which calls for complete disarmament of southern lebanon south of the lani river and lebanon and hisbah has not disarmed and israel with remarkable audacity it has actually uh reduced 50% of his bella's uh long- range precision fires and we should support them in that effort and in their efforts to destroy hamas in the south and what's your sense though of what iran does in retaliation well i think i think the the key source of disorder in the region is the fact that iran does not feel deterred and the key problem that the next president whether it's donald trump or kl harris will have to solve is how do we restore a semblance of deterrence in my mind that is supporting the complete destruction of hamas degrading and deterring hisb and then what the united states can uniquely do is actually destroying another terrorist iranian proxy the houi rebels which have completely shut down commerce in and around the sea and we are now on the wrong side of the curve our enemies are counting down the bullets that are in our chamber all of this depends on our ability to rebuild our entire defense industrial base which this conflict and the conflict in eastern europe has revealed as broken right now like is it a purely partisan political talk to to try to uh assign some blame to the biden administration for because he took off the sanctions in february of 2021 the the the un sanction he hasn't enfor the oil they're they're rolling in money in iran right now to be able to fund all these proxies why is that a stretch to say that this was on the biden administration i don't think i don't think it's like a partisan hack attack it's simple cause and effect right it's independent variable dependent variable we delist the houthis we prevent the go our government from selling offensive weapons to the saudis to go after the houthis and what happens they reemerge as a even despite being like a two-bit terrorist organization one capable of attacking the united states navy so i think that's a fair attack but i do think biden's un speech is an opportunity for us to take a step back and assess this administration's overall foreign policy record but the the the the rationale was that the 2015 uh pct that trump exited that this would make it easier to to to get back so that there was like a method to to the appeasement wasn't there but it it didn't work you would say well i think i think objectively iran is closer to sort of a turnkey away from having a nuclear weapon than it was at the start of this administration uh the trump administration i think would argue that a policy of maximum economic pressure was bearing fruit iran's economy is very weak but if you don't if you don't pair that policy with a robust and credible military deterrent in the region it's actually not going to have an effect so that is the challenge going for you i mean would you ascribe anything with putin and and ukraine to saying that we'd be okay with them taking a little bit of uk remember when he said that and then a week later they i think all of these things are connected in the sense that you draw a direct line from the biden administration's decision disastrous decision to withdraw from afghanistan for purely political reasons and that was the president overruling his political or his military advisors i think that had an impact on putin's calculus in eastern europe and on general global disorder and on the deteriorating balance of power in the most important region the indo pacific well back to the middle east with where we are right now and with israel making these incursions into lebanon to try and push hezbollah back with the missile that they launched that hezbollah launched into tel aviv essentially last night i mean one missile the expectation is they have a lot more yeah what happens now because netanyahu's decision to push forcefully where where does that get us and obviously they were dealing with attacks from october 8th coming from hezbollah but where what about now i think the over in political objective in israel is to return israelis to the north of the country that until you actually force a disarmament in key parts of southern lebanon it doesn't have to completely comply with unker 1701 that i mentioned before that's going to be very difficult right you don't want israelis being is this different than before are we closer to an allout war breaking out in the middle well in the middle east you know for the last two decades we're always like on the knife's edge of of an allout war uh again the path to peace in my opinion eventually runs through t you have to deter the primary adversary in the region and the thing that unites the israelis and the reason we're seeing a historic level of rman and cooperation between the israelis and the sunni arab gulf states is because of the shared threat from iran the path to peace is not through peace process issues or the palestinian issues you have to build a regional strategy around deterring iran otherwise nothing else makes if iran had the bomb right now would it be a different situation with with israel right now they seem to be uh they they don't really want to engage to to the full extent that that that they could they've actually shown restraint which doesn't seem to go at all with what you think of when you say iran but they have they waiting it out right they they could be hoping that uh the next administration has a more friendly policy with respect to iran or continues uh to hope that by just merely reviving the lifeless corpse of the obama iran deal that somehow we will have deterrence in the region or more peace middle east which i think the last four years have proven that's not true so i mean we'll see they could just be waiting us out can i just ask a different question about it's it's a political us question uh about who is in the white house and how much no no and how much that person just through jawboning and presence yeah can deter anything meaning there's this sort of idea you hear from former president trump that if he was in in this role none of this would we talk about concrete things like sanction you just mean being crazy i'm not crazy no no just jobing just through sort of force of personality do you believe that through force of personality um alone can change the dynamic internationally in these geopolitical tension points i do i it matters right there's an old saying either attributed to frederick the great or freddy mercury i don't know it's that you know diplomacy without armaments is like music without instrument right it needs to be backed by the credible threat of force but the president's credibility or the perception of presidential power besides the conventional balance of military hard power is the variable that matters most and i do think there's a legitimate question right now as to who is in charge right and i worry particularly about this transition period between the election and january 20th i worry that our adversaries particularly uh the chinese communist party might try to take advantage of that moment particularly if we are internally divided and at war our okay so what do you think how how do you think that would manifest itself you're talking about taiwan now taiwan you actually think that that's on the table come this christmas basically i uh with the caveat that nobody knows what lurks in the the dark mind and heart of xiin ping i have said on your show before that we've entered the window of maximum danger and the minute he thinks he he can actually achieve his lifelong ambition which is to take taiwan by force if necessary he will do it and we are uniquely vulnerable in this period right now again it gets back to the core point you ukraine october 7th all of these things should have been a massive wakeup call a sputnik moment for america to rearm reindustrialize we we went from being the arsenal of democracy to the dmv of democracy where our allies who purchased weapons from us are waiting for years can i ask you this if you think that this country is going to be destabilized effectively in the months of november and december who do you put that on i i the president is in office right he is in in charge right he is still until january 20th we're already there but we're already there now i guess it sounds to me like you were suggesting that there's there could be a period of time in this country yeah where we are genuinely destabilized because people don't know i think you're debate about are you're saying right now because because you don't think that in charge right now with the program is that what you're trying to suggest i think there has saw the debate come on well no no what i'm also what i thought that he was suggesting was that there could be you think it's trump january 6 or something that's right i think that that's a huge part of the destabilizing i'm worried about if there's a president right now what worries me is i think there's an element in both parties right now that is that sort of embracing a more isolationist view of the world right this idea that we know we've had we've had unsatisfying conclusions to wars in iraq and afghanistan there's a lot of skepticism about our ability to continue to support ukraine and therefore the solution is for us to retreat to fortress america time and again history has shown that is a bad look and a bad strategy we need to somehow regain our self-confidence abandon the self-loathing and recognize that we are the good guys there are enemies that are trying to destroy us and our allies and we have to push back aggressively mike gallagher thank you for joining us this morning thank you carolyn ellison has been sentenced now to two years in prison and ordered to forfeit 11 billion for her role in the fraud and conspiracy to ftx ellison was a star witness you may remember the prosecution of her former boyfriend ftx founder s bankman freed the prison term was significantly stiffer though than the recommendation by the federal probation department which proposed three years of supervised release with no time at all behind bars the judge praised ellison for her extensive cooperation with prosecutors but said her criminal sentence needed to deter other potential bad actors from committing fraud it's an interesting turn of events if you think about all of these uh issues only because i i imagine that when she decided to turn state's evidence she thought you know what i'm going to somehow get get off and well she was probably told that they would recommend that correct and well by the way there's another case going on uh with ryan salem you might remember where he said that he only u spoke on be that he only worked effectively with the prosecutors and settled the case because they weren't going to go after um his partner um and now apparently they're going after his partner and he's saying look you need to undo this entire thing because i made a deal based on a thing do they put that in writing when they when they make those deals or is it just like a not in a week i don't think they put it in in writing ne i guess they can't because it's up to the judge's discretion eventually to go and do it and i understand the judge's point that you want to deter future fraud but i i think the other side of that is you don't want to deter people from cooperating with the state particularly on difficult cases that you wouldn't be able to to prosecute without some of these witnesses and it's somewhat related story multiple reports say that sean colmes is living in the same unit of like a dorm of brooklyn jail i can confirm this you need to say the other yeah it's sam bankman freed yeah you were over there or something or you got i'm just saying i know yeah you you have friends that are incarcerated when you know you know you're right the mcc wow they're uh they re sleeping no uh they're in this dormatory style thing i've seen it i visited once at la jail the scariest thing everybody's these guys are not roommates per se they're in a unit yeah i get it um beds it's very bizarre uh group of other defendants assigned to the same section comes a pleading not guiling guilty to charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking but the judge denied bail 50 million uh saying it concerns uh that comes would attempt to witness tamper comes was assigned to the special house in unit that often holds the high-profile inmates bankman freed has been housed in that jail since last year one a judge ruled that he had violated conditions of his release and revoked his bail he was sentenced to 25 years in prison but remains in the brooklyn jail while he is pursuing uh an appeal you have more details not that many more details just just what we know for the most part wow but no all i'd say is is it's not a detail typically this is it shouldn't be surprising this is what when you have a high-profile usually it's like judges policemen uh celebrities are always put in the same groups of people by the way sometimes the worst defenders because they're actually always worried that the other inmates are going to hurt them that's that's the issue typically so that the reason why often times you'll see certain groups of people that you know of being high-profile in one unit is because they the goal is to protect them from the only thing i would say is you know the things that sean comes is being held for are like violent crimes right no no they're holding them on racketeering no no but often times the highest profile people often sometimes white collar people are t are typically put with what may be sometimes considered the most violent offenders because of the view that by way if you're the head of a gang you're often in that group because they need to keep that person away from the rest of the population it's a very interesting sort of dynamic inside prisons having more spent lots of time reporting on yeah white collar crime in prison often times you're shocked by the people who are in there at the same time in there at the same time at the same place that's our podcast for today squawkbox is hosted by joe kernin becky quick and andrew rosin you have

Google files EU antitrust complaint against Microsoft over cloud competition,2024-09-25 16:24:12+00:00,4,hTV1szAiwvk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTV1szAiwvk,"complaint against rival  microsoft in the eu, accusing it of unfairly locking its clients  into using its cloud product. for today's ""tech check,""  deirdre bosa on how this could  be the latest in recently  renewed scrutiny against  microsoft, deirdre, and  interesting that google is  turning the tables on the eu  after so often it's the target. >> and it's also interesting you used the word ""renewed,"" that's  a good word to describe it,  because microsoft was the target of regulators in the late '90s  and early 2000s, but it's  enjoyed a more under the radar  status. call it the anti-trust  advantage. the eu complaint is another sign that that advantage could be  eroding. and that microsoft could face  more pressure, not just from  regulators, but its tech peers,  as well. google, which is facing a  mountain of legal battles on its own, it's going on the offense  here, using its smaller player  status to argue that microsoft  has a monopoly in the space. it has been an effective  strategy in the eu for others,  much smaller companies, like  slack, which filed a complaint  against microsoft's bundling of  teams with office 365. there was also epic games that  went after apple and google's  app store policies, both gained  concessions in the form of  fines, or the lowering of walled gardens, arguably more  important. google's complaint is unique in  that it pits giant against  giant, making it very  high-profile. a high-profile fight that could  raise flags for american  regulators. as you well know, sarah, because you talked to her the other day, europe's anti-trust chair was in d.c. this week to meet with her  u.s. counterparts, and we've  seen that cases there can  inspire similar investigations  or lawsuits here. and so far, the regulators in  the u.s., the doj and the ftc,  they have anti-trust cases out  against google, meta, and  amazon. there isn't one against  microsoft, although regulators  are poking around. the ftc has opened an anti-trust deal. as we've pointed out many times, it's forward price-to-earnings  multiple. it's the only one of the meg 7  that's below 20 times. microsoft, as you can see here,  it is well above that. it's above 30 times earnings. and it could have room to fall,  because as we've seen, guys, the market in, i would say, just  recent years, maybe the last  year, only have really begun to  price in some of the anti-trust  scrutiny. >> deirdre, do we know what the  market share is of microsoft and cloud computing? >> well, we know that worldwide, it is a second. and you know, a pretty  significant second to amazon's  aws. aws has been the leader here for a really long time. of course, microsoft is going to argue that. but what google takes issue with is again this idea of a walled  garden that has just been such  an effective argument,  especially over in europe. the idea that microsoft can  bundle all of these things  together, because it is such a  strong player in enterprise. and you know, what google  argues, can unfairly punish  companies if they want to switch cloud computing. dp goog","Category: Technology

Why Evercore cut its Brent crude price target,2024-09-25 16:18:47+00:00,4,X5pls7Ok3LU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5pls7Ok3LU,"maybe. core isi cutting its price  estimate for crude oil. they now see brent crude at  about $70 next year. tha overseas. so if brent is $70, that would  put american oil, wti, in the  mid-60s range. evercore concerned about rising  supply, slowing demand growth. and the analyst behind that note joining us now, evercore isi  senior managing director, steve  richardson. steve, somebody attracts this  stuff pretty closely, not as  closely as you, but i look at  the balance of trade, and we  have never, ever, had traders  this bearish on oil. at least on paper. >> yeah, absolutely, brian. the market is set up incredibly  short. and i think this is the most  interesting thing right now, in  oil markets, is just the  divergence between some of the  near-term fundamentals, which  frankly, you know, we think the  bearishness is a little  overstated, versus this fear  around 2025. and i think that's kind of the  duality that you're dealing with in oil markets. but, you know, simply said, you  know, you mentioned it. demand has disappointed. but i don't think it's as bad as what the open interest  indicates. >> here's what's weird about  that. people, i get it, the oil  markets can be confusing. we are still expected to grow  global demand next year,  correct? by about 900,000 barrels a day,  but that growth is less than the expected growth and the  historical growth rate. so what's weird is that demand  still growing. it's not falling, it's growing. but i guess with opec, and  potentially moving things back  to where they were before on  december 1st, opec could add  more barrels to the market than  china might add, in terms of  demand? >> that's absolutely right,  brian. i think what's -- as you  mentioned, on growth, we can  still see some negative  revisions to growth  expectations. but what's interesting is, and  the data clearly shows this, is  if the global economy is growing and things are still, you know,  muddling through, and we're  clearly in a soft landing camp  at the firm, you really haven't  broken, you know, the global  economy's exposure to  hydrocarbons. and i think what you will  continue to see is that growth. now, what you mentioned on 25 is very real, opec came out this  summer, and said they want to  bring back some of the barrels  they took off the market last  year. that scared the market. and you have this issue, which  is non-opec likely grows around  a million barrels next year, if  you look at what's going on in  the u.s., and what's going on in latin american. so you really need for '25, and  this is the issue that people  are facing, is for opec to stand pat. and that's what people want to  stress test and certainly our  investors want to discuss is,  what are the chances that that  doesn't happen. >>teve, why does nobody seem  to be worried about the mideast  risk? >> it's a good question, sarah. i think -- a couple of things. if i would have told you that  there would be confrontations,  certainly with iran, when we  originally had gaza last year, i think people were really focused on whether or not this becomes a regional conflict and what it  means fs for flows. there's excess supply across  non-opec. inventories are certainly by no  means bloated, but they're  healthy. and so i think this is the  market saying, you know, that  there's plenty of oil out there  on the water and elsewhere, and  so, you know, if we lost half a  million or a million barrels ","Category: Macro

Key takeaways:

"Fed's inflation fight may be a bigger battle than we thought, says Morgan Stanley's Jim Lacamp",2024-09-25 15:50:23+00:00,5,_ZgDKOAeC4w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZgDKOAeC4w,"consumer cyclicals have gotten  some relief. so i think it's a mixed picture. maybe we still call it  indecisive in the last few days. >> okay. thank you, mike. >> yeah. >> mike santoli. >> great stuff on a friday. with the s&p hitting a new high  this morning, our next guest  thinks the stage is set for a q4 rally. joining us now is morgan  stanley, senior portfolio  manager. jump lecamp, you like how the  fundaments look, jim? >> when you look at the economy, sarah, and put it in the context of a fed rate-cutting cycle, the economy doesn't yet appear to be heading into a recession. and that's been a little bit of  a relief for the markets. you look at this half a point  rate cut, and you look at the  history, when the federal  reserve board cuts rates into a  soft landing, historically, the  market does very well for the  following year. average gain of about 17%. when they cut rates into a  recession, you have an on  average of 15% drop. so right now what the market is  saying, probably a soft landing. i think that's the best way to  put it is probably. and we still have issues, and i  would argue that we still have  real issues with inflation. first of all, i would point to  the fact that paul volcker cut  rates in an election year, in  1979. and -- under the idea that  inflation rates were falling. that didn't work out so well. because runway inflation  reaccelerated really quickly  into reagan's first two years in office. in this case, we've got rising  energy prices again. we have a particularly  longshoreman strike up there in  the pacific northwest. the wars around the world don't  really seem to be getting any  better right now. so i don't think that you can  spike the football here, if  you're the fed. i don't think you can say that  we've beaten inflation. and their favorite measure, the  super core inflation, is still  up around 2.9%, year over year. so this may be a bigger battle  than we think it is. z >> so what are you telling your  clients on that? tell them to keep some inflation protection or not get too  excited about that? what's the upshot of that. >> i think inflation protection  is very, very important here. we have a weaker dollar. part of that is because, of  course, interest rate cuts. and we have rates coming down. that's historically a good  backdrop for commodity-related  areas and natural resources. and these things are trading at  the cheapest levels we've seen  since the 1930s, relative to the dow jones industrial average. and a lot of it is based on  resources. look at where ukraine and russia are fighting. the areas they're fighting over, they're very, very heavy for  resources. i like the national resources  and fossil fuels here. >> jim, i completely agree with  you on the inflation side of the story. i think vsarah and i agree on  this, this 50 basis point half  percent cut caught me by  surprise. you're saying, maybe we'll see  this reignition of inflation. this longshoreman thing is a big deal and it's not getting enough attention. was it wrong for the federal  reserve to cut by half a  percent? >> it's a great question,  because when you look at the  history of federal reserve  interest rate cuts, the markets  have done better when they  sta started off with a quarter. usually when the markets see  that we're starting off with  half a point cut, it reeks of  maybe a little bit, maybe i'm  late to the game, it reeks of a  little bit of a desperation  there. and i don't really know that  they have slayed the dragon. the good news for the federal  reserve board is they have some  room to cut, but rates are  pretty restrictive when you  compare the fed funds rate to  the inflation rate. i get what they're doing, but  they have to be very careful  about messaging here. getting back to the market, i  think the market looks okay,  there's rotation as you just  mentioned. but let's also remember that  we're entering into election  season, the last week of  september, early october is  usually very rocky in the  markets, and we have one  candidate that wants to raise  capital gains rates. think about that. anybody and their mother owns  nvidia and in any event 7, and  they're way up in it. if you have an election where  you have the winner th","Category: Macro

"Take auto loan defaults with a 'grain of salt' in read on overall consumer health, says UBS' Mish",2024-09-25 15:36:02+00:00,4,ys4PaYtGsdA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys4PaYtGsdA,"in terms of quality.  >>>'s  >>>.  >> it's interesting it changes  the whole view. >>> autoloan defaults surging to 15 year highs. some are calling it a canary in  the coal mine when it comes to  the consumer. our next guest said take it with a grain of salt. matt misch joins us now. how severe are the delinquenc
s delinquencies? >> i think certainly you've seen two things that are notable. one we're not talking about sub  prime abs delinquencies anymore. we're talking about prime. and about 80 to 85% of all auto  loans or financing for an auto  purchase essentially are prime. the second thing i would say is  again the levels have been  certainly elevated relative to  the last call it three to five  years. but what we've really seen is an uptick. approaching 2009 levels. having said that we think  investors should take this with  a grain of salt, particularly in terms of the read for the  overall consumer health. there's a few reasons for that. one is net losses are not  keeping up at the same rate as  the delinquency surge you're  seeing. a lot of this we believe is due  to something called churning. when consumers miss a payment or two on an auto loan and then  start to repay. so there's underlying fragility  but ultimately consumers want to keep the car and are basically  making payments after missing a  few. the second i would say is  nonrevolving credit growth  remains strong through july. it ticked up a couple of  percentage points to about 5%  year on year. and resolving credit growth as  well is also fairly stable. and the last point really is  that overall, we believe that  auto loans account for about 9%  of household debt, 4% of bank  loans in the u.s. so this is an area where,  obviously, you know, crises you  crises don't strike twice, so to speak. housing is not going to be the  problem. the areas that are of concern  are really consumer loans within household credit. and autos is certainly, as well  as credit cards, you know, in  focus right now. >> and those aren't as bad. is that what you're saying, in  terms of ddelinquencies,  defaults? >> those are not. mortgage delinquencies are  increasing, but still a standard deviation mobelow average. and keep in mind mortgage credit is about 70% of total household  debt. from our side, what we did was  downgrade our view for  high-grade and high-yield auto  credit to underweight. but we didn't necessarily change the overall softish landing that we have on the consumer, because i think it's too early. there's enough data points that  suggest that this is not  necessarily, as you say, a  canary in the coal mine, that  investors should seize upon. >> still, it's a risk. and i wonder, matt, if you see  it priced into the financials at this point, i remember that ally warning a few weeks ago at the  barclays conference of credit  challenges, especially tied to  autos is in the banks. >> yes, i think from our  standpoint, we downgraded the  high-yield financial sector to  neutral. i think you have to separate  banks from the rest of the  financial sector, but i do think that there'll some challenges  going into third quarter  earnings. you know, we've seen that with  some other cyclical names like  kb home overnight. and so, you know, i do think  that if this is a credit cycle,  as it normally plays out, where  those areas that are more  vulnerable start to deteriorate  and deteriorate first, certainly higher beta or lower quality  credit or names in the stock  market. and those areas that people are  looking for more pressure,  again, within household debt, we would say, it's not going to be  mortgage c","Category: Macro

Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman on his favorite holdings,2024-09-25 13:49:29+00:00,9,WZ8hcS6jltg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ8hcS6jltg,">> doing good. it's 8:15. made it through most of the  morning so far. lee, let me ask you. you have been concerned about  the market and the heights of  the market for some time.  you've been warning that things  could take a turn down and that  you are less optimistic than  others. we keep hitting new highs, and i wonder, when do you think things would potentially be offset? i know you're still not  convinced that good times are  here to stay? >> yeah. very concerned about two things. one is the debt buildup. we have two candidates running  for office. neither one talks about the  deficit or the build up of debt. in 2017 i think our national  debt was $20 trillion. seven years later it's $34  trillion.  that's a growth rate far an  excess of the growth rate of the economy, and it's gogsz ing to   problem one day. we don't know the problem but  probably when we least expect  it. secondly i would say what's kept me involved in the market is the ten-year bond belonged to 3.6  rate currently little in the  markets overvalued. 3.76 reflective of a coming  recession.  if it's 3.76, recession, very  little overvalued. now, i go back to 1972, 50-50,  when the market selling, a much  bigger multiple than selling at  now and 6.5%. 2000, then present day nvidia,  380 times earnings. and in 2000, what is -- also 6%. so 3.76, nothing overvalued. very little overvalued.  >> so has the fed cutting rates  pushed you into a position where you're going to be putting a lot more into stocks? >> no. i'm fully invested, but invested in merchandise. 20% position in bond. i think the government's behave  sir disgraceful. discussed about it before. complicated. about 15% energy. what's going on in the middle  east, i think energy would be a  place to have some money. and then a lot of special  situations. so i'm not saying a lot of cash. fed cutting rates, cutting rates on the short endand i think the long rate will go up. ten-year rates will go up as the fed reduces short rates. back to this. >> does that make sense to you? the fed cut rates, looking where you see the economy? >> yeah. i would say that short rates are too high.  relative. you know, historically, the  ten-year government bond is  non-yield gdp. real growth about 2.5% inflation 2.5, 5% gdp. d ten year not overvalued at 5%  yield. it would be undervalued. i think rates would go higher. short end, you know, maybe you  get 125 basis points of  inflation. so rate doesn't belong at the  current 5%.  so i think the fed will cut  short rates. not making much difference. only use short rate to discount  a long duration asset.  >> so your concerns about when  we will have a problem on our  hands in terms when people won't buy the government debt, as you  said, probably coming at the  time we least expect it? how do you prepare yourself for  that? >> well, i think -- look, i may  be too old. take me out behind the barn and  shoot me. i'm 81 years old. been flthrough a couple bubbles. 2000 bubble and in 1972 bubble. and the bear market loses,  loses, wins. i would think that, preparing, i think stocks are the best place  to be. avoid bonds.  and just don't know the timing. just don't know the timing.  in 1972, two very similar --  peter peterson and henry fowlie  used to run fudge-page ads in  the journals and times warning  about deficit. here we are, what? 50 years later. only significant has been lowest interests rates in our lifetime. i don't any it's sustainable. in the '70s, assisting in  fighting two wars.  no one's focused on reducing the deficit, and we're going to hope we have crowding out. that's my view. very concerned. concerned about the election  outcome. two people running for election  out here, neither one talking  about fiscal issues. we got to finance these wars. not thinking about -- whether  the market forces one day -- who the hell knows. i think it when. that leads to my conservatism. and very conservative. i think the market at 2121, 22  times earnings, my view, doesn't exist. finding plenty of things to do  in the market. to be hoecnest with you. you have to look at, leads me to be cautious. everybody talks about stock  repurchase. i just observe the wise man does what the fool does in the end. how many billions of stock,  backed? intel now on government  assistance, and, you know, bed  bath & beyond, a great retailer, in bankruptcy.  so there's no magic. only makes sense to buy back  stock if its cheap. and so far into a bull market  make stock isn't cheap, make  you're making a mistake.  >> talk about the things you  finding to do. 15% in energy. because you worry what's  happening in the middle east and think that will potentially  drive energy prices higher,  where are you looking? where have you invested most? >> i have two large positions in two canadian oil and gas  companies. paramount resources for a while  and 7% stock yield. they have virtually no debt. producing $31 oil a barrel. increasing production. go from 100, 1,000 days  production to probably 150,000  over the next few years. debt-free company. current dividend yields about  7%. financed better than cash. another company run by a very  smart guy. michael rose of -- of -- one of  the largest oil and gas  producers in canada. stock yield of 5%. run by a very smart guy. and i would think that given  what's going on in the middle  east there's a risk that oil  prices move higher than we  think.  one that i have a very big  position in, but it's  complicated. a company called laga doesodoes  lagado. krae","Category: Macro

"Yale's Natasha Sarin on Trump vs. Harris' tax policies: One is fiscally responsible, the other isn't",2024-09-25 12:58:00+00:00,7,Tvc7xDwgZ3A,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvc7xDwgZ3A,"kamala harris and donald trump  are sharing more details of  their economic proposals as the  election draws closer. joining us to discuss what we  know so far, pwc's rohit kumar  and professor at yale law school and yale school of management  natesha sarin. let's start with you, rohit,  you're here on set. i would normally say which group of proposals is bet ter. in this case, i'm sorry, i'm  going to, you know, out myself,  i think we have to ask which  case is actually worse. i don't -- i'm not going to ask  which is better. which is less bad in your view? >> they both have pros and cons. both have -- both candidates  that have policies that raise a  lot of money and both sets of  policies that money would, even  though the check is being  written by the importer on the  case of the tariff or company in the case of a corporate rate who actually bears the burden of the tax is actually like regular  workers, right, customers of  companies, workers w work at a company, you invest in a  company, more than 61% of the  population owns shares in a  company, so there is, you know,  both sides are trying to make  the argument that mine comes  from the money tree at the end  of the double rainbow somewhere  over, wherever. that's not true. there is a disingenuity at some  level that my money is free  money, but your money is --  >> i didn't hear any pros there, rohit. do you have any pros? maybe you do. let me ask it this way. let's say -- since we're all  saying, hey, it is going to be  divided government, not to  worry, neither one of these  candidates is going to get what  they're saying done. but what if it did happen? what if everything each  candidate has proposed actually  happened? which is worse? >> i guess i kind of disagree  with rohit in that i think there is a pretty big substantive  difference between these two  candidates. in donald trump, you have  basically like a no taxes on  everything approach. it is no taxes on tips, no taxes on social security, no taxes  on -- no taxes to the tune of  $10 trillion of unfinanced  deficit increases. and in kamala harris, you have  just a much more fiscally  responsible approach. you have her saying she wants to invest in growing the american  families, in expanded child tax  credit, you have her saying she  wants to invest in small  businesses, the engines of  growth in the american economy. and she is going to pay for  that. and so it is just a  fundamentally fiscally different approach, one is fiscally  responsible and the other isn't, and that's why i think you have  88 business leaders, you have 68 nobel laureates in economics,  you have tax experts on both  sides saying in this election,  it is not a close call, there is one candidate you should trust  with the economy, and fiscal  responsibility and that's kamala harris. >> whoa. wow. you got anything after that,  rohit? >> yeah, look, i mean, yes,  there are a whole bunch of tax  increases and vice president  harris' campaign proposal, but  those taxes would largely were  born by the middle class. this is not an argument about,  you know, and moreover, many of  the proposals that former  president trump has indicated  like no taxes on tips, vice  president harris has adopted  that as well because we are in a campaign, and politicians will  say things in campaigns, but  when we get to the end of next  year, we have $4.5 trillion of  tax relief that is expiring. that's the issue on the table. and the question is, are we  going to pay for it, deficit  finance it, some of that stuff  not going to get extended, my  guess it is going to be some  combination of those three  levers. those are the levers on the  table and that's the serious  conversation.  >> we could be totally fiscally  responsible and raise the  marginal rate to 90% on rich  people, we could go -- take  corporate taxes back to 40%. do you ever ask the other side  to -- are there any consequences to taking the money out of the  private sector, innovation and  entrepreneurs and business  formation? >> you can take all the money  from all the people and no one  would engage in economic  activity.  >> that would be fiscally  prudent.  >> you would run the economy  into the ground.  >> there must be some middle  ground. natasha, you see what i'm  saying? you want to raise --  >> yeah, no. >> you don't think any of the  trump tax cuts are responsible  for the strong economy we have  right now? the corporate tax cut, no  benefits from what we saw in  2017? none? >> so, i don't think you have to just trust me, i think you can  kind of trust the empirical  evidence here, which is the best work that i've seen on this has  come out of economists princeton and chicago, eric swick and they say the trump tax cutswere  mechanical decrease of 40% in  corporate tax revenue, and to be fair, you did see some growth  increase and what you saw is  that growth increase offset  maybe 2 percentage points of  that 40% decline. and so i think there is just  frankly space with respect to  raising corporate tax rates,  part of the reason why i think  there is some space here is the  corporate tax rate today is 21%. business round table when tcj  was being legislated, they were  going for a 25% rate. the u.s. raises something like  6% of its taxes from corporate  taxes, the average is like 12%. so there is just space here and  revenue here to be had in a pro  growth way, which is --  >> how much more -- there is a  significant -- there has been a  significant increase in  corporate taxes between 2017  and --  >> breaking records.  >> breaking records. >> breaking records. let me fill in, we have nice  economic research, i've got  economic research that would --  >> that reminded me of climate  models. >> let's look at real data. real data. post tcga, real wages increased  by $6,000. faster than the last 10 years,  prior ten years combined. unemployment record like lowest  since we started measuring --  >> lower than it is now. >> there is some -- there is  some models, you get multiple  economists, multiple answers,  the real data would tell you  this had a real growth effect on the economy and it par","Category: Politics

The key source of Middle East disorder is that Iran doesn't feel deterred: Palantir's Mike Gallagher,2024-09-25 12:39:53+00:00,7,Mhwwces2hAk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mhwwces2hAk,"security for israel and gaza  free of hamas' grip, ease the  suffering in gaza and end this  war. >> joining us now is mike  gallagher, head of defense at  palantir, former republican  congressman representing  wisconsin. do you see any path to ending  this war? >> well, i think these knee jerk calls for a cease-fire, which  the biden administration has  been pushing since october 8th,  actually bring us further away  from an end to a war. i would like to propose a new  theory of international  relations called winning. you have to win the war in order to impose the terms of the  peace. as for any action or resolution, the u.n. can take and biden's  calls for such a resolution  pertaining to a cease-fire, we  have something called u.n.  security council resolution 1701 which calls for complete  disarmament of southern lebanon  and lebanon and hezbollah has  not disarmed. and israel with remarkable  audacity has actually reduced  50% of hezbollah's long range  precision fires and we should  support them in that effort and  in the efforts to destroy hamas  in the south. >> and what you're saying, what  iran does in retaliation? >> i think the key source of  disorder in the region is the  fact that iran does not feel  deterred. and the key problem that the  next president, whether it is  donald trump or kamala harris  will have to solve is how do we  restore a semblance of  deterrence? degrading and deterring  hezbollah and what the united  states can do is destroying  another terrorist iranian proxy, the houthi rebels, which, have  completely shut down commerce in and around the red sea and we  are now on the wrong side. our enemies are counting down  the bullets in our chamber. all of this depends on our  ability to rebuild our entire  defense industrial base, which  this conflict and the conflict  in eastern europe has revealed  as broken. >> mike, is it purely partisan,  political talk to try to assign  some blame to the biden  administration? because they took off the  sanctions in february of 2021,  the u.n. sanction, hasn't  enforced the -- they're rolling  in money in iran right now to be able to fund all these proxies. why is that a stretch to say  that this was on the biden  administration? >> i don't think it is a  partisan hack attack. it is simple, cause and effect  we delist the houthis, we  prevent the government from  selling offensive weapons to the saudis to go after the houthis  and they re-emerge as a -- just  like a two-bit terrorist  organization, one capable of  attack the united states navy. that's a fair attack. but i do think biden's speech is an opportunity for us to take a  step back and assess this  administration's overall foreign policy record.  >> but the rational was that the 2015 pact that trump exited that this would make it easier to get back. so there was like a method to  the appeasement, wasn't there? but it didn't work, you would  say? >> i think iran is closer to the turnkey away from having a  nuclear weapon than it was at  the start of this  administration. the trump administration i think would argue that a policy of  maximum economic pressure was  bearing fruit, iran's economy is very weak. if you don't pair that policy  with a robust deterrent in the  region, it is not going to have  an effect. that's the challenge going  forward.  >> would you ascribe anything  with putin and ukraine to saying that we would be okay with them  taking a little bit of --  remember he said that, and a  week later --  >> i think all these things are  connected.  >> you do? >> draw a direct line from the  biden administration's decision  to withdraw from afghanistan for purely political reasons, and  that was the president  overruling his political -- his  military advisers, i think that  had an impact on putin's  calculus in eastern europe, and  on general global disorder and  on the deteriorating balance of  power in the most important  region, the indo-pacific.  >> back to the middle east, with where we are right now, and with israel making these incursions  into lebanon to try and push  hezbollah back with the missile  that they launched that  hezbollah launched into tel aviv essentially last night, one  missile, the expectation is they have a lot more. what happens now? because netanyahu's decision to  push forcefully, where does that get us? and obviously they were dealing  with attacks from october 8th  coming from hezbollah. but what about now? >> i think the overriding  political objective in israel is to return israelis to the north  of the country. that -- until you actually force a disarmament in key parts of  southern lebanon, it doesn't  have to completely comply with  1701 that i mentioned before,  that's going to be very  difficult. you don't want israelis being -- >> is this different than  before? are we closer to an all-out war  breaking out --  >> in the middle east, for the  last two decades, we're always  on the knife's edge of an  all-out war. the path to peace in my opinion  eventually runs through tehran. you have to deter the primary  adversary in the region and the  thing that unites the israelis  and the reason we're seeing a  historic level of reproachment  and cooperation between israelis and suni or arab gulf states is  because of the shared path from  iran. you have to build a regional  strategy around deterring iran,  otherwise nothing else --  >> if iran had the bomb right  now, would it be a different  situation with israel right now? they seem to be -- they don't  really want to engage to the  full extent that they could. they actually have shown  restraint, which doesn't seem to go at all with what you think of when you say iran, but they had  the --  >> they could be hoping that the next administration has a more  friendly policy with respect to  iran or continues to hope that  by just merely reviving ","Category: Other

"The Israel-Hezbollah conflict could turn into a ground war, says CFR's Michael Froman",2024-09-25 12:31:10+00:00,7,DzqkngjkRqM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzqkngjkRqM,"box."" president biden calling for a  cease-fire in a push to contain  a broader regional conflict in  the middle east. joining us now is council  foreign relations president  michael froman. it's great to have you at the  table. help us understand. we heard what biden said. the question is we're going to  hear from bibi netanyahu and  whether he's going to actually  will i follow through on any of  this any time soon.  >> it doesn't look like there's  been much progress on the  cease-fire talks. in the meantime, the conflict  with lebanon --  >> it's only escalating.  >> it's only escalating. it's entering a new phase. you see that israel has managed  to kill 11 of the 12 top  hezbollah leaders. there's now an effort to push  back the hezbollah borders. of course, there's the missile  issue, which is that hezbollah  has about 150,000 missiles, one  came quite close to tel aviv,  intercepted by the israelis.  >> how come it was only one  missile fired into tel aviv? was it a warning to get them to  back off? >> it's unclear. it's pretty deep. we know they have the capability of hitting most of israel with  the wide range of missiles that  they have. there are reports that israel,  the air strikes have taken out a lot of their missile capability, but there's still a lot left.  >> that's the question. do you think it's working? >> the danger is when war  escalates, you can't predict how it's going to work out. certainly israel has managed to  have some pretty serious attacks on hezbollah, on the leadership, on the missiles. now the question is where do  they go from there. if it becomes a ground war, go  back in history to 2006 or  otherwise, it can get very, very difficult in lebanon, and i  think the rest of the region  would be quite concerned.  >> do you think it becomes a  groun ground war? >> i think it could. i think it could.  >> if israel sends troops in,  where does iran stand on this? >> big question. it's their second strike  capability. they use hezbollah as a  deterrent against israel. so far iran has been quite  restrained in terms of  encouraging hezbollah actions. however, with the lack of  cease-fire progress in gaza, if  there's really a ground effort  in lebanon, iran could retaliate as well, whether it's more  missiles coming from iran toward israel or other targets on  targets or relative targets. >> if you were to play this out  -- and this is not a game -- but if you were to play the war  game, what does this look like? best case/worst case? >> best case is israel manages  to reduce the threat hezbollah  faces from the missiles and  being proximate to the border.  >> how far away do you think  they are from that right now? >> i think early innings. they've just begun attacking the missiles. they still have all the people  near the border that need to be  pushed back, and they've got a  lot more --  >> who are they negotiating with if 11 of the top 12 leaders have been attacked? >> it's quite different than  hamas. there's been negotiations  between the biden  administration. they've been tryinging to get a  cease-fire or de-escalation  between hezbollah, and israel  has not succeeded as of yet. but there are political leaders. >> do you know this guy? the cfo? >> yes, indeed.  >> you do know him. i know you're a democrat, but  any truth to it this? >> what does it say? >> it says iran is waiting for  president harris.  >> there's a strong bipartisan  challenge. i don't see a significance  between one party or the other.  >> you don't think the way we've been approaching iran? >> i think biden has been firm.  >> all of this is happening  because he's been firm? >> when you say all of this has  happened? >> i showed you this when you  came in. all this.  >> i think iran --  >> all this has happened.  >> iran has been deterred from  leveling a major attack on  israel. there's been incredible  collaboration between the u.s.  and regional powers including  saudi arabia and uae to defeat  the missile, unprecedented  cooperation, and there continues to be progress with saudi arabia --  >> that's an interesting broader kind of question, which is if  you look at this administration  and you look at all the things  that are happening around the  world, do you place blame on  this administration for these  things happening? obviously you hear president  trump say if i was in this role, this would never happen. you as an expert in this field  --  >> an expert democrat.  >> -- would you say this is  inev inevitable? >> i think the issues in the  middle east predate this  administration. they go back centuries.  >> the abraham accords were  pretty good.  >> they were pretty good. i think the biden administration has tried to continue the good  work of normalizing relations as well. the tensions between iran and  them has been there for a while. >> sure.  >> if you remember, trump pulled out from --  >> let me ask you a different  way. do you believe that certain  leaders are able to deter  certain things from happening  just by their sheer force of --  >> -- their craziness.  >> that case or personality,  what have you. if you look at history, do you  say there are certain people who for whatever reason have had a  deterrent effect on certain 
e types of behavior? >> i think there is certainty  that a leader brings to the  table. ultimately it comes from the  forces we have there. we have central command, air  carrier strike groups in the  region, a lot of men and women  and aircraft and ships there. i think that's ultimately the  deterrent. and the progress that's been  made in terms of working not  just wit","Category: Macro

Advisors Capital’s JoAnne Feeney on her top stock picks,2024-09-25 11:55:12+00:00,7,mhuNVAaxF-U,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhuNVAaxF-U,"the market. joining us now for possible  pick, joann feeney, adviser and  managing partner and portfolio  manager. in a nutshell, we need to know  whether all the gains we've  seen, i think 20% in the s&p, in anticipation of the rate cut  cycle, does it continue, or is  it one of those situations  where, okay, we've had a lot of  anticipation of what was going  to happen, and most of the gains have already been made for the  year? >> yeah, good morning, joe. clearly there's a lot of  anticipation for the rate cuts,  but the rate cut cycle is just  beginning. as you know, we don't invest in  the market as a whole, so what  we look at is the individual  stocks, some of which you will  get a lift because of lower  interest rates. but more importantly, stay  focused on the earnings  potential. whether it's your money in ai or continuous builds of new houses  or struggles consumers face and  where they shop, a all of those  things create opportunities for  investors as opposed to just  looking at the big macropicture, wh which is the long interest rate  cuts.  >> what does that tell you, and  does everything -- the benefits  of lower interest rates, is it  still going to filter through,  through the housing sector and  other areas? rates initially went up. >> look at where it's come from  so far. it's come down from the highs  because the fed was convincing  in the fight against inflation,  so the long-term view came down  toward the 2%. that allowed the 10-year rate to come in. the reason why is the more  positive view on the health of  the economy, the longer term  growth rate. it looks like it's a little bit  better. as you know, the long-term  growth feeds into the 10-year  rate. does that help the housing  market? the housing market is helped by  the fact that it already has  come down a fair bit, and we see that in mortgage rates, and the  more important thing for housing is the fact we still have this  massive shortage after ten years of under build, and that's why  we look at the houses for  first-time home buyers and one  step up, which could see some  help from the federal  government, depending on which  candidate wins this race.  >> okay. so what do we buy? what are you recommending? would you do it today? >> yeah. we lit. we think it has more room to  run. it's suffered recently. it's had to give breaks on  buying houses because of the  affordability on the borrowing  side. so those kinds of breaks are  likely to get smaller. the discounts are likely to get  smaller as rates have gotten  lower over the past six, 12  months. and they're spinning off the  landslide of the business, so  these likely to help their  margins. we like lennar, and we think  it's got a long ways to go.  >> what else? >> we look at ai. capital is broadcom. the reason we like it is for  several. it's involved in the ai play in  two different ways that are  compelling. one, it co-develops with  specialized chips to run with  the ai models and the  specialized chips are  high-margin business for  broadcom. but in addition they do the  connectivity chips. in fact, they announced a new  generation of optical  connectivity, which speeds up  the flow. speed is everything. bandwidth is everything. they've always been a leader  here. as you know, they've done a  terrific job of buying up  companies that continue to bring in new product lines that are  leaders in their industries,  that have himars gins. they may not be the fastest  growing areas of the tech world  but they have a consistently  himars gin with deep modes and  they've done a great job with  generating smasive amounts of  free cash flow. we expect it to continue to do  well in the organic growth area  but also in m & a.  >> all right. i've still got some money. do you have another one? >> sure. let's go back to consumer. there's been a lot of talk about the consumers struggling. you hear concerns about the  economy, high prices, high cost  of buying a house. there are elements of the  consumer at the high end that  are just fine. they're not worried about going  up to 7.99 a point. but there are plenty who are  struggling. it's the midrange we're focusing on here. what they're doing, that kind of household, is finding ways to  trim their budgets, and they're  shopping at places like a t.j.  maxx, marshall's, or target. these areas offer quality, but  also value. folks really like the  treasure-hunting of t.j. maxx. another long-term holding. you have benefits on both sides. demand more traffic in the  stores, but also where they  source goods is becoming more a  attractive. they get products from other  stores like department stores  that are having trouble selling  stuff. we see that softening in some ","Category: Macro, Technology

Crowdell: We weren't talking about carbon emissions ten years ago,2024-09-25 11:52:16+00:00,4,rsnGWtqr-ow,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsnGWtqr-ow,"stocks and the new potential for ai and the power play. anthony is with the electric utilities and mizzou securities. i'll ask you what your take is on the nimby concept, not in my  backyard.  >> thank you so much there's still this nimby there's still this support for the industry now we weren't talking about carbon  emissions ten years ago. we are now i don't know whether nimby exists, but we could see some  key spots where we could build a nuclear reactor. the biggest driver -- pippa said it best -- there's no commercial plan in construction the cost, i don't think we're  going to see the buildup that  everyone is hoping for.  >> if that's the case, has the market gotten ahead of itself? we've talked about vistra, constellation energy what needs to happen for some of the valuations and price expectations to actually fill in with the actual implications of  the power plans and providers? >> it's a little more than the cost of firing up a power plant. i think those implications probably sparse. i think there's a couple, maybe  two or three we may see some up rates, but if tech is willing to sign the ppa, i think the stocks will continue to run, but as you say, dom, they're going to need to sign  these numbers for this run to  keep working.  >> and, by the way, there's a  decade maybe plus lead time for  some of these things to be approved, permitted, and built so this is maybe even more onerous than an oil rig out  there. i guess my final question, anthony, if it's not some of these stocks, which stocks do  you cover that you think are under appreciated with how people can capitalize on this  nuclear trade so to speak? >> it gives you a downside projection it's p.e. g. what i like about it, there may  be trade going on right now, but p.e. g. operating it in new  jersey that's going to provide ni","Category: Macro

CFTC Chair Russ Behnam on U.S. election betting: We don't want to commoditize elections,2024-09-25 11:51:31+00:00,7,tbCqQouiWhk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbCqQouiWhk,"trading commission announced  this summer they're monitoring a poly market, another offshore  crypto betting platform. markets are becoming heavily  scrutinized with people betting  on the upcoming presidential  election and joining us right  now to talk about it is the cftc chairman ros behnam. thank you for coming in today. >> thanks, becky.  >> these are markets we  definitely keep an eye on and  these predicted type markets  have been around for a long  time. you can bet on just about  everything. but obviously with the election  coming up, people look at these  things very closely. the assumption has been is that  because there is real money on  the line, maybe it is better  than the polling you see in some places. what is wrong with what these  platforms are doing pootentiall? >> first of all, good to be  here. i don't think there is  necessarily a question that  there is merit to the price  discovery function of these  markets. but really what the commission  has been saying for over a  decade now is that these markets are illegal under current law. and we have essentially pushed  that towards what we're dealing  with right now with the two  markets. but i would say what i've said  multiple times is this pulls the cftc into the role of being an  election cop. because if there is manipulation of the markets, if someone does  take the position long or short, which would be on a candidate,  and then potentially puts out  news that is not necessarily  true, this could spiral into a  situation where you have  manipulation of elections. and i think if --  >> convincing people --  >> moving markets. in the statute there are certain things that are illegal. war, assassination, terrorism,  gaming, anything that is  illegal, and congress did give  the cftc authority to make  decisions about public interest. i think we have to have a line  where we draw certain financial  contracts. we don't want to commoditize  elections and the integrity of  democracy.  >> front running. in fact, it would be like what  happens in the stock market. >> it is precisely the same type of manipulation we see in the  stock market or the derivatives  market. and we don't want to lay it over on elections. no. these are all illegal, not all  states, but this is illegal  under most states in the country and that really is at least a  part of our legal argument we  made before the court. and i've said this, you know,  people say this is illegal  overseas and some jurisdictions, but it is legal and it is  sanctioned under gambling laws. so i think if there is really a  strong demand for this, folks  need to think about where  they're going to go and where we sort of house this. and i think it is probably best  suited in a sort of gambling  structure as opposed to a  financial market regulatory  change.  >> this is not so much about  protecting the people who happen to be using the offshore betting houses. normally when the regulators  come up with these things, it  is, like, we don't want people  to be defrauded. this is more the situation we  don't want the election to be  stolen or manipulated.  >> i would never say our number  one priority is making sure  customer protections are in  place, but in this particular  situation when you're dealing  with democracy, and elections, i think we all collectively have  to think about where is that  line that we don't want to cross when it comes to financial  markets and the utility of  financial markets. and in this particular case,  both pulling the cftc into this  sort of space of being an  election cop and then as joe  mentioned the risk of people  front running or manipulating  markets by taking a position,  and given how news travels,  given what we have dealt with in 2020 and 2016, i often mention  the issues with dominion voting  systems, right, or the -- any  news about a candidate, local,  state, federal, having health  issues, not running, changing -- any decision that could impact  the price, the contract could  benefit a position.  >> it changes this pretty  drastically too.  >> a.i. is going to change all  our markets and the way we  intersect with fraud and  manipulation. when we talk about public  elections, and we talk about  democracy, the integrity of  democracy quite frankly and the  health of our country, i don't  think we want to --  >> now i wish you could look at  polls. there is pollsters that go from  a plus to f minus i think. and even the a plus i think had  17-point difference in  wisconsin. it was one point. i was -- one reason i liked the  betting sites, i don't believe a lot of the polls. now i can't believe either. there is no way -- the  deviation -- the standard  deviation is so big on either  that they're useless. everything is useless.  >> i would say -- joe, i  wouldn't say totally useless,  but this might go back to my  point about if there is a real  strong demand and desire to do  this, then we should think about it at the state level. elections are largely handled at the state level, and like i  said, you know, in the uk this  is sanctioned under gambling, we should do the same if this is  really what people want.  >> what about folks who step  in -- ireland has a big  operation, all the stuff is  offshore.  >> yeah. it is sanctioned under gambling  laws.  >> i understand that. but the question is, do you want americans participating in that  through all sorts of mechanisms  which are happening anyway? >> so, becky to your point about a statement i made a few months  ago or a few weeks ago, we have  offshore betting sites that  essentially offer services to  u.s. customers. and if the services end up being derivatives contracts and you're not registered with us, then we  have, you know, a right to bring enforcement action and we have  done that in the past and we're  constantly monitoring that.  >> 40 days from an election what is going to happen, how are you  going to do anything this time  before the election? we're looking at the sites  already on a regular basis.  >> this is the enforcement  mechanism of our agency. we have to build a case, get the facts, we have to go to a court. so we do things in order, we do  things with a very sort of  particular process. and we don't hesitate. so if there are u.s. investors,  u.s. customers being offered  derivatives, without the entity  being registered with us or  letting us know, then we're  going to bring an enforcement  case.  >> what could you do? could you shut them down? >> on one hand it is certainly  fines on the civil side. there could be a criminal  element to it, but that is  outside of our jurisdiction. and then there is the deterrent  factor. if we can levy enough fines  depending on the scope of the  allegation and the charges, that perhaps is going to put a --  >> let me ask you this, the  announcement and the  investigation itself, has that  acted as a deterrent, have you  seen any change in behavior? >> i think with the -- this has  been going on within the cftc  for over ten years. i think with the court  challenge, there was a court  decision by district court a few weeks ago, we appealed and the  court of appeals in the district court in d.c., and i think  people are understanding that,  you know, this is the position  of the commission, we're not  going to back off of it, we will respect ","Category: Crypto
