Stocks mentioned: Meta

Key takeaways:
* The S&P 500 is nearing the end of a bull market cycle, with discussions on market strategy targets, including a target of 5600 and an optimistic upside target of 6100.
* Big tech companies are anchoring the market, despite the perception of broadening, with companies like Meta reaching near all-time highs.
* The market has shifted somewhat, with 40% of companies driving the S&P 500 up from the previous 25%, though the broadening of earnings is incremental.
* Inflation is reportedly coming down, giving flexibility in monetary policy, with expectations leaning towards a continuation of 25 basis point adjustments rather than 50.
* Bond yields might become a headwind if they approach 5%, but the current economic conditions show strong job growth, a decent inflation rate, and a robust services sector.
* Manufacturing remains weak globally, causing mixed economic signals and concerns about the strength of the U.S. and global consumer markets, particularly at lower income levels."
J_zcV14qCjw,Gaming sector is seeing record growth,2024-10-08 14:42:57+00:00,10,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_zcV14qCjw,the gambling industry in the united states has reached a period of transformation this week the tropicana is coming down out with the olds making way for the new sports has exploded in the world of gambling and commercial casinos are on fire with me now the ceo of the american gaming association bill miller to what do you attribute the continued growth in gambling well i think it's really been an exciting time if you think about co's not that long ago and there were so many people who said look the gameing industry is going to have this sugar high period and then it's going to dissipate and what we've seen though is 41 months in a row of continued growth and that is really something to celebrate secondly what the industry recognized was we have an opportunity to reset and that reset was demographically everybody had always said well you know the thing about the casino industry is it's a blue hair business and the older you get the the the more likely we're going to get casino pat what we've seen in the last few years is the demo for our industry has skewed down from 50 to 42 and the reason is because we were able in the early days postco to introduce an entirely new segment of the population a whole new demographic millennials gen zers to our industry the gaming floor and all of the other elements of the industry in order to create a new customer base these are also young people who are growing up on online gambling or gaming that then when they reach an age where it's legal or where where it's legal that it's not much of a leap to figure out how to play games that they know and love online for money yeah but but for this industry to keep growing do you have to have more states embracing eye gaming and expanding opportunities in sports betting um look i think the sports betting has shown to be an incredible success right we've literally gone from one state in america where you could legally bet on sports to 39 in the district of columbia all in six years and so that legalization created another whole cohor of customers that understand the gaming industry many of which understand the gaming industry through their phone because that's how they interact with in all consumer facets and so the gambling industry whether it's the casinos sports betting or eye gaming these are all elements that i think that you know our customers want us to interact with them in a way that they want to interact and so that's our job because of the explosion in the digital business it has also brought with it an unprecedented level of scrutiny about where there might be societal harm whether there's underage game gambling whether uh integrity in sports can be guaranteed now you have lawmakers coming forward and introducing legislation that they think will help protect consumers that also creates a headwind doesn't it for the industry how do you deal with that well that's a lot to impact so i'll start with the congressional threat you know if you will look i i think that there are always people who want to see the industry in the manner in which they view it right and so like 435 members of the house 100 members of congress right now the industry has never been seen more favorably by the general public as a mainstream entertainment outet and so are we going to go back to a a place of prohibition which some in congress want i don't think so the american public doesn't think so and the congress doesn't think so and so look well-intentioned fine but our industry has been built on responsibility and sustainability based around creating the right kind of relationships with our customers and so i feel really good about where we are as an industry and i look at that from the perspective of who care who really cares i mean in terms of policy makers a couple policy makers have said we need to re this in this is out of control when we say we needed to create more advertising in order to move people from the illegal market into the legal marketplace advertising helped us do that it helped us break down some of the illegal market and we're happy about that but we've also seen in the last two years via neelen that advertising spend for sports betting specifically which is what gains all of the attention has been down both years when you think about what's to come do you anticipate needing more fight on enforcement warding off the unregulated offshore casinos or sweep stakes which operators are really avidly defending their right to operate sweep stak style gaming um very challenging questions the one is pretty easy you know offshore online websites that prey upon customers in america they should be outlawed because they are against the law and our members and our companies go through a pretty rigorous regulatory scrutiny in order to get license and then be able to operate and so the offshore guys really that needs to be a priority for law enforcement now the sweep stakes is a little bit different because these are individuals who and this is an industry that is constantly reinventing itself and that these individuals that have created these businesses are operating under in their opinion a regulatory frame that works and some jurisdictions have accepted that we think that at the end of the day if you're going going to operate a real money sports betting business or a real money ey gaming business it has to be underneath the gambling umbrella in terms of regulation and so you know we're all working our way through this you know at the a we have tried to do everything that we can to make sure that regulators understand they are the ultimate arbiters of what regulatory frame these people operate under one more the court has now just cded again with cy when it comes to predictions markets and the election we have a big election coming up there are those who argue and and the commodities commission is one of them that it interferes with the integrity of elections and the same way people might argue about the integrity of sports where do you come down on the predictions markets and whether that's gambling and should be regulated like gambling well i think first of all gambling should be regulated at the state level i think that that has been the way in which this industry was created and that's the way it should stay the federal government has a role fon money laundering irs and treasury those are all really important uh people that we we pay very close attention to but as it relates to should there be gambling options in and around uh politics uh my view is that it's not the federal government's role to empower this and i although i don't necessarily believe the argument that people make that you know if you would bet on the futures of politics that then you can control the outcome i think that that's kind of a reach but you know i'm an old political guy and i don't think that it's very easy to actually control outcomes of elections and then by extension create integrity issues around the election now i will go back to the the integrity of sports because that is one of those things that we've ted talked about in the past and is always core that our our industry we work with our partners at the in all of the leagues with teams arenas broadcasters in order to make sure that the most important thing if we're going to create a legal robust sports betting market is that the integrity of the game is san recet the interesting thing when you think about this is when you bet on football if you have the overwhelming number of bets coming in on the patriots it doesn't necessarily mean that the patriots are more likely to win but a lot of times in the predictions market if you have an overwhelming number of markets coming in for a particular candidate the interpretation is that candidate is more likely to win yeah maybe i mean it's like polling though you know you think about polling and you kind of say well are is is polling accurate and now people are voting in the predictions market with their money rather than maybe misleading a pollster but there's still this this is a very inexact science and again better left of the states than the federal government and again this is bill miller personal view i don't think that america we should be in the in the political betting business phil on that note thank you thank you,"Category: Other

kujiL3UPdO8,What to expect from the market,2024-10-08 14:19:13+00:00,5,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kujiL3UPdO8,"already. >> but him selling the shares  itself will put pressure on it. >> time will tell. some interesting things. let's talk about it, in fact. there are some, i don't know --  i've been troubled for a while,  but we know that. both the dow and s&p 500 seeing  their worst day yesterday since  september 6th, as oil prices and treasuries rose. joining us now at the technicals levels he's watching, jason  hunter, head of technical  strategy at jpmorgan. 22 and change on the vix. there were some weird re-post  stuff going on, the ten-year has been headed higher. are there concerning  underpinnings or is it all  systems go? >> i think it's a little  confusing, given the leadership  changes we've seen since  mid-summer in the equity space,  where you've had defensives and  cyclicals rally at the same time and kind of take the baton from  tech, which doesn't entirely  make sense. it looks like the market is  trying to make both tail risk  bets at the same time going into the september fmoc. but regardless, that's got the  smp, having broken out after the fmoc, after an all-time high,  from a pure chart-based  perspective is a positive, it's  maintained that breakout, hasn't been able to build on it, but a  breakout's a breakout. >> that's the question, i guess. is it going to break out or is  it going to go down? and do you see any signs that we could be topping out? >> you know, so i would say,  when you take the big step back, and some of the commentary we've had over the last months, when  you look at how long the curve's been inverted and now you're  starting to get a bullish  steepening impulse, generally,  that tends to coincide more with bearish equity performance, at  least over a short-term. you know, as the fed's initially starting to ease. but we haven't had the data to  really suggest that, oh,  recession's -- the sum of the  labor data softened, but the  unemployment rates ticked back  down. the demand data has picked back  up. and you can see the equity  market is quite confused by  that. again, with the leadership shift that we've seen. you know, so, at the end of the  day, it's a lot of mixed  signals. the individual charts across  different asset classes, you get a lot of things that don't  necessarily fit together. so what i've done in the recent  months is i'll take each chart  at face value and leave the kind of the macro overlay aside. the pieces aren't necessarily  fitting together right now. and like i said, if we get a  breakout in the s&p, a breakout  in the russell 2000 like we had  after fmoc, that's a bullish  bias. i'll put my stock just  underneath the breakout levels  and act more like a trend  follower, than trying to get  ahead of the things. because that quite frankly has  not worked. >> do you try to handicap  geopolitical events? or you don't even try? >> no, so i think you recognize  what those risks are, and i  think it's more about risk  management around the views and  trades, where -- set a tighter  stop. or some of the things that tend  to go non-linear, if you think  about brenttraded back up into  the summer range, and you  realize, that may not just be a  move into the upper end of the  range, that could be a blowoff. and you realize the risks around the views and set your stops  accordingly. >> okay. so what about the breadth of the advance right now? finally, something that turned  into a positive or still  something that makes you  skeptical? >> yeah, so i think that's where you see the russell breaking  out, small cap having led large  cap through the latter part of  the summer. you're getting a broader breadth of things that's participating  in the s&p rally. that's generally a positive. that's an early cycle-type  story. let's call that a bet that the  manufacturing cycle globally is  going to start to repair itself. and you can see with dm central  banks easing, some policy news  out of china, that all makes  sense right now. but again, you also had  defensive leadership at the same time. so those two pieces don't  exactly square well together. >> people are just covering  their bases? >> i think that's right. and you treat, in that world,  you just treat each chart  separately and i'll put my  charts in stop after a breakout, i'll chase that, and act a bit  more reactive than trying to  predict where the next pivot's  going to be, and hopefully  things will start to clear up a  bit more and we'll get some  foresight. but right now, being reactive  and keeping tight risk  tolerances the right way --  >> what other markets around the world are important to us right  now? >> i think the rates market is a big one. in fact, when the two-year note  got to 350 recently, going into  and after the fmoc, both the  technicals, you know, just  looking at the chart pattern,  suggests the rally looked  exhausted. but when you look at how the  forward curve was priced, how  many easings they had priced  into the forwards, we actually  went short two-year note. that has backed up with the help of this friday's payroll report, to a level where i don't think  it goes much higher from here. we think 412 is a limit for 2s,  so whatever concerning, let's  say, input that would have into  equities, that, oh, the fed's  not goin","Category: Macro

Stocks mentioned: None specifically by name.

Key takeaways:
* The current market environment is experiencing mixed signals, with both the Dow and S&P 500 suffering their worst day since early September amid rising oil prices and treasury yields.
* Although there's uncertainty in market leadership with cyclicals and defensives rising simultaneously, technical analysis indicates that the S&P 500's current breakout is positive from a chart perspective.
* The equity market is wrestling with different macroeconomic signals, such as an inverted yield curve transitioning to a bullish steepening, which typically forecasts short-term bearish equity performance.
* Economic data doesn't clearly predict a recession, as labor markets and demand data remain ambiguous, adding to the market's confusion.
* Strategies suggest being reactive and placing tight stops at breakout levels, treating each chart separately rather than trying to predict outcomes.
* A notable technical breakout in the Russell 2000 indicates stronger small-cap performance compared to large caps, hinting at a potential global manufacturing recovery.
* Investors are diversifying their bets, given the mixed market signals, with defensives also maintaining leadership alongside small caps.
* The global rates market is crucial, as recent movements in the two-year note suggest a peak, potentially setting limits for further tightening impacts on equities."
bcLh8jyBNKQ,BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt on the relationship between sports and gaming,2024-10-08 14:14:36+00:00,9,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcLh8jyBNKQ,it's been an incredible year for sports betting and ey gaming so far this year the through the first seven months sports betting has grown 30% in terms of gross gaming revenue i gaming up about 27% with me now is the ceo of v mgm adam greenblat adam it's great to see you it's great to see you contesta the incredible growth that we're seeing in online play is it mostly coming from states that are ramping up that they're newly legalized or are you seeing incredible growth even in more mature states so it's actually both the the great news for both the uh the more mature states and the new states because it gives you a picture of what's ahead is um appetite and depth is is tremendous and more so than we anticipated at the outset of this of this journey we talked to you at super bowl and you were telling me about your high hopes for new technology at b mgm for regaining some market share that you've lost to competitors the tech is called angstrom how's it working out so we've been delighted with the performance of an you might remember that the first product that we brought to market was focused on mlb and uh what we we became bmgm became the home of the home run uh during the season and the number angstrom powered um uh home run bet increased your reno by 245 and this is all enabled by having different types of markets having more availability having better pricing and that's all powered by angstroms unique approach to pricing when i went to investor day for fanduel a couple weeks ago the company was very clearly happy having taken the number one ey gaming slot happy to have increased their moat around the number one position in sports betting can you catch up well i think in i gaming our strength is is demonstrable we've just won another reward for the third year in a row the i gaming operator of the year and um i think you'll see from some of the early trends that the work that we're doing in in uh product in jackpots in unique and special content only available at at bmgm is bearing fruit um bmgm gave away the largest jackpot ever uh in the history of i gaming uh in new jersey in august $65 million to one lucky player somebody who is playing online somebody who's playing online walked away $6.2 million richer on the day which is wonderful which is exciting but we've also been a pioneer in in our relationship between sports and gaming uh we have got um nba blitz uh we've got nhl gold blitz um these are sport properties and partnerships that that we've built games against and so this bridges our activity in sports with our activity in in i gaming and our sports players love it cross sell year on year is now increasing dramatically we're north of 50% cross sell on a week uh on a weekly basis so really pleased about the potential for both parts of the business i've heard a lot of chatter here at the global gaming expo about the competitive threat of unlicensed gaming whether it's sk bbased games or online sweep stakes models which the operators will say it's perfectly legal to offer these sweep stakes style games is that an existential threat to licensed eye gaming in the united states i don't think so look we as a as a legal operator will always operate within the bounds of of the rules and the law and so i think there there needs to be a a a process of definition scope definition i think um the opportunity for the sweeps uh operators i think the legality of of or the boundaries of of what they're uh uh engaged in still needs to be tested but we'll defend our turf naturally um but we don't we don't see it as existential in any manner at all uh i feel like i ask you this every time we sit together but usually there's a reason for me to ask it that mgm has just um partnered with groupo globo in brazil to launch bet mgm in brazil it will be a direct competitor to main and it doesn't have anything to do with the bet mgm that you're running here in the united states they've launched bet mgm on leo vegas in the uk again a direct competitor to one of your co-owners and tain is this sustainable is it putting you in a difficult position to dance between these two companies yes well just for clarity the uh the the joint venture of which i'm chief executive uh has exclusive rights to operate in the us so there's no there's no debate about who's doing what in in the united states and frankly we're operating harmoniously in north of the border in canada where both leo vegas and tin and the joint venture my b mgm are are all active in the market and you know it's it's not without a degree of of uh uh pleasure that we've come from nothing bm jim my joint venture has come from nothing to be the largest uh operator by market share um in in uh ontario so can we coexist yes are we coexisting yes relationship in the and uh board dynamic and conversation has never been better so i don't it doesn't put me in a difficult position at all what can you learn from ontario for the the rest of the united states south of the canadian border well what we see is uh a market where direct promotional activity is not allowed and that not withstanding a a business can flourish we're demonstrating that what i'm also excited about is the strength of the mgm brand north of the border and that's particularly relevant given that we have alberta coming which is going to be both a sports and i gaming state so it's the first i gaming state we've had in a couple of years and this is obviously b mgm's uh heartland it strength it's uh mgm resorts as a as a brand resonates particularly well uh with uh with gamers and so we're looking forward to capitalizing that uh on that when when alberta regulates how's football oh my goodness so the genesis to what to my excitement is the progress we've made in product and you you you did check angstrom but the whole product experience the bed mgm sports product experience is by some margin better than it's ever been our same game parlay experience our parlay experience our pre-build parlays our linear bet slip which allows us which allows players to see all their bet in a single pain uh a quick bet experience this is one titbit building a quick bet a little uh bar at the bottom of of the screen we've increased by the work we've done we've increased the number of legs on our quick bet by more than 100% and as we know more legs equals more margin and this is weeks in so really excited about the progress we're making our players are enjoying it our players are coming back from week to week in a way uh in a more engaged way than in prior periods and we've been helped by margin the first few weeks of the the season were really favorable to to to the industry and so september closed out what would be a record quarter for bam jy so really

* There are technical and regulatory challenges to be addressed, especially since Tesla uses only cameras while competitors use lidar and radar.

is that what you're seeing? >> i -- i would look at it more  as an indication of garbage  numbers. they're measuring really what's  8% of our room base in terms of  where rates were last year. it was well known that we held  rates very high coming into the  race and they dropped, as it  came. what we learned last year was  that we needed to fill sooner. so we're not holding rates as  high. if i look at, you know, f1 for  us, you know, it was a lift last year of almost $20 million --  >> wow. >> -- versus the weekend the  prior year. this year i would say, you know, flat to up or down a few million bucks versus last year, but up  the 20 versus two years ago. >> you mentioned the digital  business. you know, the powerhouse in this space is fanduel and draftkings  coming in a strong number two. and then there's this fight over the third and fourth positions. how important is it to you --  you just launched a new online  casino app, horseshoe,  yesterday. how much is this important to  the growth of caesars' business? and can you make an impact? can you grab market share away  from the two big players? >> yeah, contessa, i'm  old-fashioned, i like to make  money. i measure it based on how much  money we're making, not how much market share we have. so our promo spend is a third to a half of what draftkings and  fanduel have. so those subsidies don't run  through our ggr market share  numbers. but we've got a business that's  approaching, soon will exceed  20% ebitda margins, in a  business where most are still  losing money. >> before i let you go, you  know, we're keeping an eye on  florida and hurricane milton. i know you have -- your home is  in florida. i'm just -- how are things  looking for you? how is the situation for you,  being here and watching that  storm approaching? >> it's deja vu from two years  ago. i was in vegas watching ian hit  our home two years ago. this storm seems to be tracking  north of us. but we'll still have to deal  with surge and you should pray  for anybody that's in the middle of this. it's -- it's awful to go through these. and after the news cameras  leave, you know, a week or two  from now and go to where the  next storm is going to land, the people where it hits will have  to deal with this for the next  five or ten years. >> it is a monst","Category: Other

>> with $25,000, yeah. >> no, $25,000, going to build  more houses so there's a greater supply. she says she's going to give a  $50,000 credit to small  businesses, right? what else is on your list? >> i'm sorry, you can't run for  president -- you can't say, i'm  going to stop immigration, build a wall, make the economy  stronger. >> the idea that you're eye  sasa  i saying that nobody knows --  >> she's going to raise taxes on corporations. going to raise taxes on  individuals. she's going to do that to  maintain and increase programs  for what she says is the middle  class. she says she's going to support  roe v. wade, those are the  things she's going to do. on the other side --  >> you can't have it clear. running for president every  single time --  >> running for president by not  being donald trump. >> yeah, she's running against  something instead of for  something. so if she was to win, to govern  would be very difficult. and, look, i think everybody is  missing the wrong polls. this is a very close race. there's no undecided voter  anymore. it's whatever candidate is able  to get out the low-propensity  voters. only interesting bowl is gallup. they don't know who you're  voting for, they ask who do you  identify, republican or  democrat. for the very first time,  republicans beat democrats. by three points. you see the disparity between  republican and democrat, usually three or five points, you can  tell who wins the presidency. the second question they asked,  who was best to solve the  problem in the future,  republicans. it's a better climate,  republicans should be performing better. and it all inches down to  pennsylvania. and pennsylvania is tied right  now. if you look back four years ago, biden was winning in  pennsylvania right now by a high number. if you look at wisconsin, biden  was winning wisconsin by six  points but only won it by 20,000 votes. so you can't play into the polls that are in the margin of error. what do they mean? and is trump still getting the  underpoint that he's made  before. >> there's a possibility that  there's a massive undercount  going on we saw it in 2016 and  2020. >> could you even ask for more  fairness -- i'll make one point, the outrage machine for elon  musk for now endorsing trump is  out of control. now, twitter is still a free  exchange of ideas from both  sides. on the other hand, ""the new york times"" just endorsed kamala  harris. that's the 17th straight  democrat ""the new york times""  has endorsed since dwight d.  eisenhower. that was the last time, that was 1956. take your pick of any democrat  you want to go along the way. they've endorsed every single  one. >> mondale over reagan. >> the arbiter of all truth and  all fair, journalistic  integrity, in the world, does  that every year. not a word is spoken about --  >> can i just say something? there's --  >> okay, but what about the 17  times --  >> an editorial page of the  newspaper --  >> okay. >> i understand that. there's a news page. if you want to the conflate  them, you can go ahead and --  >> i am conflating them. >> i understand that. >> i see the choice of -- look,  there's an overriding viewpoint  from the ""times"" and everywhere, andrew. not just the op-ed page. 17 straight. >> theres what an editorial --  but it was an editorial page. i just don't understand --  >> you don't think the rest of  the paper --  >> no, and i'm not going to  engage in that with you. >> do you ever feel like a  divorced child? >> no, you cannot deny it, i  think the arbiter of ""the new  york times"" -- your overall  point which you bring into the  news conversation every day --  >> right. >> the overall point that you  bring into the news conversation every day is one of a  conservative republican who is  explicitly supporting this  president. that's a distinction. >> i'm talking about at this  point, elon musk has suddenly  totally left -- keith goldman  said he needs to leave the  country. and x shut down. >> i think the point that joe is making, you get treated  differently if you come out and  endorse trump. people loved elon before. i think overall, as americans,  we've got to get to a point  where we can respect somebody's  differences of opinion, right? you may have a difference of  opinion. i was just texting with somebody today that's mad at me about my  party. right? i still like the individual. i just texted back, you made me  smile. you made me laugh, right? i respect that you have a  difference of opinion, but i  want to have those discussions  and not dislike you over it. elon, we can't bring our  astronauts back from space  unless it was for elon. we just had a hurricane where  these people can't have internet unless it was for elon. if somebody from the left and  cared about the environment, the only person that developed an  electric car that everybody  loved was tesla. because it hinges on the first  amendment -- that's what got  him. >> the deal with elon and trump, his businesses will benefit  instead of --  >> no --  >> -- obviously, the preferred  candidate for elon musk is --  >> elon's preferred candidate is the constitution, more than a  person. overwhelmingly -- look, i've  known elon for more than --  before he was very wealthy. and he's always hinged","Category: Politics

Stocks mentioned: None

Key takeaways:
* Moody's director emphasizes the serious impact of hurricanes on Florida's coastline, particularly in urban areas like Tampa Bay and St. Petersburg, which have not experienced major storms in nearly a century.
* The focus is on the potential damage due to wind and storm surge, highlighting vulnerabilities in coastal properties that may not be adequately built to withstand such events.
* There's a concern about the overlap and compounded damage from Hurricane Helene and the forthcoming Hurricane Milton, stressing the challenge in assessing total damages due to the rapid succession of storms.
* Strong building codes in Florida are noted, which may help mitigate some damage, but the presence of debris and previous storm effects makes recovery and impact assessment complex.
* The issue of uninsured losses is significant, as many areas do not have sufficient flood insurance, potentially leading to major economic tolls. The cone of uncertainty extends from Tampa to Fort Myers, signaling that a vast area could be impacted by the storm's effects."

Stock mentioned: Amazon

Key takeaways:
* Amazon is highlighted as a top pick in large-cap and mega-cap categories due to anticipated ongoing margin expansion in both retail and AWS (Amazon Web Services) businesses.
* Amazon's advertising business is estimated to have high margins, similar to those of Google and Meta, with ad revenue running at about $50 billion.
* Strategic pivots have been made by Amazon, including a stronger focus on media and entertainment, and integrating ads into Amazon Prime Video, potentially driving profitability.
* Amazon went through a major capex cycle but is now expected to gain from rising capital utilization, contributing to margin expansion.
* AWS is seen as an essential business component for many companies but is not entirely recession-resistant, as a majority of Amazon's retail business is consumer discretionary.
* There are some headwinds, such as Amazon's investment in the Kuiper satellite project, but the market may give the company the benefit of the doubt if the costs and revenue opportunities are well-articulated.
* The potential impact of an economic recession on Amazon's growth is noted as a concern due to its reliance on consumer discretionary spending."
