Ro Khanna on DOJ-Google antitrust case, child online safety concerns and 2024 election",2024-10-09 14:00:35+00:00,9,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izf6cbDsJPY,">>> now less than four weeks  until election day. a look at the state of the  campaign, money and politics and more we welcome congressman ro  khanna. a democrat from california. 17th district. located in the heart of silicon  valley. he's a surrogate for the  harris-walz campaign. thanks for joining us. actually, ro, a, chongman,  ro-joe, all the congestion  about, about maybe doing  something. had a -- we had a minute, a  moment, when they weren't sure  what to do. i think it passed us by, and now we know that, the two sides are  set in who they're -- earlier we talked about silicon valley  being a little bit different. an interesting piece. what do you work for? ""new yorker,"" ""new york  magazine."" >> wrote a story for ""the new  yorker."" you deal with it all the time  where the tech titans are coming down and more, at least a few  now, aren't afraid to say ""the  ""t"" word out in silicon valley. and talk google. all under your purview. do you agree? >> the biggest --  >> that's a no, then.  >> biggest news our google won  the nobel prize. two of folks win the nobel  prize. two people have done more than  probably any politician in  congress. at&t, bell labs, won nine nobel  prizes. i am for sense tab restrictions. google shouldn't have dealing  with apple, and the idea break  them up especially with chatgpt  has over 100 million users. they're having the most  competition today than ever  before. doesn't make sense.  >> and how do you think it  plays -- if it took years, the  market always moves by the time  they get around to things.  >> by the time they break it th  up, there will be some other  a.i. company. >> which, initially, you would  think that regulators might say, in the past, we've seen that by  the time we enact these things,  the horse has -- the toothpaste  is out of the tube and there's  a -- the market cures a lot of  these monopolistic trends,  right? >> and have more narrow,  tailored solutions. why wouldn't you want the search profits invested in deep mind so we can have more nobel laureates discovering human proteins? there's a reason bell labs was  so successful. now, have them not play fair and have a competition, but just  this idea, break them up, to me, it doesn't make sense. >> how about, you up to speed on this roblox? we read it yesterday and  couldn't believe some of the  stuff we were reading. >> there, i think, needs to be  regulation. you've got hundreds of millions  of kids on these platforms. i had moms in my office who had  lost children because of the  choking challenge online,  because they're getting fentanyl online. here, of course, you've got  these video games where kids are being preyed on. there's a kids online safety  act. there are only 15 members of  congress on the house who are on that bill. we've got to pass that. the senate wants to pass that. >> why is that so hard to pass? i don't understand that. >> this is where i do think  there's the lobbying that the  ""new yorker"" article mentioned  but if the guy from silicon  valley can say, let's protect  our kids, all it says is, age  verification. you've got a standard to protect children. you have to make sure that  you're protecting against  predators. >> who is pushing back on that? >> look, i think there are some  tech lobbyists who are pushing  back on it. >> is that coming from roblox,  meta? who's the prime mover here? >> i think there are groups that are some funded by meta, and  they make arguments that i don't think hold water. they say, well, if you're lgbtq, you need the internet, but you  know what the bullying is more  for lgbtq kids online, three  times than it is for non-lgbtq  kids, and all the kids online  safety act is saying, age  verification, protect children,  make sure there's a standard of  harm. so, i think this is a case,  really, where tech lobbyists  need to be defeated and let's  pass the bill. >> let's get back to -- we'll  talk the campaign at this point, and there are, you know,  competing plans for how to not  kill the goose that lays the  golden egg that you love so much out in silicon valley, and we've had some on make a pretty good  case, joe lawnsdale or even elon musk, for a light touch on  regulation and taxes for the  silicon valley titans. do you prefer what -- tell me  the best thing kamala harris is  proposing to help the  entrepreneurs in silicon valley? a 28% corporate tax rate? >> the best thing is she's  proposing is massive investments in science and technology. silicon valley was built on the  investments made by darpa, by  nih, nsf, a lot of the  technology was commercialized,  and she's saying we've got to  continue to invest this and  we've got to invest in a.i. and  the public research on a.i. >> do you think the government,  i guess, taxing people to raise  money to give to technology or  to do research is better than  just getting out of the way with regulations for silicon valley? >> well, we need sensible  regulations to protect our kids. >> okay. >> to make sure -- look, on an  a.i. chatgpt, you don't want  someone asking it, how do you  commit suicide? make sure there's regulation. how do you make a nuclear bomb? >> why raise the tax rate to 28% and then subsidize through the  government for research and  development? it just -- you're taking away on the one hand and then adding and getting the government involved  on the other. just let them do it. >> this is why we've got --  >> let them do it at 21%. >> because you're along looking  at investment that's ten years  down the line. making transformative investment and change is something our  government is good at. our tax receipts are only 17% of gdp right now. in the '90s, it was around 20%. this idea that we are overtaxed  is empirically not true. >> we did have some record  receipts this year, 11% revenues at the same time the spending  went went up 11% so we're  running a $2 trillion deficit. do you think it makes sense to  spend more than we're spending  now and tax more to pay for it? >> let's look at where we can  bring down spending. one place is to be smarter on  defense. we've got all these legacy  industries, five prime  contractors. why don't we have some of the  defense tech compete? look at the f-35. lockheed had an exclusive  contract, $1.7 trillion, cost  o overruns. let's look at areas where we can bring down costs. i'm all for that. we disagree on taxation. i want to tax some of these  folks more. >> we've come up with the  current -- it's probably the  sorkin plan. i think you had it first, taxing some of the loans. >> i read his op-ed in the  ""times."" >> is that where you got it? >> i get all my ideas from other people. it was a reasonable plan. i said if sorkin's for it, you  know? >> that's after you came on and  said the unrealized capital  gains was probably not a great  position. then you got yelled at. >> yeah, because it's not a  smart position. that's not the way to go after  taxes. >> but it's a surrogate -- as a  surrogate, you're not supposed  to come on and disagree with  what you're supposed to be  saying here, ro. >> i represent the valley. one of the things in the valley, people say, why are some people  moving away from the democratic  party? one of the things they value is  the free exchange of ideas where you're willing to say what you  believe, where you can criticize folks and not just be party  line, and i think that that's  what built this country, this ","Category: Politics

Jtz5S5QxeM0,"Mid-cap stocks are a better hedge in the near term than small caps, says BofA's Jill Carey Hall",2024-10-09 13:53:31+00:00,7,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jtz5S5QxeM0,"get back to the markets. just under an hour to go until  the opening bell on wall street. our next guest likes midcaps in  the near term. joining us now is the head of  u.s. small and mid-cap  strategies and senior strategist for bank of america research. why midcaps? >> think about fed cutting  obviously this is, supposed to  be positive for small caps. actually underperformed since  the 50 basis point cut. the reason ithink a lot of  investors are looking for  fundamentals for smaller  companies and stuck in an  earnings recession. we haven't seen that recovery to positive growth the way we've  seen for larger stocks. i think mid-caps could be a  better hedge for the near term. they've seen better earnings  trends and still done well  historically and often times  better than small caps following the initial fell rate cuts  initially. those who want to spell it down  better than small caps now.  >> yesterday somebody told us  small businesses still pay about 10% interest on average to get a loan. even though the fed cut rates at this point. is is that mart of the thesis? for a small business still takes a while even after the fed cuts  rates for that to trickle down.  >> certainly some small  businesses and others may be  more tied to the fed funds rate. one isn't going to resolves  small cap space, half their  debt, short term or floating  rate. so the more rate cuts we get,  the more that helps to mitigate  the refinancing risk that a lot  of these companies face, but  there's also sector specifics  that are sectors like real  estate and tech within small  caps even if we get a handful of rate cuts still face a lot of  refinancing risk.  >> are there sectors you like  within the mid-caps too? >> i think overall. within both small and mid-caps  this is an environment where you want to focus on themes or  styles. even more so than sectors,  because within small caps even  though we've still been cautious given the fundamental backdrop,  in a soft landing, our base  case, and if we're in an  environment the data holds up,  the fed's cutting rates. if we see revision trends and  corporate commentary turn around then maybe later this year once  we get past the election, could  be a better environment for  small caps. usually volatility, stays high  ahead of that. for now focusing on stocks with  positive rather than negative  revisions have been rewarded. higher quality stocks, and even  stocks that have dividend yields because as the fed's cutting  rates that should drive money  out of the shorter duration and  into equity income.  >> are there -- issues that you  see with -- i guess the economy  coming on? a lot of discussions this  morning about whether the  economy is starting to turn  down? whether it's more complicated? what does it look like from your perspective? >> overall, certainly in a weak  macro environment recently,  which is one the reasons  corporate earnings may see this  quarter, will see reacceleration after this quarter, and i think  when you look at the balance of  data, we're still expecting the  u.s. to stay out of recession. obviously the reasons data in  terms of gdp revisions and jobs  data recently is encouraging. we'll see if that continues. we track a regime indicator on  our team and that, after being  in a more positive phase for  much of the year turned down  into more of a downturn phase  the last two months, which tends to be a phase you don't want to  earn small caps and risky. tilt it up and stick with  quality and volatile in  underlying components.  >> and from apollo saying he did not think there should be  additional cuts on interest  rates because he thought the  company was doing so well, so  well it was a mistake to cut  interest rates. shocking from a person who's in  the private equity business in  large part who you would think  wants interest rates to be low  as humanly possible? >> yeah. i think the rate cuts, for the  overall market, corporates have  been able to adapt to higher  rates, and especially for large  cap stocks. they've been able to do well in  this environment, we've been in  an environment where the economy has held up. a year ago many expected  recession. we managed to stay out of that. i still think for small caps the biggest focus and one of the  biggest reasons we saw a big  rally in july and in the  russell. investors were focused on the  fed as a catalyst for smaller  companies given how much  investors were focused on  refinancing of these companies'  space. smaller company, that's really  where the issue lies, since  large caps have been able to  adapt ux and particularly for  some sectors.  >> if the labor market really is the slightest bit indicating  some weakness, i can understand  it, but if it's just to keep  the, if the default move is to  keep the punch bowl going,  because people love easy money,  or because you're worried  about --  >> the point, look theal at it . the rick, go in the other  direction. not a good day.  >> i mean, why i was thinking  the fedor market. what was the 50 all about? the last 20 years, addicted. love the wall street traders. low interest rates. you don't need them save it for  when you do need it.  >> that suggests, things aren't  very good. underlying piece of it, given  the number of people --  >> but the fed seems to be  thinking that it's -- i don't  know. a losery, that it's so good. i don't know.  >> and fed is cutting into  accelerating corporate profit  cycle, frequently happens, maybe inflationary. within our overall equity market yot look and within ","Category: Macro

Stocks mentioned: None explicitly mentioned, but discussion includes small caps, mid-caps, and large-cap stocks.

Key takeaways:
* Mid-caps are favored for the near term due to better earnings trends compared to small caps.
* Small caps are currently underperforming due to an earnings recession and high refinancing risks, especially in sectors like real estate and tech.
* The current macro environment is weak, but there is optimism for a reacceleration of corporate earnings soon.
* A soft landing and ongoing rate cuts by the Fed could create a later environment favorable for small caps, particularly after the election.
* Large-cap stocks have adapted well to higher interest rates and have performed well without a recession.
* Discussions about the appropriateness of interest rate cuts at this time, with some experts arguing that higher rates have been manageable for large corporations.
* Fed rate cuts have been a significant focus for investors, particularly concerning refinancing risks faced by smaller companies.
* Mixed sentiments about the economy’s performance, with overall avoidance of recession seen as positive."

a majestic rocky mountains, a  quiet tree-lined street and a  modest light gray home. not the kind of place you'd  imagine an investigation into  black market ozempic would lead, but it did.  our look into counterfeit  weight-loss drugs started with  purchasing ozempic online from  labor beauty, a company we  thought was based in colorado. what we found was that its part  of about international  marketplace where criminals are  brazenly counterfeiting these  drugs or buying the real things  overseas on the cheap and  illegally shepping them to the  u.s. to turn a profit. the main targets, novo nordisk  diabetes drug, wegovy and  mounjaro and zepbound in a class of popular weight-loss drugs  known at glp-1s. they cost $219 and real ozempic  cost $21 for a month's supply. they claim they're located in  boldululder, colorado, but we s  this off an elevator behind an  unmarked door right to us at  cnbc headquarters in new jersey. >> let's open it up and see what we have. a plain cardboard box. doesn't appear to have any  refrigeration, although it's  supposed to be refrigerated. looks like might have been  refrigeration pack at one point  although it's warm now. it says ozempic on it. 1 milligram, here's the novo  nordisk logo and the pen. looks like the real thing. let's see what's inside.  >> reporter: was real  ozempic?

the home owners told us they  have no connection to the  chinese ozempic seller at all. labor beauty not respond to our  request for comment. the day after sending that  request the colorado address was scrubbed from the website.  >> and that address in boulder,  colorado, a sales rep told us  what'sup the previous address of their u.s. wear fouse. clearly a home in a  neighborhood. law enforcement tell us the  ozempic received from china is  connected to an ongoing federal  investigation into ozempic  packages shipped into the united states. by the way, this is jut a small  part of it. watch the full investigation  scanning the qr code on the  screen with your phone or go to  cnbc.com, back slash, ozempic  underworld.  >> raises huge questions if you  ordered this from outside. you wonder what you're getting. what's in it if it's not the  actual thing?

a judge to force the company to  divest parts of its business  like chrome, the browser on  android operating system saying  the services are used by google  to maintain an illegal monopoly  on online search. founder and managing partner  at -- you need to be able to  look deep into the future to  even have this discussion, i  think. right? should we even bother? should we try? it would be years before we  actually see what comes of this. right? >> that's the main point. probably reporting on this about three years early. it takes a while. the who major topics to follow  on this that are relevant,  microsoft from 10, 20 years and  ibm 10 20, 20 years before that. both companies resulted in  nothing. no breakup. no major change. remember, the doj did say today  that they would seek a number of remedies including, up to and  including the most extreme  bakeup. it's possible more modest  changes could appear. one would be this, right? so right now chrome is embedded, the default position on a number of platforms, samsung and so  forth, across the internet and  across hardware. you can imagine something as  simple as when you turn on your  machine for the first time or  tenth time or nth time you're  prompted to ask which browser do you need to use? google if propose that and doj  could accept. the big user is for google. after all of these many decades  of extraordinary story, the  storied company, google,  alphabet, it remains basically a one-trick pony. the revenue. the profit. the enormous success of google  comes down to ten blue links at  associated and search revenue. their ox could be gored but a  lox time before we really know  what's going to happen.  >> and google, it would point to the judge's acknowledgement,  people use google. very high quality. again, you point out why does it cost billions of dollars then -- >> that's it. the judge here a very smart guy  calls himself by the way, a  hip-hop kind of sir. he found google to be  monopolist, law, his ruling,  fact finding hard to give a  return, found that google search quality very high perhaps  highest. google has come out swinging  with their public defense. it's definitely going to be, we  are the best and in the best  position because we are the best at search. now, of course if that were the  only reason why would google  spend billions? billions with a b, getting these default position contracts on  platforms like samsung and so  forth? but i do think that, that is  going to be the public defense. we know that. an interesting other tidbit  about this for viewers, your  viewers, is that the u.s. and  the eu seem to be marching in  lockstep on this google  antitrust. about a year ago european  anti-trust force called google,  alphabet and five other  companies, five of the six  american, five chinese and one  european. six companies so-called  gatekeepers to the internet,  digital life and google is one  of them. this means no major way to get  to an onroad to the internet as  company or competitor challenger without going through these  companies to reach the end  consumer. a year later now, after the  judge fact-finding ruling in  august, the doj is saying, we,  too, believe this is such a  severe gatekeeping fact, perhaps one of the only way is to get  the internet's blood to flow  again avoiding sclerosis is a  possible breakup. i don't predict a breakup. i predict, my own personal  prediction, i predict it will be half measures, intermediate  measures and eventually the  market will cure this is. we've seen recent reporting  google's dominance in search is  finally challenged after many  decades by the growth of a.i.  and, of course, platforms like  tiktok, which as you know, i  believe to be digital fentanyl. even search dominance is being  challenged.  >> michael, my big question. are regulators fighting last  decade's war, if you will? which is, if you believe that  openai and complexity and claude and xai will provide the answers and break the blue link model,  what are we talking about here? >> a very good question. why is it regulators are so good at fighting the last war? so good at fighting the last  war. in the wrap-up to the last war,  which in fact was microsoft, the circuit court of appeals in that case, overturned findings of knoplistic breakup, the sherman  law, antitrust, was not devised  to cope with software. devised for age of vertical and  dieing a neale -- diagonal  companies, steege companies, i  believe they're camping up with  this war and i think by the  time -- catching up with this  war and by the time the future  rolls on you will see google  search will be less dominant. i think better for google's  business to inanovate and it  could be as impressive as --  >> that's almost -- you know --  an anathema to the regulators? >> certainly lina khan doesn't  like aqcquisition believes  everything should be the way it  is back in stone age. i agree. the note they're sounding now  and i wish lina khan would  change her mind. she underestimates the chilling  effect that her ftc antitrust  policy has had on investment in  silicon valley. america's silicon valley is tip  of the spear of the global  economy and i don't believe lina khan and her team appreciate  making acquisitions very  difficult they are  disincentivizing business.  >> embarrassed in i was eu. going after -- yeah, we have  none that we're developed here. >> there are a lot of reasons  for eu to be embarrassed. it's a continent of 500 million  people, european union and don't have a single new idea. embarrassing. instead of attacking american  compan","Category: Other

>> yeah. it's unfortunate that we're  still having this conversation. it's a false narrative, and it's just a distraction to what we're doing here on the ground. just because you don't see  somebody in a fema shirt walking around a community doesn't mean  fema's not there. much of the water and food  that's been delivered into these communities came from our  warehouses. we have experts from the army  corps of engineers and the  department of defense that are  on the ground helping out in  these communities. and we've had staff embedded at  the state eoc side-by-side with  the state and we understand the  needs and meet the needs and get the resources in place. we've been on the ground since  the storm passed through  appalachia, still here and will  be here long as needed to meet  the needs of all of these  communities.  >> is this an example of a storm that's just so big and so  powerful and has such a wide  swath through so many states --  it's hard to imagine being able  to put everything back together  very quickly? >> i mean, this was definitely a historic storm. it hit six different states, and each state had a different type  of impact. right? when we look what it did in  florida with the storm surge and the wind. we look at, in georgia, where it was primarily the damage from  the wind and a lot of downed  power lines from trees. but then in all the states in  appalachia, that flash flooding. all of them have very different  risks but we have had personnel  across all the states impacted. i have leadership teams embedded with all of the governors' teams to ensure we're continuing to  meet their needs and we're still preparing and pre-positioning  resources to support florida for hurricane milton. >> president trump has, former  president trump, has been  critical as well talking about  how families in emergency can  only get $750 for some of the  things that have come through. there's been criticism from lots of political angles, but what  does that do to your job on the  ground, and is it true? >> well, let me just set the  record straight on the $750  first. right? we know some people have  immediate needs. they need to replace medicine,  maybe buy clothes. official food and water. that's an initial financial  assistance to help them meet  those immediate needs in the  beginning, but as people  register and get that funding  we're also giving reimbursement  for repairs, for damages  incurred in their home, or lost  belongings, if they incur costs  when they evacuated and  displaced. right? we also have a hotel program  where we're putting people into  hotels that have been impacted. a lot of resources. these types of programs will  continue to support individuals  that were impacted throughout  this response and the recovery  effort. and where it impacts is that it  creates distrust, and i need  people to apply for this  assistance so we can actually  get them the resources they're  eligible for and desperately  need.  >> what happens to homeowners  whose homes were flooded, they  didn't have flood insurance, as  was the case in many, many, many homes that were damaged in north carolina and other places. what can you do for them? what will be allowed to be done? are they ever going to be able  to come back to their properties and think of rebuilding? >> yeah. i mean, insurance is certainly  the first place that we want  people to go, but we know that a lot of people did not have flood insurance, and that's where our  programs come in and theyhelp  jump-start the recovery process  for them. we can give them funding to help with the repairs to their homes. we can give them funding to help replace things like their  refrigerators or other  appliances. or a lost vehicle, if it was  their primary vehicle. we'll also be working -- i'm  sorry. go ahead.  >> how long does it take for  that process? people, who for two weeks, their world's in turmoil. how long does it take to get  things like that done? >> we've already given out  several max grants to  individuals that had damages to  their homes, and so as they  register, and as we validate the damages to their home and we use things like aerial imagery so we don't need somebody to go  in-person. that money is already flowing  out to the communities and the  last number this morning was  over $35 million here in north  carolina alone has gone out into individuals hands, into their  bank accounts so they can start  that process.  >> how are preparations going  for the latest, with hurricane  milton coming in? >> yeah. we're expecting, again, just  another historic storm now to  hit the west coast of florida. three years in a row they've  been hit by these major storms,  but this one is going to be, i  think, unlike any of those. it's going to be a very strong,  dangerous storm with significant storm surge and a major met pra  pau  -- metropolitan area. i was anble to meet with the  mayor and checking quickly on  initial needs from recovery on  helene and concern preparing for this storm. getting out of the storm's path  is most important piece. i believe people still have some time to get out of harm's way. the storm surge is what we're so worried about. you don't have to go far. we want people to just move out  of those evacuation zones, but  we are prepared to help support  the state of florida with the  efforts they're all right  putting in place. we have over 1,200 search and  rescue personnel from our teams  as well as the department of  defense, the coast guard as well as other federal partners that  have vehicles and aircraft that  will be able to go in and  support the state with all of  those initial search and  recovery efforts to help them as this storm passes. we're sending in additional  resources as well, same things  that we sent","Category: Other

vIiUUPfN_Wk,Rep. Jodey Arrington on U.S. budget deficit: The wheels are coming off the wagon,2024-10-09 12:41:24+00:00,9,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIiUUPfN_Wk,"box."" according to the latest report  from the nonpartisan  congressional budget office, the federal budget deficit has hit  $1.8 trillion, with a trc, the  highest level in three years. we're getting this news as  economists try to parse the  presidential candidates' plans  to see how much they would add  or maybe hopefully subtract at  some point, but i don't think  this is part of it. joining us now, house budget  committee chairman jodey  arrington. >> good morning, andrew.  >> $6 billion a day is the cost. >> unsustainable. at some point, we're going to  run out of other people's money  and the people we're borrowing  from, some of our foreign  creditors like japan and china,  by the way, will stop loaning us money to pay for an ever-growing government where we have almost  $2 trillion in an annual  deficit. if you look over ten years,  we're going to add over $20  trillion to the national debt. we're paying over 50 cents on  every dollar just to service the debt. that's more than we spend on all of national defense, that cost  is almost a trillion dollars,  that's more than we're spending  on medicare now. so, the wheels are coming off  the wagon, and we have to have a plan to reduce our spending,  stabilize the debt by just  growing faster than we're  spending, and getting back to  economic growth. >> this would have been a good  year to do it, because revenue  was up 11%. >> yeah. we have seen record revenue, by  the way. >> corporate revenue up 26%. but spending was up --  >> there is a great chart on the front of ""the wall street  journal.""  >> if we grow 1% --  >> we have been outspending  every single year.  >> we have. but, look, the foundation is  always going to be growth. we had over 3% gdp prior to  covid. and if we grow 1% over what cbo  projects, the ten-year annual  gdp average, which is 2%, paulty 2% --  >> but how do we grow and end,  are we going to have a real  conversation about cutting? because i was going to say, in  terms of cutting spending,  neither candidate on the  presidential end of things and  very few in the senate and the  congress seem to be talking  about cutting anything ever. >> yeah. yeah, well, i think there are  two myths on each side of the  equation, politically. one party thinks you can tax  your way out of this deficit  hole and you can't. you'll run out of other people's money as margaret thatcher says  and you'll destroy the economy,  quite frankly. this is the worst time to  consider adding taxes on our job creators or our families  suffering with the worst and  most progressive tax of  inflation. at the same time, there is a  myth on the republican side,  that we can just grow out of  this $2 trillion soon to double  in the next ten years, et  cetera, et cetera. about 130 trillion over next 30  years, won't happen. we won't get there if we don't  rein in -- so we have to combine the cuts.  >> nobody wants to have the cut  conversation. >> i do. i do. >> if i said to you, where do  you cut? >> listen, let's start with  unspent billions of dollars of  covid, let's start with tens of  billions in funding for --  >> where is that money, by the  way? you read this headline, there is $200 billion, all this money  from covid that has been  unspent, where is that money? >> well, it is like the money  we're spending on illegal  immigrants. it is housing. it is healthcare. it is welfare. >> it is spent or unspent? people say this is like the  covid money is unspent? >> appropriated but not spent.  >> okay. >> it is just billions, but  there are tens of billions in  spending. in fact, it is 9,000 per illegal immigrant on -- cbo did a  report, $16 billion on medicaid  spending. this was last week. i can go through a list --  >> i also saw some new data,  which surprised me and i don't  know what you do about it. the cost of removing illegal  aliens from this country could  be astronomical as well, which  we have not figured out.  >> put that in the deficit  plans, why trump -- but we're  not talking about cutting right  now. on the trump side, no tax on  social security, no tax on tips, no-noel -- it is crazy. do you know what this new  entitlement for home healthcare  would cost? it is $288,000 a year for people to be -- you add to that $25,000 for down payment on houses,  $3600 child tax credit, $6,000  baby bonus, universal pre-k and  paid family leave. that's not cutting spending,  those are layering all this new  spending, i don't know how much  i just mentioned.  >> that's complete new spending. but there is the other argument  on the other side --  >> i said that, but --  >> not just that, you got  tariffs and what does that do to the economy and how much can you collect in taxes? >> we'll ask ro khanna this. if we had 26% higher corporate  revenues, why do we need to  screw with that and go up to  28%, on the corporate tax rate? >> i think trump has a list of  things i would say are a  starting point for negotiations. >> i'm not saying -- he wants to go down to 15. >> that's right. >> she wants to go up to 28.  >> do you think that going to 15 is the right answer? given what you just laid out --  >> these are a list of proposals for consideration. what we have to do is keep taxes low, keep our businesses  competitive. how that shakes out in terms of  any one provision is --  >> i'm asking you specifically,  all of these are specific. if i said to you, 15%, would you vote in favor of 15%? >> i'm more interested in  locking in permanent tax breaks  for small businesses that will  expire next year, like the 20%  deduction, the 199a for small  businesses, where kamala harris  and her tax proposal would allow that to expire and then when she says she's not going to tax  anybody making less than  $400,000, that's not true. there is 1.5 million businesses  that gross, as you know, well  over 400,000, but they don't  take home 400,000. >> if you go to 28, you add in  state, that would be some of the highest in the world.  >> exactly. >> what i'm saying is this, and  can you have both ideas in your  head and say them publicly, that the harris plan as it relates to taxes and small businesses may  not be good. 15% may be too low? can you say that aloud? >> just for --  >> i'm saying that --  >> we're having a fair  conversation.  >> we need the lowest rates to  have our job creators have the  most competitive posture  vis-a-vis their --  >> would you go to zero? >> we need, by the way, we need  the lowest tax rates on our  families who are -- whose wages  have been burned through by  inflation.  >> would you only do it for  companies that do it here? that's like weird corporate --  >> here is the point. >> isn't that industrial policy? >> here's the point, you can  keep taxes low, but you have to  reduce spending commensurately. you have to bring down the  structural imbalance in our  mandatory spending which is 75%  of the budget. you can't just defer the tax,  which is what increased deficits are, a deferred tax on our  children.  >> my question to you,  therefore, is your candidate is  former president trump. >> yes.  >> do you believe there are  plans --  >> yes.  >> -- that he has articulated  that would bring down -- not  just grow the economy, but bring down the costs and the spending  piece? you're aware of those? and what are those? >> well, i can tell you that  he's talked about this  efficiency commission with elon  musk. and i can assure you that  starting with 236 billion in  waste and fraud and healthcare  and welfare entitlements, there  is -- this guy runs a business. he understands you got to clean  up your balance sheet. he knows how much waste is in  the federal govern","Category: Macro

_lk8wzYc8NQ,U.S. Amb. to Japan Rahm Emanuel: U.S. has allowed commercial interests to occupy national security,2024-10-09 12:27:28+00:00,8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lk8wzYc8NQ,"street journal,"" rahm emanuel,  the u.s. ambassador to japan is  focusing on china's strategy of  economic coercion. ambassador emanuel writes today, we can further isolate china by  confronting beijing's economic  tactics, where its determination to dominant is most apparent. it uses coercion, americaen  tillism and debt trap diplomacy  to crush competition and control countries. the u.s. ambassador to japan  joins us this morning to talk  about it. thank you very much for being  here. china is front and center on our minds. we spend a lot of time talking  about it in relation to what we  have seen with the economic  policies and most recently with  the stimulus that has been  boosting the stock markets until today. but what you lay out is a very  real way of looking at diplomacy and how we deal with them. how would you describe this  entire thought process? >> well, mainly a couple for us  here, which is one on the  political, you try to always  look at what i would say  opposition of your opponent, in  this case, china, is doing and  then flipping in what is  considered a strength by then a  weakness. their attempt is to isolate  country a, philippines,  australia, et cetera, using  coercion or the mercantilism. president biden with the tri  lats between korea, japan and  the united states or on the  philippine front, we have done  it on the security multilateral  going to a more lattice work,  multilateral approach. they're giving us huge  opportunities. australia showed, as i laid out, how to beat back the coercion. it was through expanding trade  and economic opportunities to  other countries to the point  that china just threw in the  towel. that is how lithuania did it  with the eu. that example, you apply not only on the coercion front, but --  chile had to close their steel  plant because of a massive  dumping of cheap steel by china. that's going to give us a huge  opportunity into the developing  economic world where the united  states can be a center of an  economic system where their  industry, whether that's on the  steel side or higher end or ev  side is protected. so we need to bring our economic state craft in line  strategically so what you're  doing diplomatically, from a  security standpoint and economic point has a single effort of  deterrence. that is what we did during the  cold war. now it has to be applied here. >> how has china reacted to this partnership that is built up  from the hub and spoke situation to be pushed back. you mention the situation with  canberra, they spoke out about  china and wanting to know the  origins of what really happened  with covid. how does china react to  australia, then turning around  and saying, okay, we have all  these other trade partners  instead? >> i think the proof is that  after three years of really  trying to isolate australia and  maximizing economic  opportunities and economic  markets in other countries,  china through in the towel. exactly what happened with  lithuania and the eu. we need to be the center of  gravity on this anticoercion  operation. the last g-7 held here in may,  that actually, for the first  time in g-7 talked about  coercion. you have to have a strategy, an  alignment, be able to identify  what coercion is, i would argue  what russia did to europe on  using energy, that's a form of  economic coercion. so my view is economic coercion  is one piece. the mercantilism where you  destroy other countries'  industrial base is another form  of their economic kind of  warfare. and then using debt trap to  literally take acountry's  sovereignty away from them or  infrastructure away from them. all of that, while china sees it as a strength, is actually their vulnerability and you need to  apply the same strategy of  literally using multilayered. lattice-like work, multinational efforts, where china becomes the isolated party because their  tactics is offensive  economically, politically and  securitywise to our country. think about last week, they were in conen frontation with fishin  boats. they were in japan's space and  on the coastal areas off the  islands. they're doing this all the time  to countries and the united  states had a comprehensive  integrated approach where our  strategy on the political and  diplomatic as well as security  and economic front is  collaborative and cooperative  and of the same vein. >> what do you think of u.s.  companies doing business in  china? is it a good place to do  business, and should they be  allowed to? >> they can do business there. i won't leave myself -- i grew  up in a time where cost  inefficiencies was the issue. i think u.s. companies who do  that, that's up to them. it is a big market. but i will tell you, you know,  china demands of the united  states companies that they turn  over their research. i'm sorry, your r&d, u.s.  taxpayers subsidize that r&d. you're not allowed to turn over  the family jewels just to have a market access. we fund that. and i just think for too long  the united states is allowed  commercial interests to occupy  our national security. in 2012, when --  >> how do we fund the r&d? >> tax credits. they take a tax deduction for  it.  >> we take a tax deduction, you  should be held to higher  standards? >> i don't think you should be  in the position, not just higher standards, i don't think you  would be in a position turning  over your research to china. and china often, very  frequently, participates in  intellectual property theft and  also economic espionage. there is a case with google, a  case with asml in holland. that is part of their modus  operandi. they make that a core piece of  their economic strategy. tokyo electron competes against  asml in the semiconductor  industry. they don't try to steal ideas,  intellectual property theft. and you shouldn't be in the  position if you want access to  the market you have to turn over your research. and your company's kind of basic core strategic advantage. that is part of the access. you can do it as a company,  we're not going to ban them. but we have to understand  something. we held on to this view for too  long that china was a strategic  competitor. china adopted the view they are  a strategic ed avadversary.","Category: Politics

KS23cw8rF38,Carson Daly on mental health: The best thing that's ever happened was when I got diagnosed,2024-10-09 12:27:10+00:00,7,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS23cw8rF38,"tomorrow project healthy minds  is going to be hosting its  annual world mental health day  and festival that in the gala  that they're holding in new york city. those events are going to be  featuring thought leaders and  celebrities like demi lovato and chance the rapper, but joining  us right now to talk about it is carson daly, the host of ""the  voice"" and co-host for ""today,""  he's hosting the festival's  gala. we're joined by phil schermer,  the ceo and founder of project  healthy minds. gentlemen, welcome to both of  you.  >> thank you, becky. thank you for having us.  >> thank you for being here. phil, let's talk about what this project is and what it is  bringing? >> at the core of what healthy  minds does, 60% don't know where to go to find help and the core  of what we do is build a digital platform to help connect  americans to mental healthcare  and our world mental health day  festival and gala, as you know,  stigma is an enormous issue in  america and it is about creating one place for thought leaders to talk about meanntal way.  >> you've created like an  expedia where people can find  the best ways to get t mental  healthcare they need.  >> we talk about it as an open  table or expedia for finding  mental health services. it should be as easy to find  mental health services in  america in 2024 as it is to book a flight or hotel. >> let's talk about how you two  met. in 2017? >> my mental health journey is  one i hadn't talked about until  we did a piece on kevin love,  who wrote an article about  having a panic attack during an  nba basketball game. i said, this -- i said to craig, this happened to me at mtv years ago, i had this exact  experience, he asked me about  it, i ended up talking about it  on the air and in the next month or two, my -- the producers,  everybody really reacted to that mental health story you told. it ended up being -- now it is  this work i do and i met phil on the heels of that, he came in to launch project healthy minds, he came in with a rapper named  logic who had done a song that  was the national crisis line for the national suicide hot line,  on the mtv vmas and the call for the crisis line went up and it  struck a chord with me that in  popular culture, there wasn't  this much advocacy being done in mainstream and it seemed like a  lot of people needed help. so i just jumped on board.  >> i think you telling your  story means a lot, though,  because to have a very  successful person who millions  of people watch every day and  look up to say that, yeah, i  struggled with panic attacks  too, what happened, how did it  come about? >> i feel like -- i joked it is  like that movie ""fight club,""  where the first rule of fight  club is nobody talks about it. i grew up in the '80s, i didn't  discuss mental health. one stat we always like to tout  is that the time that elapses  between somebody who has a  mental health symptom and when  they go out and get help, that  time period is 11 years. >> can you, for the audience, i  think a lot of people suffer  from either anxiety or  depression or panic, but they  don't know. they don't know -- they don't  know if this is actually a  mental health crisis or issue  for them or this is just a  momentary -- right? it is very hard to --  >> yes. >> self-diagnose yourself.  >> totally.  >> if you will. >> totally. i think that's one of the things that is important is it is easy  when there is a cultural stigma  around mental health. it is easy to justify to  yourself that how you might feel isn't really anything serious,  so it is easy then to put it  off. part of what we need to do, like all things in healthcare, is get people started earlier in their  journey working on their -- the  same way you work on your  physical health before you have  a health crisis.  >> we pick up a basketball game  and you roll your ankle, how  long does it take are you, like, did i break it, high sprain for  you go to urgent care. maybe two hours? but it takes people 11 years,  they suffer in silence, because  they don't know. i was having panic attacks. i dropped out of college, i'm  pretty sure when i dropped out  of college, i had a panic attack in that english class that led  me to my counselor that led me  to drop out. music saved my life. i hear music, it calms me down,  it makes me feel good. i had a career being as close to music as possible strictly  related to its relationship with me and my own mental health.  >> and did it get better once  you started --  >> yes, the best day i ever this is when i got diagnosed because  i didn't know it was a thing. i thought i was losing my  marbles, i had no idea what was  going on. i didn't know that your brain  could literally send a false  signal to your body and tell you that there is an imminent threat here and you need to get out of  this room when that actually  doesn't exist. i didn't know that was a model. i didn't know it was anything  real. >> the current state of  treatment, does it involve  psychotherapy and drugs? >> yeah. there is a whole --  >> both? >> there is a whole spectrum  from meditation to therapy,  psychiatry, in patient, peer to  peer. >> it is all mediated  clinically. if you have low  neurotransmitters, something  that will predispose you to  being depressed, you can only  fix that with helping the  chemical imbalance, right? >> yeah. >> will not be done through  therapy.  >> it can be done by all kinds  of things. i think over people's lives, you need different types of mental  health support. what you need at 22 is different than what you need at 32 or 42.  >> and there is different things too. i was talking to somebody  yesterday about acute  depression, you have something  that happens in your life that  triggers you and puts you into  that, it drops your serotonin  levels significantly. it is harder to restart that  unless you are talking to  somebody and maybe getting drugs that would boost those serotonin levels.  >> having this conversation,  this platform in society now,  popular culture, what i bring to the table, people see me, you're that dude from mtv and here you  are having a conversation about  mental health, trying to  normalize the conversation or  break the stigma. once we get to that, that's  point of all of this, project  healthy minds and our gala and  festival, the same way kevin  love or anybody else in the  press talked about michael  phelps and i talked forever  about this, simone biles, the  more people that unlock their  stories, people watching, they  can relate to that.  >> successful people coming and  talking about it --  >> if they can do it, i'll be  okay.  >> it is something that is very  open to be able to be talked  about.  >> i just love that you call  yourself that dude from mtv. i remember watching. >> i know, right here. >> i'm having flashbacks of it  right now. do you ever shut down times  square? does 'n sync ever stop by? >> no. elmo","Category: Other

Key takeaways:
* Crude prices are steady after a recent decline, largely affected by geopolitical events in the Middle East.
* The oil market is not well supplied, particularly due to seasonal high demand in August; however, additional crude oil is expected to come into the market as temperatures moderate in Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
* OPEC+ is anticipated to increase crude oil supply, adding downward pressure on prices.
* Potential conflict in the Middle East could impact oil prices, but significant escalation is deemed improbable.
* There is an expectation of lower oil prices in the future, possibly reaching the 50s or 60s dollar range due to oversupply concerns in 2025.
* Reduced investor interest is noted as money has stopped chasing the oil market, unlike in previous years."

WUwYXOIqJL8,We're seeing the Republican Party make inroads in Silicon Valley: New Yorker's Charles Duhigg,2024-10-09 12:02:11+00:00,8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUwYXOIqJL8,"box."" on the trump side you have musk, david teal, sax. joining us is a writer at new  yorker. this week he published a deep  dive into the lobbyingests  regarding crypto. it's a must-read piece. i want to get deep into  understanding what's happening  in the valley and where the  fault lies. let me start with this larger  question. do you believe fundamentally na  the politics of silicon valley  have shifted? i think there's a perception  from the headlines you have this deep divide. i mentioned certain people on  certain sides, the idea that  it's a deeply liberal place, but somehow it's shifting to be a  conservative place. are you seeing that? >> upper-level low. i think, you know, the valley is still overwhelmingly liberal. it will still overwhelmingly  voigt for the democrats. but if a few years ago you said  you liked trump, you would have  become a pariah in silicon  va valley. what we're now seeing is because of a handful of leaders who have come forward saying they're  supporting trump, voting for  him, or they're agnostic, rew  remaining on the sidelines, it's okay to say you believe in trump and the republican party. people with wealth have often  sided with the republican party, but this is different because  they're siding with trump and  that would have been unthinkable just four years ago.  >> one of the reasons i ask that question, there's part of me  that things that silicon valley  at least in the venture capital  world was at least a libertarian world. you know, peter o'toole was a  libertarian. mark would have been in a  liberal camp which might have  manifested itself as supporting  republicans, and it was always  the rank and file, if you will,  the engineers and others, who  might have had a more liberal  leaning and whether that really  has shifted the balance.  >> i think that's really fair  because i think not only are  they libertarian, they're h
o heterodots. i think the folks who are now  coming out for trooper are very  much of that camp, where  questioning assumptions is  exactly the right way to think. you're right. throughout much of the last  century what we've seen is the  owners of the companies  oftentimes side with are more  blue collar, labor focused, and  democratic. we don't see a huge difference  between the lives of the people  who own and run the companies  and the people working with them though. certainly mark andres and others are much more healthy than their workers. the workers themselves are much, much more healthy. this seems like an opportunity  for them to talk about tacks,  the issues that they know that  folks with money care about  most, and we are seeing them  make inroads. it does not mean the valley has  become liberale -- or  conservative, but it does mean  we're seeing for the first time  conversations that didn't happen before.  >> charles, let's dive deeper  into the lobbying issue, because that's where you go on this  piece, and it's fascinating to  understand pieces around crypto  and ai and the sort of extremes  -- or the -- how far folks are  going and why they're going  there, meaning speak to the  money piece of this, maybe even  the dark money piece of this.  >> yeah, absolutely. so today the tech industry is  the largest contributor to super pacs in the nation. almost half of every dollar  given by corporation to a super  pac in this election was given  by the crypto industry, and they have a very, very specific  reason why. they want crypto to be  legalized, and they're using  that money as a tool to bully  politicians, and it's being --  it's very effective. katie porter, who is running for the senate here in california, a essentially her race was blown  up because a super pac came in  and spent $10 million overnight  running ads just annihilating  her, and it worked. politicians in other places saw  this happening and they began  voting for pro-crypto bills and  agreeing and releasing  pro-crypto statements. money matters. the people with the most money  is the tech industry. as a result, they're able to  cajole, bully, and woo their way to whatever kind of naks they  see fit.  >> legalizing crypto, obviously  one issue. ai.  >> yeah.  >> what does the ai industry  actually want? we've seen a lot of leaders come to congress and do hearings and  say, they want regulation. do they actually want  regulation? >> they do. they want regulations, but they  want regulations that work for  them. in particular they want  regulations that work for the  big companies, because companies like ai are out there stumping  and lobbying. keep in mind, it's a mixing  formulation. what the ai industry wants, they want a seat at the table because they know that the regulations  that guide this industry are  going to shape everything. it's go ing to shape who are the winners, the losers, who gets to sell their products, who double. as a result, what's most  important is not only to have a  seat at the table, but to frame  this the right way. the way sam altman is framing  the current debate is this is a  competition between democratic  ai nations and authoritarian ai  nations. we want to be on the side of  right and truth and justice,  which is very, very convenient  framing ther femme. big companies versus small  companies and fast progress  versus slow and safe progress. by framing it as democratic  versus authoritarian nations,  you're saying this is a fight  between good and evil. you can ask for anything.  >> charles, if you ask ai what  it wants from washington, it  said exactly what you said. i don't know. you must be -- you're actual  intelligence. this was artificial. they said the ai industry seengs a balanced approach while  implementing it with a light  touch.  >> is that from chatgpt? >> i'm not going to say who i  used.  >> google? are you using gemini on a day  when they're going to be broken  up? >> no, i'm not using gemini.  >> okay.  >> it could have been ask  charles.  >> charles might been an ai.  >> that's a very polite way of  putting it.  >> yeah. cautious legislative approach to avoid stifling advancement. i like it.  >> it used to be silicon valley  believed politics was stupid. all they wanted is for  washington, d.c. to stay out of  their business so they didn't  screw everything up. but we're in a new world. airbnb, uber, they realize  politics is an existential risk  if you're not on top of it and  not in the conversation. sam altman w","Category: Politics

Key takeaways:
* The stock market has faced numerous challenges such as political elections, natural disasters, and industrial strikes, yet continues to hold up, suggesting the possibility of a soft landing.
* The Federal Reserve needs to be cautious with its interest rate strategy, given the difficulty in reducing core inflation due to factors like housing and natural disasters impacting insurance costs.
* There is a possibility for the Fed to gradually reduce the policy rate, considering economic indicators such as strong job numbers and reasonable GDP performance.
* Current interest payments for the U.S. are significantly high ($950 billion), highlighting the importance of managing rates to potentially reduce these costs.
* Despite the challenges, the economic conditions remain strong, which is reflected in the market's performance and the yield curve dynamics."
