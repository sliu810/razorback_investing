        "Split the trade off is we have  no manufacturing base.  we will save this for a follow- up discussion.  high rates are dashing hopes  for a bigger recovery in the  housing market pick and even  the one bright spot in recent  years, the homebuilder etf is  down 15% in the past three  months to my next guest things  that move has been sharp and  unwarranted.  john is back with us and he is  a senior homebuilder analyst at  ubs.  unwarranted?  mortgage applications were at a  30 year low. >> thank you for having me.  i think the fact of the matter  is that underlying demand is  actually pretty good.  the most recent data from our  evidence lab housing attention  survey shows 31% of buyers  intend to pull the trigger over  the next 12 months.  that is above the historical  average of 30.  the intent to buy or the  ability to buy and there are  headwinds.  but we have a lot of pent-up  demand and another built  market.  we think we will have those  single digit growth this year  with builders able to  outperform that pretty  meaningfully.  i think there is a tremendous  amount of fear in the market  right now and that is what has  been the catalyst for us to get  published typically this is the  time when the fear translates  into good opportunities for  investors.  >> the setup is strange because  we are in the middle of what is  supposed to be this fed rate  cutting cycle and traditional  you see housing start to pick  up a manufacturing start to  pick up and all the things that  benefit from lower rates but  rates on everything but  everything is one of the and  step.  for housing this will not be a  big contributor to any kind of  acceleration in growth at this  point.  >> i think you are right and i  think we are seeing the  currently with the existing  home sales that pretty much at  gf see trough levels.  the silver linings are twofold,  the public builders of the  ability to offer mortgage rate  by dell to keep the demand  going that is still there.  underlying strong basis.  that is a big advantage versus  smaller competitors and also  versus the existing home market  to the other silver lining is  there is a lot of concern about  inventory in the market and we  can sit and talk about why we  think that is overblown, but  higher rates should limit the  amount of inventory that is  coming in as the locket effect  comes back into the full force.  >> we joked or kind of a morbid  joke the biggest threat would  be normalization and the rest  of the market.  4% mortgage rates.  you recently upgraded to buy  wms, and talk about what makes  those attractive. >> i think for our top  homebuilding pick, i think the  growth profile is among best in  class among our homebuilders  and our coverage picked i think  valuation across the group it is very punitive, 8 1/2 times  earnings on average across the  group and you look at a company  like meritage trading around  seven times earnings and below  book value on forward estimates  to i think that is a compelling  story.  advanced drainage system is a  building product company very  much focused in terms of the  homebuilders on the front end  which is doing the horizontal  land development because before  the builders start developing.  i think that is a stop where we  are at peak fears.  something we think is a great  opportunity.  and another builder we are  pretty much bullets across the  board, we were little bit mo",

        "With the dollar, my next guest  says keep on your breath. It  depends on what exactly  president-elect trump annex --  announces next week.  we have the chief strategist of  interactive brokers to cnbc's  senior economics reporter is  here as well.  steve, there is a lot of people  going, once things get this  extreme how many more days will  rates go up?  how much higher can the dollar  get?  you say it depends on what  happens next week.  >> the momentum clearly a  stronger dollar, higher rates  right now but we will learn a  lot basically literally one  week from now when president- elect trump becomes president  trump. And we see whether these  executive orders that i think  have got the market a bit  fearful about the inflationary  impacts of tariffs and  potential immigration  restrictions. Let's see if the  market is overpricing the  negative. It would be an inverse by the rumor sell, the news, if  they turn out to be less  extreme than the market fears.  if they do, if they are  consequential, the trend can  continue  >> can you unpack a little bit  of the dynamic where we have  both high and rising bond  yields at a rising dollar.  i may throw in rising  commodities, you could argue  some things are going on.  which is driving which higher  or are they being driven by the  same news flow?  >> pretty similar.  in general if you have higher  rates in the u.s. Or higher  rates in any currency, is  generally helps appreciate that  currency.  you earn more interest by  owning that currency.  this case we have a little bit  of a kick on friday because we  learned that the economy, the  labor economy stronger than we  expected.  we should not be expecting rate  cuts anytime soon, necessarily.  and that freaked out the stock  market to a large extent.  the bond market reacted pretty  much as it might have but as  you take the rate cut  expectations off the table, the  dollar seems stronger against  other currencies where you have  central banks were more likely  to cut rate such as the bank of  england. >> it feels like the bond  market remains in the drivers  seat this year and that that's  i don't know what that portends  for stocks.  how do you explain the path we  may take through this?  >> it depends why the bond  markets, why the bond yields  are rising. If the rising to  get the economy stronger, that  is good and stocks can be  resilient under that  circumstance.  there are plenty of situations  where stocks and bonds can  diverge for well.  november 2023 was a previous  high for the bond market.  stocks did pretty well  throughout 2023.  again, the economic story is  good, they can diverge in that  way.  yields can go up in the stock  market can be okay.  if it is because of inflation  fears or because of some sort  of stagflation, all the  negatives, and if the dollar  get sort of two strong so  multinational exporters, the  ones that dominate major u.s.  indices, get their earnings  impacted, that becomes  problematic. >> how telling is it? the above  20 and sitting, does that tell  you they are creeping near the  downside?  >> vix, i like to say it is not  a fear gauge but it plays on tv  and it is not constructed as a  fear gauge and it is meant is  that markets best market  volatility over the next 30  days.  we said there is a lot of  potential news coming over the  coming days and also there is a  backwards looking element and  over the 15 sessions prior to  today, eight of them had moves  in the s&p 500 greater than 1%.  we are sailing volatility and  that is hitting priced in.  >> steve, maybe you can answer  that question for the bond  investors, is this a better or  stronger economy or because  tariffs and deficit issues and  the like?  >> i think it is all and i love  the way steve is thinking about  this.  it force my thinking which is,  why are rates higher and what  could potentially change?  i made a list and maybe we  could all add to this list.  let's start with the high  deficits that could go bigger.  this is something that  president-elect trump could do  something about.  but i think it is unlikely.  moving to the next thing,  better growth and productivity  outlooks.  the second i don't think  anybody has anything to do with  the productivity part better  growth that does look to be  part of what the market is  bracing for when it comes to  hire -- when it comes to higher  interest rates right now.  then there is inflation and  that is the fed's purview, and  we will see if the fed decides  to do more about inflation or  stays where it is at and think  it will drive down inflation  that way.  and then there is the answer to  the aspect of all of those  things and i think steve is  right to think that come  inauguration day we may get  more certainty about what least  in the months or weeks after  that, we will get a little more  certainty about what president- elect trump plans but right now  i think there is an idea that i  will sell the 10 year amid that  uncertainty rather than buy it  and you are right, i think, in  this notion that the higher  dollar i think should attract  funds to our deficit financing.  and that should be something  that helps over the long haul.  but overall my conclusion is,  there is not a whole lot really  that reverses course here,  unless president tru",

        "bring in show music please hi I'm CNBC producer Katie Kramer today on pod billionaire investor Mark lazri is doubling down on debt abroad and on women's sports but he says opportunities will surprise you if somebody said to you well all you got to do is stand there and somebody's going to slap you have you invested in it no I haven't but do you know what the ratings for that are off the chart off the chart bringing Aid and maybe some hope to victims of the LA wildfires sports gear and memorabilia company Fanatics leading the charge CEO Michael ruin anyone of our size who has a platform like we do you have a real responsibility to use your platform to make a difference plus where big Tech stands in DC who's not in the Maga 7 Netflix plus meta Mark Zuckerberg's political Evolution what he told podcaster Joe Rogan about competition content moderation and the iPhone this is almost a declaration of war he's been doing this though for the last 5 years maybe longer it's Monday January 13th 2025 squawk pod begins right now stand Becky by in 3 2 1 C please good morning everybody and welcome to squawkbox right here on CNBC we're live from the NASDAQ Market site in Time Square I'm Becky quick along with Joe kernin and Andrew Ross sorin the gang's all here we're ready for the week stocks were down on Friday after those hotter than expected jobs numbers dampened expectations for more interest rates Cuts coming from the fed this year for the year so far the Dow is down by one 1.4% it's now down about 4 and a half% from its all-time high S&P or I'm sorry the Dow is even down more than that the S&P is down 4 and a half% the Dow is down it was something that caught my attention this morning four it's off of the all-time high 7 % for the Dow off of the all-time high S&P is down 4 and a half% from the all-time high and if you're looking at the NASDAQ it's down by 3/4 of 1% for the year for the from the all-time high it's off by same thing by close to 5% uh a little over 5% if you're looking at the NASDAQ 100 treasury yields have P up picked up pretty significantly the 10e is now yielding 478 the 30-year close just below 5% on uh Friday and you can see it's sitting right at 495 right now and then you have the 2-year which is all the way up at 442 again questions about whether the fed's going to cut it all after the numbers that we saw on Friday Bitcoin is down uh about 9% from 92 supposedly support oil it's like pushing 80 again that's always helpful pretty inflation picture remember when we said that uh it just that this started so slowly with little singled digit like selloff you were saying from the beginning that you feel very uncomfortable with the and the way it starts like really quick big breaks usually that's like a bull market but when it starts slow you you you kind of write it off ah and what's it add up to now 7% 7% for the Dow it's four and a half still not that much S&P 500 but if you're talking about a 5% we haven't noted it hasn't been something that that just shakes your fear and that's the bad kind that when when it really shakes your fear it just usually comes right back up the SM or the the Russell 2000 it's more than 11% now from an all-time high so you're talking about a correction territory for some of these major averages and I think transportation's had a really rough day on Friday too transports I think this is the market having to realize that it can't have its cake and eat it too if you're going to be talking about um rate Cuts I don't even think it was strong economy it was strong economy and and it off on that but I think we've given up on rate Cuts already maybe one or two but now we're back and I that was what I was saying to leasman Pana I I I was telling him people are worried about inflation again and that's why the bonds are acting like that and a strong jobs number I said that'd be the worst thing on Friday and then it did and it was and Steve said no it's not a bad thing uh beforehand and then it happened and he says it's still not a bad thing and then even after it happened he said it's the did you read the W Street Journal piece on bonds I saw it yesterday so I don't know if it's in today's paper but I read Wall Street I read it over I read it yesterday online that's right it's online and it's such a weird it was a a kind of convoluted story trying to explain why bond yields going up may not NE necessarily be a bad thing and maybe buy into it but it was kind of convoluted it cannot be a bad thing if if if your fear is a weakening economy if that's inflation story then it's a much different don't we get inflation numbers this week don't we get a couple of them I think we do CPI and PPI I think we get something I I remember that it's you know what within a couple of weeks we're going to get something that is true we can always count on that meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg slamming rival Tech Giant apple on Friday here's what he said Friday on an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience they have used that platform to put in place a lot of rules that I think it feel arbitrary and feel like you know they haven't really invented anything great in a while it's like Steve Jobs invented the the iPhone and now they're just kind of sitting on it 20 years later Zuckerberg said Apple makes money by basically squeezing people and having a 30% tax on developers before we play some of these things we should talk a little bit more about what this means I mean this is almost a declaration of war you rarely see a big company making comments to try and draw in regulatory oversight but that's certainly what this seemed like I don't know if you guys he's been doing this though for the last five years maybe longer I think a lot he's been saying it relatively explicitly I think his argument has been both the 30% piece is something that's frustrated him immensely for on a whole level of a whole number of levels because there have been businesses that they've tried to build on top of the meta business like the metag glasses he was one of the things said that's that's the metag glasses is a separate issue where the 30% piece is about charging people and he's tried to build businesses on top of mea but then you'd have to be paying the 30% to Apple before you'd be able to build the additional business we cut off the quote that he was saying on this but he was saying like the big part of it is they're great for building the ecosystem but we basically don't want to pay to use the they don't want to pay to use the ecosystem and then the second part is the meta glasses uh which is that you know my earbuds where are my earbuds um they connect to the iPhone better than just about any other device that's made by a third party he said exactly that on and he's been very frustrated I have the metag glasses I like the metag glasses I have them too and I like them and it is a little bit more complicated to connect those glasses and it's a little more complicated to connect basically anything to an iPhone relative to the uh relative to an Apple device because they are using a different protocol now one of the points he makes about that which is so interesting is he says that they're arguing well it's a security thing yes this is what he said expli they're saying build the security into the into the service I'm sure there's elements to that which he's right about and I'm sure there's elements explicit where he said that this is just an excuse that apple is using privacy and protections he thinks it's a big scam and that's basically what he said on Joe Rogan that they're just using that as an excuse for any of these things it's just usually you don't see the big tech companies very publicly saying to The Regulators here's where you should go after them it's usually more of a a system of of Whispers of quiet behind the scenes or getting other people to be your proxy to go do it he came out and said it pretty explicitly and I you know I this is they're Frenemies right they work together on projects and and not on other things I mean I but I think that this is less of a friend ofy this is more of an enemy thing for a long time now I mean of the relationships this has probably been the most complicated over anybody I think people who are following this know this has been the most complicated Clos who's closer to the Trump Administration Zuckerberg who's trying to make some changes and make some inroads with it or Tim Cook who was very been there for since the last I was going to say I think Tim Cook is I think even Google might be oddly enough yeah but we'll see Google's close I think that that privately Sundar has had a oddly interesting relationship with Trump to the mag then as a solid uh member of the magga 7 who's not in the magga 7 Netflix Netflix is not but Netflix isn't really yeah uh Zuckerberg also described the company's relationship with the Biden Administration he said officials berated Facebook staff during requests to remove certain content basically these people from the Biden ad Administration would call up our team and like scream at them and curse and it's like these documents are it's all kind of out there did you record any of those phone calls I don't no I don't think I don't think we but but I think I want to listen I mean there are emails he said the White House asked Facebook to remove a meme that showed actor Leo DiCaprio pointing at a TV screen advertising a class action lawsuit for people who took the covid vaccine Zuckerberg said that they responded that they were not going to take down humor and satire Zuckerberg made those comments days after he announced that meta would end its factchecking program and replace it with community-driven structure that's similar to the one on X meantime uh meta platforms terminating major Dei programs those include relating uh to hiring and choosing and training suppliers meta said uh it is changing its course because of what they're saying is the changing legal and policy landscape surrounding Dei efforts in the United States as a result meta cutting its de team replacing equity and inclusion programs with programs that mitigate bias for all no matter your background it's also ending representation goals that it had created that they say set the impression that some of the decisions being made were based on gender or race separately Amazon halting some of its di programs as well spokesperson declined to detail the exact changes but said it would continue to operate organizations formed to hear worker concerns and advocate for specific groups including women black workers and military veterans and you know Robbie Starbuck the power and influence of Robbie Starbuck that's just it's just no no but he's just a messenger it was going no he's the messenger it's collapsing under its own weight but I think a lot of these companies have either heard from Robbie Starbuck sure I think they're about to hear from Robbie Starbucks but if if the problem wasn't there it wouldn't matter whether Robbie Robbie Starbucks some guy with a a man bun can't just come along and change all of corporate America if it's not ready it's it's dying under its own way collapsing under its own own weight um it's fundamentally probably not a great way to do things if it's not based on Merit we we should have learned that by now we all want to get to a certain place but you got if you do it wrong it's going to collapse te will be next coming up on squawk pod a Billionaire's pitch for sports investing why Mark lazary bought and sold the Milwaukee Bucks a pickle ball team and is now doubling down on women's leagues plus where he's finding other opportunities Europe because of what's going on in the Ukraine because of slow growth there we're seeing a lot of opportunity we're seeing that we can lend money and we can overcharge for that this is squawk po up and Andrew Q you're watching squawkbox on CNBC I'm Andrew sorin along with Joe kernin and Becky quick all right let's welcome a special guest who is here to talk sport Sports Investments the markets and much more Avenue capitals chairman and CEO Mark lazri and Mark we have so much to talk about with you this morning but I thought we'd start with sports just because you are somebody who looks at sports a little differently than most big investors do a lot of times people get into it because they're Fanboys they buy a team they love they hold on to it for forever through thick and thin and you're a little different you're not so sentimentally involved you bought the Bucks sold it at an incredible profit got into pickle ball sold out of that at a big profit too um you look at sports as an actual business and and you think people don't understand it what what do you see that others maybe Miss look I think part of it what people Miss is all sports ultimately is is how many people are watching it right so simple question like if you think of hockey half a million people watch it baseball a million basketball is a million and a half all right bull writing how many people do you think watch that um 200 million no 200,000 youan 200,000 I hope oh 200,000 yeah yeah yeah it's a million to 1.2 M okay so it's a much bigger audience really wow that shocks me I know sailing which three years ago didn't exist there's a sailing league today you've got a million eight you got more people watching sailing than you did basketball so to me part of it is you've got all these sports that people are watching so you want to sort of get into it and invest in those before they become um I would say sort of in the National conscience so you think baseball's overvalued for the number of people watching or do you think bull writing is massively undervalued for it's just undervalued I think what we're trying to do is find sports that are undervalued and invest in those um so that five years from now as they get their new media deals that's when you'll capture the upside and you've been able to do that by doing what what are the actions I know you're involved in women's sports right now you're buying a lot of women's soccer teams or making bids for them what where where do you see as the most undervalued places that have the most upside potential I think it's women's sports it really is and the simple reason for that is just as people like I don't know do you have little girls or I do right so if I would say for Joe and I our parents if I have sisters my dad never brought my sisters and I to a game it was just my dad and I right the idea that you're BR my daughter yes like it's inconceivable to you that you would not bring your daughter and that's what you're having you're having this change as more and more people are bringing their daughters and more girls want to watch other women play sports so you're seeing women's soccer you're seeing women's volleyball women's uh women's basketball those are just growing in popularity you think that women's sports will only succeed though if more women are watching those Sports so it's a generational issue or do you think you're going to UL ultimately for it to work you need men to be watching these Sports in significant numbers I ask because I think if you look at football it's actually like 6040 or maybe 7030 in terms of men to women but there's still a significant yep you need to have men watching it and I think this generation if you went when the New York Liberty ended up winning the WNBA title if you went to that you would have been shocked how many men were there yeah and that's what you're seeing you you need to have men and women watching but I would say today's generation doesn't care right the younger you are you're going to go to a woman's game you're going to go to a men's game right you know one of the reasons I really wanted to talk to you Mark was um what we're watching in college sports right now the name image and likeness money has changed the game entirely we're we're talking about things that it's hard to say that these are still going to be student athletes focus on the athlete part not so much on the student part and I I think you see an opportunity here and I'm trying to figure out what I think of that opportunity you've said that you'd be looking at some of these college teams that the colleges are going to sell them or at least majority stakes in them that is hard enough for me to get my head around how how does it work why does it work and how is it going to change things they don't have a choice you know and the simple reason they don't is kids are getting paid so whereas for me growing up the dream was to go play a duke or go play a Kentucky or UCLA today if you're a kid if you're getting paid money from University of Louisville and that's more that you're getting from duke you're going to go there and so the cost of that is going up and the problem for universities is you need that money to attract those students and the only way you're going to get that money is is either alumni are going to pay are going to give you more but the problem with that is it's no longer a tax deduction so if you I don't know where you went but if you ruers okay so ruers for ruers to get people to go you've got to donate but if you donate to University it's 100% tax deduction if you donate to the athletic department it's not so therefore you're going to find it's going to get more and more expensive and what you're going end up doing is selling these businesses not 100% but you'll sell 50% of that so that you can keep attracting students and as you attract students it's great for the institution but if you see an opportunity there it's because you think more can be done more profit can be generated from this isn't the university giving up on that profit if they're selling out on it early at a lower at a lower amount 100% no universities understand that but universities need the capital because through the capital more people are going to come to the games and as more people come to the games more people go to the university so they understand that and it's either alumni going to give you that money or it's going to be people like us but you think it's an important flywheel that they don't have more students who are attracted to the university if they don't build these big programs they don't have a choice and it's sad because I think college sports is getting dominated by you know Ohio Michigan and um all of those and you're going to have like for ruers it's going to be hard yeah so ruers needs to attract um more students who are going to come and the way they're going to do that is those students are going to get paid and and the opportunity for you and the places that you're doing this can you talk about any of the places that you're actually working on a bid right now yeah I mean we're talking to a number of universities and for us if you say University is making a 100 million from that we'll buy that for we'll buy half of it and we'll end up paying like around 12 times so University is going to get about $600 million and that helps them over the next five years to 10 years to compete and to build and grow how much do you think of all of this as a venture capital style approach versus a private Equity style approach I think it's very much private Equity I don't think you don't think that there is going to be a bunch of home home runs in here and a bunch of bankruptcies when this is all over no because you're investing in programs that exist oh no on the college sports side I'm just saying on I'm saying broadly speaking you got the college piece here you got women's sports you got sailing got sailing you got all sorts of things in here and I'm just sort of wondering do you say to yourself you know what I may strike out uh a whole bunch of times here but I think that there's so many you know not so many but even a couple of massive winners in here that it's all going to sort of make it you know come out wash in a good way no I think it's very much private equity and the reason for that is I have the cheat code like how would you like when you were in high school and you already knew the answers to the test you'd love that right you think you got the answers well I do and I'll tell you why it's actually really simple after it ends up being on TV we now know what the ratings are so why did I invest in bull riding because I saw that ratings every year for three years went up I'm not investing in things where ratings are going down and people aren't watching I'm only doing it after I see that people are doing it so the fact that you've got the the ratings every day after something plays that's what you've had in women's Sports women's sports ratings have grown astronomical so I'm not really taking any chances that's the difference like I'll give you an example and I I got in trouble for it um there's a new league the slapping League yep I know the league yeah and for for a hot minute um David zazo I think was um broadcasting some of it I don't think he is right now right but that League started out of nowhere and if somebody said to you well all you got to do is stand there and somebody's going to slap you right right I was tell have you invested in it no I haven't okay but do you know what the ratings for that are off off the charts yes and that's my it's mesmerizing I know but it shouldn't be it's yes but we know the answer right right and that's that's why it's not Venture the fact that power slap has taken the United States by storm is phenomenal but you and I would have said that makes no sense yet Americans are watching no no it it makes a lot of sense it's just then the question of what do you do about that whether you should allow it to continue Mark let's talk to you about the broader markets you are somebody who's always looked for distress that U or distress deals and found really great opportunities are you seeing any of those opportunities right now are you holding dry PW hoping for some opportunities to step up you have more opportunities outside the US you know in the US today there's a lot of liquidity I would say everybody is positive of what's happening and thinks that over the course of next year um you're going to have a market that's going to be going up Europe because of what's going on in the Ukraine because of slow growth um there we're we're seeing a lot of opportunity we're seeing that we can lend money and we can overcharge for that here in the United States it's just much harder for that that's was going to be my question how much of you are you playing around with the sports stuff and how much are you still doing this that this is what you do and I was going to ask whether how's lickstein looking for their crappy distressed debt pretty good if you uh or take your pick that's that's what you do is it and that's continuing how much of of your business is still that and how much is is this other stuff you're I think you're kind of dabbling in this other did you buy the PBR stuff are you dealing with Ari yes I am I am dealing with Ari you are I be getting a cut of all these things I get nothing I pay him why I don't I don't understand so yeah because he's PBR right he's PBR so 90% of what we do is our Core Business which is lending and 9% yeah and 10% is on the sports side that's the sports side is just far more interesting it's high profile you have big investors like a Steph Curry and without Wes V without Wes you wouldn't be doing any of this I don't think Wes Edens yeah but we're not Partners anymore I know but he talked you into that I he I just know the story that it was it was going to be too much and yes he did slapped you and he said stop whining and and get in here next thing you know you you got 10 times your money or something that's there was about 10 times more money so where in Europe where I'm sorry where Europe are the opportunities right now like oh I it's all northern Europe right now you don't want to be in southern Europe because the legal systems worse but for us it's northern Europe we're investing quite a bit in the UK we're investing quite a bit in Ireland um we're just seeing that you can lend Capital um we're lending money I would say at liore plus 8 lior plus 10 before we let you go Celtics are for sale yes would you buy the C at a $6 billion price tag if that's where it ultimately lands it's the Buy Low I think that's high yeah I the main reason it's high where do you think it ends then you think it's not going to go for six five and a half no I don't it should be somewhere around o over five the problem is you don't own the arena okay right I think if they own the arena then you would see them trading above six but since they don't you're just buying the team okay as a as a longtime Knicks fan do you think that the Dolan char Dolan will now uh Chuck will will sell I don't think he'll ever sell his father passed away there's always been a lot of speculation about whether the Knicks would would go up for sale I think he loves owning the team I think the team is doing well um they beat the bock how much you think the Nicks are worth you know I think the Knicks are worth a minimum of 7 T and all you would need is another person to show up and you could get involved in a bidding war but the Knicks could go for a hefty preium just like the Lakers could right mainly because in those two cities you've got a number of people who'd want to own that you would want to own it totally so put together Syndicate I'm with you okay I'll call you mark let's go back to what we're watching with interest rates here in the United States and how that plays in we're watching interest rates pick up and you can have a lot of different reasons for why people would say that the 10 years of 477 today you think it's inflation um do you think it's how much the government is spending and investors taking more note of that saying you're going to have to pay me more to do this do you think it's a sign of troubling times to come do you think it will present more opportunities for you from a distress debt perspective down the road I think it's very much that the bond markets look at and say there's going to be more and more money that's going to be borrowed and you and I both know as you're borrowing more money um that's just not good like in times of Positive Growth you should be paying down debt you shouldn't be borrowing more money and you know then if you end up reducing taxes um that's just going to increase the deficit so I think it's good news for equities because there's going to be more money available but it's bad news for bonds and it's bad news for interest rates because the cost of capital is going to keep on getting more expensive as that cost keeps going up for companies they're going to pay more and that's going to be benefit icial for people like me because you can then offer to pay them money to to let them borrow money right and I can lend at higher rates are you uh we haven't got much time are you glad you sold SE Island no cuz it's worth 10 times as much as you probably sold it for right well it's worth more but um it was a unique asset it's still a unique asset yeah and is there a better place do you think no I think you just I I think one of the things I've learned is try not to sell you cets I'm just I'm just throwing throwing him I I hear from Stylin when I mess the mayor he thinks he's a mayor of it's the greatest place in the world is it not I don't think anything's it's gorgeous are you glad you sold the Bucks and Fred r i I'm sad I sold the box I I loved owning it I think it was fun I think it's a great Club to be in um it was just a big chunk of my net worth yeah so what more did you need to accomplish there I mean you can't how many Nets once you win a championship how many Nets you need to cut down right um how many water how many boats can you water ski behind Gordon you can water ski behind a lot that's right Mark want to thank you very much for joining us we always love talking you and we hope come back how many Yachts how many Yachts not boats I misquoted uh the great GG next on squawk pod the massive Financial impact of the California fires is just beginning to be be understood our Contessa Brewer is in Pacific Palisades the economic impact estimates of 135 billion to 150 billion insured losses of more than 22 billion the emotional impact is harder to measure fanatic CEO Michael Rubin joins us on the quickly developing work of Los Angeles's pro sports teams to bring a little relief to Wildfire victims you've been through such a tragedy now if you've lost your house what can we try to do to show you that there's hope and get on the other side of this Sports brings communities together you're listening to squawk pod from CNBC here's Joe kernin developing story in the California wildfires Governor Gavin Newsome says this could be the costliest uh natural disaster in us uh history contesta Brewer joins us now from the Pacific Palisades area hey Contessa hey good morning Joe yeah wildfires are still burning and strong wind forecast for this week neighborhoods I watch them they're decimated lives livelihoods homes schools businesses lost and yet of course the work of recovery already begins Gavin Newsome's emergency declaration this weekend clears the way now for rebuilding he's ordered state agencies to streamline the permitting process the economic impact estimates of 135 billion to 150 billion being forecast by ACU weather insured losses of more than 22 billion that's according to Aon that's a new estimate over the weekend these are very early though and largely this is a residential story as opposed to a commercial property insurance story although it's not in insignificant for commercial either in Pacific Palisades where I am insurance coverage from the fair plan California's Last Resort insurer plays a predominant role claim payouts are capped here at $3 million so of course that leaves many homeowners underinsured a highly placed Insurance executive tells me that's likely a theme even where homeowners had coverage through brand name insurers because materials inflation construction materials up 37.3% over the Last 5 Years construction labor up 35% far higher than regular inflation homeowners may not have kept pace with their coverage meaning they may have coverage for say a $2 million replacement value where now it maybe would cost closer to 3 million also I'm told where homeowners have paid off their mortgages or never had one they may have opted out of the insurance coverage altogether given how high the price of insurance is and when it comes time to rebuild already Brokers are warning me developers of multi-unit properties May opt to take the insurance payout you know just sell the land and run because of the prohibitive cost of insurance it just makes developing land unprofitable President Biden has of course promised 100% federal assistance to cover all of California's fire management and debris removal cost for 100 days uh 180 days rather that's up from the typical 75% this is a multi-property unit here 16 units with amazing views of the Pacific Ocean completely gone at this point uh and and this creates all of it a short-term housing crunch maybe a crisis a top executive told me the insurance company he works for is already securing rentals of houses for their clients and two part of the big cost of this is that this is now a toxic waste site because of the flame retardant and the fire itself so that adds to the cost of demolition at this point something that will'll have to keep our eye on guys it's very concerning because the winds are kicking up again uh contestant I'm just wondering whether this could be replicated you you know who ran against Karen bass Rick Caruso who had previously been the commissioner for for uh the the LA Department of uh of Water and Power he's a billionaire developer and he he he employed private firefighters in water storage tanks and saved a his uh one of his properties a Pacific Palisades Mall everything around him is gone and and he was able to sa that I wonder if that could be replicated or whether I mean this is ahead of us now uh Monday Tuesday Wednesday the winds could kick up against again the gust of 50 or 70 mph um he's been very critical by the way of Karen bass and and U and government officials for you know uh fire preparedness insufficient water storage um everything uh in terms of forest you know what should have been done with Forest management but management right now that they're ready or could they be ready to do something like this to to save as much as possible from for what could be another uh another onslaught it's already it's already happening Joe while the fires were burning even last week there were neighborhoods that were banding together to say hey should we hire our own folks to go out and and spray fire retardant and then other neighbors said yeah but you know do we want to have this toxic chemical in our Lawns and on our homes if it's not going to burn so so that's already happening the second thing is take chub for instance which sells Insurance in the excess and surplus line so this is outside of the regulated Insurance Market they can charge what they think the risk costs and do and then and it's not subject to approval by the state insurance commissioner chub actually contracts with these private companies that go out and they'll you know tape up your vents and spray down your foam on your roof that's part of this high-end service that you get when you contract with chub so it's not just Rick Caruso a lot of people would have gotten this through their insurance company and you know know and and it helps protect your house the other thing that's going to be in focus in rebuilding is you know I I had just done a story on New Year's Eve about the mitigation available with with building materials and the way that when you build a house to withstand fire it can withstand a lot more a blowing Ember doesn't necessarily ignite that house then and so there will be a lot of focus even if they streamline it can you build back better and more resistant right like peppernut and I know lot expensive the the moat and but just water storage tanks I'm not even talking about the flame retardant stuff but but just water I mean they didn't have they didn't have water if you had a pump and a sprinkler system and your pool you could have done it and they they I've seen videos where people said the idea you know that the the palisad reservoir was empty uh contest that thank you Fanatics in 17 Los Angeles sports team there's are 17 teams have uh partnered to sell La strong uh t-shirts of proceeds of which will support the Red Cross and the LA fire department Foundation joining us now with more on the effort Michael Rubin CEO uh of Fanatics and I commend you once again um for what you're doing here Michael it's not over uh and I'm wondering any anything we can do now in anticipation of of the Winds kicking up again uh this week no look we're just getting started I mean I think we feel like anyone of our size and kind of who has a platform like we do you have a real responsibility to use your platform to make a difference and I think we demonstrated that during Co when we did the big all and challenge I think it was one of the biggest digital fundraisers Ever we' Raised 60 million bucks we made masks for the first time before anyone was thinking about it cutting up baseball facks and uniforms turning them into into masks and I think the great thing is to watch everyone coming together we actually last week started saying okay what can we do and then I got a phone call from Lon Rosen from the LA Dodgers said hey most of the LA teams just got together and said we've got to do things what can we do hey could you get fnatic to make a collection of apparel could they donate all the profits could you get the leagues and teams to donate all the profits that was like the easiest yes I got the phone call at 4:00 on Thursday and by that night the whole thing was organized and our entire organization rallied together and we launched it the next day um but we don't say okay we're done now by the way it's going to be a big big program there's already I think 30,000 individuals have bought around the world have bought La strong merchandise which shows people not just in Los Angeles but people in New York people in you've already spun the stuff up I mean we're we got it right here already it got delivered to me when I got here this morning yeah why did you pick the Trojans well my daughter goes to USC we got yeah we got to support USC you got Bruins um yeah we've got yeah we've got every I mean if you're an LA sports team whether you came up front or you saw this launch you got into it it's really about everyone coming together but the amazing thing is we're not like okay we're done that's us just getting started later this week um and our teams didn't want me to say this but you know I'll announce it here we're working to give away about $3 million of merchandise later this week early next week in Los Angeles to people that have lost their houses were actually looking for things that would be very emotional to them you know LA's had a lot of championships in The Last 5 Years they' Dodgers won the World Series twice um the Rams have won the champ you know run the Super Bowl thanks for that Lakers um LFC and the Galaxy both won the cup so we're looking for all that Championship merchandise because if your house burnt down you know that may be something was very emotional hey I had the championship shirt from when when we won um so we're going to get $3 million of merchandise together and just give it away later this week um one of the things has been heartbreaking but really interesting is the amount of individuals who have reached out to our company who reached out to me said you know my house burnt down but the only thing that really matters is this piece of memorabilia that I lost um somebody called me actually an investor of mine called me on Tuesdays the first person um and said you know my sister's house burnt down it was a very expensive house we don't care about the house she had a couple things from Kobe and those were her most important prize possessions can you get me something to help we place that we right away found those things so you know we've seen so many individual stories where I think based on the relationship we have with players with the teams we can create truly a dreamy um experience for individuals one by one that can't change the horrible situation of them losing their house but maybe can bring some happiness to them and I think it really is our responsibility to do everything we can and so it's great that we launched La strong with 17 teams it's great that over 30,000 people have participated around the world it's great that we're going to give away $3 million a product later this week but we're just getting started we're going to do everything we can and the RO Heroes here it's not us the heroes here are the firefighters all these people coming together I mean I look what they're going through it's insane and we have so many employees that are affected by this as well I mean the rebuild is going to take so long and be so demanding of of time and resources I guess you're just getting started but those are funds that can really go towards the rebuilding too yeah and I think our desire here would be to be one of the people who created the most funds for this and did the most in the city this is one that look there are disasters that happen often within a year but the ones that are really big and hit hard and this is very personal we have a thousand employees in Los in La yeah we have multiple employees that have lost their homes and I have so many friends that are you know have lost their homes on top of our employees have lost home so it just feels like your family has been so affected here let me ask you you have a home out there as well I do it's okay yeah is is your sense I mean what do you mean beyond the human toll which is obviously the the thing we're all focused on what do you think the economic impact on La is going to be obviously the Olympics are coming up by the way in 28 there's debates about whether the city's going to be able to actually rebuild by then there's World Cup there's Super Bowl I there's a lot of sports not just in the city already but coming to the city and here we have this this this tragedy in front of us yeah look I think the I don't know the exact numbers but I think this tragedy is of Epic Proportion I saw an estimate three or four days ago that said it already been $50 billion in damage and that was like three or four days ago um I think the Market's going to have to go through a lot of Correction I mean look La is one of the most amazing cities in the world I love this city you know I spend a lot of time there because a very it's one of the hubs of the sports and entertainment worlds but if you think about today it's very hard to get insurance right I don't have my my house I have an expensive house I have no Wildfire Insurance because you can't get Wildfire Insurance in Los Angeles um now I don't worry about my to me you know people ask me other the time is your house okay I'm like I'm not worried about my house I'm worried about all the other people that lost their houses you see people that owned a house for 30 40 years and now you know they can't afford to rebuild it they didn't have Wildfire Insurance how do you fix that problem I mean you're well I look I I think um government needs to act more like a business in this situation and and look this is complicated like you know there's like I you guys know I don't get involved in politics but I think here you need to go and say okay we have a real problem you're going to have you know many tens of billions maybe even could it reach a hundred billion dollar in in damage or plus you know you've got all these people have lost their houses how do we help them to rebuild the houses on a costeffective basis what happens if they didn't have insurance how do we not have people take advantage of them so I think there's going to be a lot of entrepreneurial business leadership that's needed I think you need anyone that can make a big difference that's your responsibility you run a big company you can help in a big way you know you're an insurance company I know this is a really difficult situation for you because La is a bad Market to insure but how can you help make a difference that's why for us we keep saying what are all the things we can do and I can tell you from the show I'll see reach outs and we'll get a good idea of someone hey we didn't think about that we should do that so I think I would say the biggest thing that a lot of people that watch this show can do you know these are some of the most powerful people in the world you have a big platform use that platform to make a difference that's why we want to do so many different things so when I see you guys in a month or two because I know you guys want to talk about Fanatics later we talk about here are all the things we did in La make that Insurance what are you suggesting insurance companies should do because they've left if it's not subsidized you got to let let them charge what they need to charge and it's going to be expensive and by the way if you can't get insurance I'm not sure that you can get then get a mortgage going for it right and so I think the Market's going to have to go through a reset to be more logical you can't force an insurance company to lose money that doesn't work okay the most obvious thing that any business person would say it's what any of us would say is is hey if we were running this wildfires are not a one-time thing in the Los Angeles area if they're not a onetime thing how do you now get prepared to make sure that the next time this happens that the the ability to deal with this is so much more effective but that sounds like things the government needs to do not just and I think the government needs to be more entrepreneurial because look I I you know again I you know I don't get into politics I like a lot of these guys personally it's politics not my thing if this were me I'd be in a war room with the smartest people could say okay this keeps happening it's going to keep happening how do we prepare ourselves differently so the next time happen and don't you this was just abysmal that they shot themselves in the foot preparedness was just certainly they weren't prepared for what a lot of people said was obvious and to me exactly um the biggest way I think you fix this long term isn't about how you force insurance companies or Banks or what to do I think it's to eliminate the problem going forward and I think the cost of eliminating the problem going forward is probably measured in hundreds of millions not billions it's say if you want to be prepared for this like you see all these things on social media about ideas people have there's a lot of good ideas we need to be entrepreneurial to solve the problem going people want to buy some T-shirts what they do they go to uh they go to any of their team stores to the LA Dodger store they go to fanatics.com can you do anything with the gambling sites that raise raise money or we keep we keep I love that everything with you always comes back to well you the first thing you said to me is am I using the fin yeah you told me no the one thing that's clear I'm I'm fully committed to today is about making to all the things we can do for a lot a different company a lot of different ways to do this but and and great for us the thing that we I will tell you one of the biggest ways to get your team we have 22,000 employees excited when you say hey there's a real drill to do things really quickly for something like this people love to make an impact when I was calling making people crazy during the all-in challenge and we raised $60 million um that we got directly to uh food insecurity our team they just they were so proud and I think people are excited about this they're excited about the power giveaway later this week they're excited about finding individual stories where they can change someone's life you know we just saw a story about I don't want to ruin it because we haven't done yet but a kid who the best prized thing they had in their house was a ball from one of their favorite players and you know maybe we can get that player and get them to go show up with that person's house and you know and so you know you've been through such a tragedy now if you've lost your house what can we try you to show you that there's hope and get on the other side of this and that's what and look Sports brings communities together and we sit in the middle of that and that is our responsibility and this is one of the you watch the the tragedy is heartbreaking one of the funnest things is if we can really help make a difference thank you for thek for coming short notice getting you on good good to good to have you on thanks thanks for coming in Michael that is squawk pod for today as we start another week squawk pod is hosted by Joe kernin Becky quick and Andrew Ross sorin tune in weekday

        "joining us this morning Edison International CEO Pedro pisaro Pedro appreciate the time I know this is a very difficult week I hope you won't mind me asking just because the stock is on the Move whether or not there are investigations as to whether a power line was a potential cause well thanks for having me and let me just start by saying that this is heartbreaking in our community my wife and I have lived in Pasadena which is one of the impacted areas for almost 37 years so this is home and a big thank you to all the firefighters in first respon bonders and our workers helping out out there to answer your question yes there is interest and we filed two incident reports now one was for the Hearst fire which is now close to contained no structures uh impact it we know we had damage drawer lines there but the reported start of the fire the time of that start was 1 minute before we saw any sort of impact uh in terms of electrical anomalies in our system so I really don't know whether the damage happened before the fire started or after the fire started the fire that is in the most focus is Eaton and that's the one that's a much larger fire in the Pasadena aladen area now in that fire we fil an incident report uh that we put that out because we had gotten interest from attorneys asking us to preserve evidence because there was media attention but at the time that we filed that and still now U as we do our Telemetry our monitoring of the system we do not see any electrical anomalies and those are it's pretty typical you see those when you have a spark coming from equipment now there may be some other mechanism here and unfortunately we have not been able to get up close to the lines yet firefighters are doing their hard work and we have not been able to get close to those Towers uh but as soon as we're able to do that we'll investigate further and certainly be transparent with our public if we know more at some point but fair to say at this stage uh you haven't ruled anything out and there's probably very little visibility on a timeline for further Discovery yes uh it it can take a while and so yes it's uncertain what the timeline would be U we also need to ground this though in the framework that we have in California for Wildfire mitigation right we've done a lot of work as a state and the state uh legislature the governor The Regulators done tremendous work since the catastrophic fires of 2017 and 18 so we have a structure here where we have Wildfire mitigation plans that keep utilities accountable they spell out the wor that we're supposed to do and are doing uh to help prevent fires there's the work that firefighters have done the state has uh doubled the resources available for firefighting but they also recognize that especially with extreme weather uh the risk will never be zero and for those uh occasions when that risk materializes there's a wildfire liability fund that was set up $21 billion fund that is there to help uh people impacted by the fire along with a liability cap for investor own utilities like Southern California Edison now Carl that liability cap today is 3.9 billion do for any events happening over a three-year period yet our market cap has decreased by $9 billion since the start of the fires so I want to make sure that investors understand the framework that we have in California which is really a model for other states that are also experiencing Wildfire risk",

        "Biotech a player.  let's get more with our  evangelical peoples, -- angelica .  >> good morning, carl.  thank you so much for being  here, emma.   you are acquiring a --  >> thank you very much,  angelica.  it's great to be here.  it's wonderful to kickoff the  year with this good news at the  time of real momentum for gsk.   in 2024, we have, at the  beginning of the year, we were  able to upgrade our medium and  long-term outlets and a big  part of that is the real  momentum in our specialty  business.  we have made a conscious  decision to invest the back in  oncology.  that business was doubled  already up until the reported  results last year and this  year, we are really looking  forward to hopefully the  approval of multiple myeloma,  really important new drug with  various significant results in  terms of overall survival for  cancer sufferers with multiple  myeloma and this announcement  today is another ad in our  oncology portfolio, adding to  the assets that we have in g.i.  cancers.  we hope it's going to be able  to be a best in class solution  for those living with the g.i.  stromal tumor cancer.  they really data is showing  that the 90% of sufferers --  this potentially could have  broader coverage to address  that and be more tolerable.  so a great thing to add to that  portfolio at a time when gs k  has come back and cancer is  very firmly on track.  and obviously, we all know that  a cancer diagnosisis a  difficult one for the one in  five of us has to face that  personally.  i'm sure that everybody here on  your set knows or loves someone  who is facing that.  there's still so much unmet  need here in this disease and  we really are determined that  gsk will bring new, needed  solutions, not least in this  country roots remains the best  country in the world to bring  new innovation.  >> a big piece of your  portfolio is vaccines and they  have been in the news a lot.  he shared a stat that there is   to again five infants around  the world actually get the  vaccine.  we are hearing a lot about this  in the u.s. With -- how do you  feel about that and what his  presence might mean for  vaccines and your business?  >> well the first thing to say  is our purpose at gsk is  defined as getting ahead of  disease together and  that is  also what making america  healthy is, keeping america  healthy and it's great to hear  the new administration talking  about prevention of disease.  part of that can be vaccines  and, let's face it.  there is no greater  intervention in public health  than vaccination.  i think the cdc said in the  last 30 years, 500 million  childhood illnesses have been  prevented through vaccination.  more than 1 million childhood  deaths have been prevented and  that is something that parents  now don't have to, you know,  both moms.  we will have to worry so much  about our children and measles  or polio or diseases that have  long since been dealt with.  we at gsk really  welcome a  trance.  dialogue about vaccination.  the efficacy nation is the  efficacy. It appears have  questions, let's answer them.  getting ahead of disease  together is about  collaboration.  we look forward to discussing  that but remember, the biggest  business is also in specialty  medicine.  that's where we are seeing  double digit growth in hiv and  oncology.  and you know",

THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SWEENEY  AND ZUCKERBERG HAVE BEEN  ALIGNED ON SO IT'S INTERESTING  FOR HIM TO COME OUT AND SLAM  ALL OF BIG TECH IN THE WAKE OF  THIS INTERVIEW.  MEANWHILE, HIS COMMENTS  SLAMMING APPLE FOR NOT  INVENTING ANYTHING NEW SINCE  THE iPHONE, THAT HAD USERS  CALLING HIM OUT FOR BUYING  INSTAGRAM AND WHAT'S APP AND  MAKING SNAPPY COPIES OF TWITTER.

YOU JUST SWITCH TO THE WINNING  SIDE.  AND INDEED, GUYS, THERE HAVE  ANOTHER TECH LEADERS THAT HAVE  BEEN FAR MORE OUTSPOKEN ON  THESE SORT OF MAGA IDEALS LONG  BEFORE IT WAS TRENDY OR  CONVENIENT.  A FEW NAMES THAT COME TO  MIND,  -- PALMER LUCKY AND ALEX KARP.  THESE ARE PERHAPS NOT LOST ON  THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HIMSELF.  AT A PRESS CONFERENCE LAST  WEEK, TRUMP WAS ASKED WHETHER  THE POLICY CHANGES ARE A DIRECT  RESPONSE TO THE THREAT THAT HE  HAS MADE AGAINST ZUCKERBERG.  HE REPLIED, PROBABLY.  BUT TRUMP HAS SAID THAT  FACEBOOK HAS COME A LONG WAY  AND HE CALLED HIM IMPRESSIVE.  SO I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS  UNCLEAR RIGHT NOW BUT NO DOUBT,  THE REST O",

        "Course, behind chatgpt is out  with new recommendations for the incoming trump administration  around ai policy. Kate rooney joins us. She has the details. >> david, good morning. So this is a policy blueprint  from openai a week before the  trump administration takes  office. It includes recommendations for  lawmakers, and the gist of it is geopolitics, arguing the u.s.  needs to invest in ai  infrastructure to beat china. Openai's head of policy says  there's an estimated $175  billion from global funds ready  to invest today. They say if the u.s. Doesn't  attract that cash it will flow  to china-backed projects,  strengthening the ccp's global  influence. Here is what i was told this  morning. >> there are two countries in  the world that can actually  build ai and specifically ai  infrastructure at scale, the  u.s. And china. And so for the u.s., the  question is do we want to make  sure we're attracting that money to the u.s. As opposed to seeing it go potentially to china. So huge economic opportunity  because of what this can do in  terms of the economic  development in different parts  of the country, but also huge  national security implications. >> he calls it a race that the  u.s. Absolutely has to win, says chips data and energy as well as tant are going to be key in  winning. There is a line in the blueprint about models being trained with  neutral political values, trying to counter the woke ai  criticism. I also asked him about whether  elon musk has been a rival of  openai, and mark zuckerberg, who has gotten more outspoken would  support the effort. He said anyone who wants to see  the u.s. Win over china and  wants democratic ai to win over  authoritarians would support  something like this. I asked him quickly about mark  zuckerberg's more outspoken  stance lately, especially on joe rogan over the weekend.  >> in silicon valley there is,  you know, an interest and desire for folks to be authentically  themselves. I think that authentic quality  comes out over the long term and it's not only what people say,  but it is what they do. And, you know, i turn it back a  little bit to how we're thinking about things. The blueprint speaks to how we  are thinking about the world and ultimately what we want to do to help move the world forward. >> we did also learn tha",

        "Require a whole lot of new  thinking, everything from  construction technology to  permits. Bill baldwin is the ceo and  joins us this morning. Appreciate you taking some time  at a very difficult week. Good to see you. >> thanks for having me. I want to start with just my  heart is going out to everybody  who has been involved in this. I've been involved in this for  decades and have been involved  in rebuilding from fires before. What we're seeing is  unprecedented. It's heartbreaking.  >> i think the whole country has realized that quickly. Bearing in mind that the top  priority is caring for the  people and families of l.a., do  you think eventually we're going to graduate to a rebuilding  mind-set, and if so, how is that going to look or sound  different? >> i think they will. I think these communities will  come back stronger than ever. On top of all the grief and  loss, they have to brace for  some timing. It will take a while between  clearing land and getting  permits and drawing plans and  getting the estimates done  before we can get them back on  their feet. But that timing, actually, will  help from a building point of  view because that timing for the houses with the losses will  allow the building arts  industry, the architects,  buildings, engineers to gear up  and brace up to help these  people. I know everybody in my industry  is now trying to figure out how  do we best help. It will be a regional thing, it  will not just be local.  >> right. We mentioned construction  technology. Is that a big piece of this, how buildings are going to look and  be built differently, beyond the buffer zones and policies of the past? >> absolutely. When you look at, especially in  the eaton fire and altadena, a  lot of these homes that  contributed to the dominoing  from what was a forest fire into an urban fire, these are 60, 80, 100-year-old homes and they were vulnerable. Now everything is going to be  built to more modern fire  standards. Again, that in terms of fire  resistant materials,  landscaping, buffer zones around the house. These houses were significantly  better than what we've seen here and will be much more resistant  and it will make them insurable, which is a huge issue in  california. Yeah, the building technologies  will weigh in large and i think  it will be a huge part of  rehabilitating these  rehabilitating these  communities.  >> another is the timing. Typically doesn't california  have onerous permitting and  regulatory statutes when it  comes to development? i know governor newsom suspended some on the environmental acts,  for instance, in terms of  rebuilding. But what else, any sort of  indication on how long this will take? >> i think that's going to be  the start. They're going to have to figure  out how to move more quickly  through other aspects of the  building permit process. But, again, there's going to be  some time involved. Given the loss that's gone on  here, i hate to say this to the  homeowners, but there will be  some timing involved and there's going to be a lot of people  coming to the table. I think the fact that we have  total loss here and we have time involved, it's going to help us  gear up for it. But, yeah, there's going to be  some time. People are going to have to have some patience with this.  >> bill, there is a question  from some as to whether there  should be rebuilding in some of  these areas at all given the  changes in the environment, the  climate change, the expectation  for continued periods of great  drought and what that will mean  for fire risk. How do you see it? >> yeah, and i think everything  is an educational process, just  like earthquakes in the past,  we've learned from them and  adjusted how we build. This is an unprecedented fire. Santa ana is common here, but  this was 100 mile-an-hour winds. There may be certain sites that  are going to be far more  challenging to rebuild and we'll have to take that in",

        "This is primed for increased  engagement and produced a slew  of changes to its own content  moderation policies. Joining us is the former fcc  chair, now a partner at  searchlight capital. Nice to have you here.  >> good to be with you.  >> we were dealing with the ban  of tiktok toward the end of your first -- well, when you were  chair and the end of the last  trump administration. Where do you stand on it this  time? do you think it's appropriate? >> well, i think the supreme  court is weighing some of the  same national security  considerations and free speech  considerations that animated  congress in the first place to  pass the law. That law, as you know, was  itself predicated on president  trump's august 2020 executive  order in which he said this was  a national emergency, that this  issue deserved attention. And so i think we saw the  supreme court, really serious  consideration of the national  security considerations involved in bytedance, a chinese-owned  corporation, potentially  controlling some of the data of  u.s. Users of tiktok.  >> i mean, obviously, they were  weighing the free speech  implications. Many who listened to the  arguments believe they were  coming down more in favor of the national security  considerations. We'll have to wait and see. Meanwhile, your former boss,  president-elect trump is not in  favor of the ban. I'm sort of curious as to  whether you have a playbook on  how it will play out given,  obviously, the legislation has  already been passed.  >> it will be interesting to see what the supreme court does. Obviously they're weighing those issues i discussed. In the oral argument, if you  listened, they also opened the  door to procedural complexities. For example, could the supreme  court issue an administrative  stay to allow the next  administration to take some  action to facilitate a  divestiture. Could the next administration  simply decide not to enforce the law. These are the types of things  the supreme court opened the  door to. And interestingly, the solicitor general said she was not  necessarily opposed to an  administrative stay or the next  administration having a chance  to issue its own extension of  the divestiture deadline. We'll see what happens, the next week is going to be very fraught both in the judicial branch and  next executive branch. >> does the president have a  mechanism to intervene  otherwise? >> the president-elect did  submit a brief in this  particular case, weighing in on  neither particular side. Once he takes office, he might  as the supreme court seemed to  hint, have the opportunity to  extend the deadline for  divestiture. That's one of the things -- it  wasn't fleshed out in the oral  argument.  >> what about these groups that  want to buy tiktok here,  american investors? like the latest is kevin o'leary from shark tank. He's been at mar-a-lago. Does that help the chances or is that ultimately just in the  chinese decisionmakers' hands? >> ultimately it's in the  chinese decisionmakers it's  hands, and they've said we would not divest to any buyer,  wonderful or not. It's going to be a question of  whether or not the chinese  government allows a divestiture. The law does give the president, either the current president or  the president-elect, the ability to extend by 90 days the  divestiture deadline if, indeed, those discussions are going to  be likely to be fruitful. We'll see if a buyer emerges in  the next week who is credible.  >> given the complexities and  uncertainties, how do you think  about the rivals of tiktok and  how they're planning for a range of outcomes? >> it's interesting, what you  saw in other places where tiktok has been, banned or limited, for example, in india where tiktok  was banned, there's been a  massive shift to other  platforms, youtube and invoices. I would imagine there might be a similar dynamic here if, indeed, tiktok is no longer available on u.s. Communications platforms. I think by and large, the  u.s.-based social media  companies are relatively immune  from some of the same  considerations that animated the law here. So i don't think they're in  direct danger of being regulated the same way.  >> brendan carr is going to be  taking the job you once had  soon. What are your expectations in  terms of the fcc and how it will differ from that under the biden administration? >> i think brendan carr is going to be a superb chairman. I worked very closely with him  for many years and i know that  he has both deep expertise in  all of the issues, as well as a  determination to work hard to  advance the ball in terms of  american innovation and  investment. And so i would expect him to  clear out a lot of the  regulatory underbrush that has  accumulated over the last four  years. For example, there's bee",

        "Writing that after two down  years, eps is set to grow again. Joining us with expectations of  earnings, ceo of kbo, a stifel  company. What do you expect? >> good morning. Like you said, we've just had  two years of down earnings per  share, and we think the banking  industry is turning the corner  on a variety of fronts. One is we think we're embarking  on a two-year growth cycle. The biggest banks we think are  going to grow earnings 15% this  year, so that's because the  yield curve is no longer  inverted and it's because we're  getting a little bit more loan  growth. We also think that there's a  positive coming on the side of  regulation, which could have a  material impact on the biggest  banks and on other banks. And having just less intensity  like we've had it, we think  could be a bullish case for the  banks. So many of the banks still trade at a discount to the overall  market, right after the election the stocks went up 11% the first day. They've given all of that back. We know there's a lot of concern right now about higher for  longer in rates, and that is  causing us to maybe narrow our  stock selection some as we go  into this earnings reporting  season.  >> so how do you think about  winners and losers now that we  have seen this big rate move? >> so, number one is asset  sensitive banks. The way to think about it is the underlying trends are positive  for the industry, the banks that are best positioned are the ones who are asset sensitive, so we  like state street, for example. And the bigger banks tend to be  more asset sensitive. We also think this investment  banking cycle is gearing up. We've got 25% growth for  investment banking revenues this year and 15% growth for trading  in our large cap estimates, and  if the proposal does get walked  back some, there could be more  capital return. It actually would cause  citigroup's earnings per share  to go up by 18% if there was an  entire non-increase in the  proposal. So we think these are some  bullish factors that can support especially the biggest banks.  >> tom, how much are you  thinking about -- you mentioned  state street, we'll get their  numbers on friday. But the regionals and the  community banks, how much should we be thinking about a potential for an echo of what we got in  the spring of '23? >> well, so i think -- first of  all, the spring of '23 was quite extraordinary.  >> exactly. >> i think that had to do with  the significant change in rates  and how much bond buying the  banks had done during covid. So that has been better managed. And i think it would take rates  to go a lot higher. There would have to be a pretty  significant shock for more  pressure to come there. I think with the smaller banks,  they don't have the non-interest income resources in investment  banking, so their earnings per  share are going to be less  robust. We think they're going to grow  earnings at 6%, even though  there are several banks that we  think will benefit from possibly better or more tailoring for  them in the regulation side. So we think that on a  stock-selected basis, the  current rate worry is an  opportunity to selectively buy  some of the stocks that have now round-tripped the trump bump. So that's how we've been  proceeding. >> tom, it's not as though we're not coming off a really strong  year, though, for so many of the big cap banks. I mean, they outperformed the  s&p by a good margin last year. Do you expect that will be the  case in 2025 as well? >> david, unfortunately, that's  a reflection of how poorly they  did the year before. So, even though they did a big  percentage move -- my experience is, when the earnings profile  for a company is improving,  their earnings per share is  growing, it gives them a chance  to raise dividends, gives them a chance to build their balance  sheet. There's also a real capital  growth story in the banking  industry right now, which i  think is very positive. I have found over my career that that's a good environment for  the stocks, but i think you're  right. I've talked before on your show  about there being coiled  springs. I wouldn't call the sector a  coiled spring, but i do think  there is upside, and really the  best judgment for investors to  make is, is this current rate  worry worth what's happened to  the stocks? because there's a lot of rate  worry in these stocks at the  moment. But let me say one other thing,  though, to be cautious. You've heard me say this before  on your show. The biggest torpedo in the ocean is always credit quality. If rates were to go up so high  that it would re-ignite a  conversation about credit  quality, i do think that would  give investors pause. Our channel checks don't show  anything like th",

          "WITH IN TERMS OF THAT AND I  THINK IN THE JOURNAL THERE WAS  AN INTERVIEW WITH THE INCOMING  HEAD OF THE CEA AND THE COUNCIL  OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS IN FAVOR  OF THIS BUT SPEAKING OF THIS  PUTS GET TO A REPORT BECAUSE IT  IS INVOLVING THE STEEL  INDUSTRY, A COMPANY THAT WE  HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT WHICH  IS U.S. STEEL AND THEY HAVE  SEEN OVER THE WEEKEND AN  IMPORTANT MOVE THE TERMINATION  PROCESS AND REMEMBER PRESIDENT  BIDEN TERMINATED THE DEAL BY  NIPPON TO ACQUIRE U.S. STEEL  WITH 30 DAYS TO DO SO AND NOW  IT HAS BEEN PUSHED OUT THE SAME  DAY THE CURRENT MERGER EXPIRED.  THEY HAVE TIME TO PURSUE THEIR  CASE AGAINST CLEVELAND CLIFFS  AND THE LIKE BUT WE HAVE OTHER  NEWS AND SOMETHING THAT  WOULD'VE COME TO THE FLOOR IF  IN FACT THAT TIMELINE HAD BEEN  MAINTAINED.  THAT IS THAT THE CLEVELAND  CLIFFS WHICH WAS THE COVER BID  SO LONG AGO WHEN THEY FIRST  SOLD AND THEY AGREED TO THAT IN  2023 TO SELL IT TO NIPPON IS  BACK AND BACK AS YOU CAN SEE IN  PARTNERSHIP WITH NUCOR AND IT'S  A POTENTIAL BID AND NO FORCING  FUNCTION HERE FOR THEM TO COME  FORWARD UNLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP  WERE TO DO SOMETHING IN TERMS  OF IMMEDIATELY HAVING THE  TERMINATION AGAIN FOR CHANGING  THINGS AND UNCLEAR WHAT IT  MEANS.  BUT NONETHELESS SOURCES CLOSE  TO THE SITUATION INDICATE THAT  CLEVELAND-CLIFFS HAS PARTNERED  WITH NUCOR WITH A BID FOR THE  COMPANY IN THE HIGH 30s ALL- CASH AS OPPOSED TO THE PREVIOUS  DEAL AND REFLECTIVE OF THE  CHANGE OVERALL IN THE INDUSTRY  WHICH HASN'T BEEN POSITIVE AND  REMEMBER THE DEAL IS 55 SO THAT  PUTS IT IN PERSPECTIVE BUT AS  PART OF THIS CLEVELAND-CLIFFS  WOULD BUY IT AND TURN AROUND  AND SELL THIS KEY UNIT IN  ARKANSAS AND THAT IS WHAT THEY  WANTED AND PREVIOUSLY THEY HAD  TAKEN A LOOK AT IT AND THEY  MADE A BID ALONE AND THERE WERE  ALWAYS ANTITRUST CONCERNS AND  THIS WOULD AMELIORATE THOSE  CONCERNS AND THERE WOULD BE  SOMETHING THAT WENT ALONG WITH  IT AND THEY WOULD KEEP IT IN  PITTSBURGH AND THEY WOULD BRAND  THE STEEL PRODUCT, IRON OR  WOULD BE UNDER THE CLEVELAND- CLIFFS BRAND NAME AS WELL.  NONE OF THIS MAY COME TO THE  FLOOR, BUT IT IS SOMETHING  CERTAINLY INVESTORS WANT TO  KEEP IN MIND AS WE SEE HOW THIS  PROCESS PLAYS OUT OVER WHAT  COULD BE MANY MONTHS IN TERMS  OF THE CONTINUED ATTEMPTS BY  NIPPON TO CHALLENGE THE RULING  AND CHALLENGE CLEVELAND-CLIFFS  AND WHAT THEY SAY WAS  INTERFERENCE IN THEIR DEAL TO  BEGIN WITH BUT THEY ARE  PARTNERED AGAIN AND SOURCES SAY  PARTNERED WITH NUCOR FOR THAT  BID WHETHER IT COMES TO THE  FLOOR OR NOT AND AGAIN FAR  BELOW OF COURSE THE 55 AND I  SHOULD MENTION AS WELL WITH THE  NOMINATING DEADLINE COMING UP  YOU COULD SEE SOME INVESTORS A  GETTING INTO THE FRAY TO KEEP  U.S. STEEL HONEST BUT IF YOU  HEARD THEM I DON'T THINK THERE  IS A NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT  WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR DESIRE  TO TRY TO SEE WITH THE VERY BIG  NUMBER.  AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING ON AND  ON WITH SO MANY THINGS IN THE  UPCOMING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION  WHETHER IT BE THE TIKTOK BAN OR  THIS APPROACH AND WHAT IT MEANS  FOR THE U.S. STEEL DEAL OR  WHETHER IT BE TARIFFS OVERALL  AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THIS  INDUSTRY AND WE WILL GET SOME  INFORMATION ABOUT A WEEK OR SO  WHEN THEY COME INTO OFFICE.  >> I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK  TWICE ABOUT WHETHER TRUMP WOULD  KILL IT AND WHEN TRUMP WAS  RUNNING.  I WILL SAY CLEVELAND-CLIFFS IS  CLOSE TO PRESIDENT ELECT TRUMP.  AND I THINK THERE IS A  POSSIBILITY THAT SOMETHING  COULD HAPPEN HERE.  I DO BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU  SPEAK TO LORENZO, I TELL YOU,  HE IS SO CLOSE TO TRUMP THAT I  REALLY THINK THAT LORENZO HAS  IT DONE AND I THINK IT'S AN  INTERESTING DEAL.  >> THAT IS KIND OF WHAT YOU ARE  DEALING WITH THAT IF HE IS  CLOSE ENOUGH AND IF YOU MOVE  BACK THE TERMINATION DATE WITH  THE BIDEN'S ALREADY SAYING THE  DEAL COULD HAPPEN THEN YOU HAVE  THIS BID ACCORDING TO MY  SOURCES IN THE HIGH 30s ALL- CASH AND WITH THE IMMEDIATE BIG  RIVER TO NUCOR.  >> I THINK THAT CLEVELAND- CLIFFS GETS IT FROM THE  BEGINNING AND I HAVE BEEN  SAYING T",

IF YOU GO BACK TO THE FIRST  TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THEY DID A LOT OF GOOD FOR SPACE. THEY CREATED THE SPACE FORCE. THEY WERE VERY, VERY PROACTIVE  WITH THE SPACE COUNCIL. THEY GAVE THE FIRST LUNAR  COMMERCIAL CONTRACT FOR SPACE  THROUGH NASA.

          ">>> let's welcome a special  guest is here to talk sports  investments.  the markets and more.  avenue capitals chairman and  ceo, marc lasry.  we've got so much to talk  about.  that we would start with sports  because  you are somebody who  looks at sports differently  than most big investors.  people get into it because they  are fan boys and by it seemed  they love and hold onto it for  forever through thick and thin.  you are different.  you are not so sentimentally  involved.  you sold the bucks at  incredible profit.  you get into pickleball and  sold that at a great profit.  look at sports as an actual  business.  you think people don't  understand it.  what you see that others missed  ?  >> part of it went -- what  people miss all sports is how  many people watching it.  simple question.  if you think of hockey, half 1  million people watch it.  baseball, 1 million.  basketball is one and half  million.  what about bull riding ? and  many people watch that quick  >> 200 million ?  >> 200,000.  >> it's 1.2 million.  more than baseball.  >> that shocks me.  >> sailing which three years  ago did not exist.  today got 1.8.  you've got more people watching  ceiling then basketball.  to me, you've got the sports  people are watching so you want  to get into it and invest in  those before they become, i  would say sort of the national  conscience.  >> you think baseball is  overvalued for the number of  people watching or bull riding  is undervalued ?  >> are trying to find sports  undervalued and invest in those  so that five years from now as  they get their new media deals  that's when you will capture  the upside.  >> you've been able to do that  by doing what ? i know your  involved in women's sports.  buying a lot of women's soccer  teams are making bids for them.  what have the most upside  potential ?  >> i think it's women's sports.  the simple reason is -- do you  have little girls ?  >> i do.  >> for joe and i who are  parents, my dad never brought  my sisters and i to the game.  it was just my dad and i. It's  inconceivable to they would not  bring your daughter.  that's what you are having.  you are having this change as  more people are bringing their  daughters and more girls want  to watch other women play  sports.  you wish -- are seeing women's  soccer, basketball.  >> women's sports will only  succeed if more women are  watching those sports ? is a  generational issue or you think  for it to work you need men to  be watching the sports  insignificant numbers.  if you look at football, it's  like 60-40 maybe 70-30 in terms  of men to women.  there still a significant --  >> need to have men watching  it.  this generation -- if you what  when the new york liberty ended  up winning the and be -- wnba  title, you would have been  shocked how many men were there  if you want to that.  you need to have men and women  watching.  i would say today's generation  does not care.  the younger you are, you go to  a woman's game will go to a  men's game.  >> one reason i wanted to talk  to you is what we are watching  college sports.  the name, image and likeness  money has changed the game.  we are talking about things  it's hard to say these will be  student athletes.  focus on the athlete part not  so much on the student part.  you see an opportunity here.  trying to figure out what i  think of that opportunity.  you've said to be looking at  some of these college teams  that the colleges will sell  them or have majority stakes in  them.  that's hard enough to get my  head around.  how does it work, white this  work and what will a change  thinks quick  >> the simple reason is they  don't have a choice.  kids are getting paid.  where as for me growing up the  dream was to play at duke will  play at kentucky or ucla.  today if you are a kid, if  you're getting paid 1 million  from the university of  louisville and that's more from  duke, you will go there.  the cost of that is going up.  the problem for universities is  you need that money to attract  those students.  the only way will get that  money is either alumni will  give you more.  the problem with that is it's  no longer a tax deduction.  i don't know where you when  it's.  >> rutgers.  >> for rutgers to get people to  go, you've got to donate but if  you donate it's 100 % tax  deduction but if you donate to  the athletic department it's  not.  it will get more expensive and  what you will end up doing is  selling these businesses.  not 100 % but sell 50 % of that  so you can keep attracting  students and as you attract  students it's great for the  institution.  >> if you see an pportunity  it's because you think more can  be done.  more profit can be generated  from this.  is it the university giving up  on the profit they're selling  out on it early and it lower  rate ?  >> 100 %. Universities  understand that.  they need the capital.  through the capital, more  people will come to the games.  as more people come o the  games, or people go to the  university.  they understand that.  it's either alumni giving you  the money for people like us.  >> it's an important flywheel  they don't have more since  attracted to the university if  they don't all these bill  programs ?  >> they don't have a choice.  clutch forces getting dominated  by ohio, michigan, all of those. For rutgers, it will be hard.  rutgers needs to attract more  students who will come.  the only way they will do that  is students get paid.  >> the opportunity for you and  the places you are doing this,  can you talk about the places  you are working on a bid right  now ?  >> we are talking to a number  of universities.  for us, universities making 100  million from that.  we will buy that, by half of it  and end up paying 12 times.  universities will get $600 ",

        "Angelica peeples is there and  joins us now as a special  guest.  good morning.  >> good morning.  we are here with dan from  gilead.  >> thanks for having me.  >> i want to start off with  hiv.  you have a big launch you are  expecting this year.  expecting to launch a shot  given twice a year and  prevented nearly all cases of  hiv in the late stage trials.  looking tells about the launch  and how your preparing for what  you see the timeline switching  over from daily pills to the  shot ?  >> gilead science is going into  2025 in a strong position.   one of the most important  things for gilead and public  health is this new  hiv  prevention medicine.  incredibly the first large  trial it showed it was 100 %  effective at preventing hiv in  participants in the trial with  only two shots a year.  it's hard to overstate the  impact this will have on global  public health.  it will change the face of hiv.  we are ready.  we filed with the fda.  we expect approval as early as  a summer and have programs in  developed world and eveloping  world to get this medicine to  the people it can benefit for.  >> you mentioned the impact on  global health and what you've  done.  the plan to make it available  in some low, middle income  families through generics  authorization.  critics say it's not enough and  want to see more from you.  how did you come up with that  plan and you feel it's enough  to address the need out there ?  >> this is a groundbreaking  medicine.  we are approaching our access  programs in an unprecedented  way.  immediately after we saw these  results with the community and  public health officials, we  moved to technology transfer  this medicine to six generic  manufacturers.  the supply and royalty free  basis to 120 low and middle  income countries.  in addition to that, because we  know those generic  manufacturers will get up to  still, we worked with two large  global companies to supply the  drug to no profit to us to more  than 2 million people.  there's much more we can do but  what we are doing is  unprecedented.  if we want to end this epidemic  which is our goal in the will  of public health officials,  everyone has to have access to  this.  >> i want to talk about u.s.  politics.  you are the board of the chair  of phrma.  you've got close pulse on this.  what's your view of this  incoming administration.  how do you see it ?  >> healthcare is not partisan.  it is bipartisan.  what is important in this  country because this is a  country that has he most  medicines, faster access than  any other country in the world.  making sure innovation  continues and also that people  can afford their medicines.  they can pay less out-of-pocket .  with the new administration  is talking about is a focus on  prevention and a focus on  chronic diseases.  for gilead sciences  it means,  medicines that we spoke about  that can be the best tool to  end the epidemic or some other  medicines we have like our self  therapy that the one-time  treatment pictures certain  forms of blood cancer.  that's in line with what the  admin station is talking about.  we look to working with this  administration and new congress  to make sure these legislation  and policies can be supported  for the american people.  >> we have a question back at  the exchange ?  >> it's good to see you, dan.  let's talk about where the  funding comes for your hiv  medication.  i know you will be giving a lot  of it away and getting out  there.  it's been either governments  paying for this medication or  private philanthropy,  philanthropic groups that have  raised the funding for this.  where do you anticipate the  funding coming from it for this  time ? this question if ornate  will be cut in the incoming  administration ?  >> it's a great question.  good to see you.  for a medicine like this, this  is a once in a decade medicine.  it was the medicine that  received the science magazine  medicine award last year to put  that in context for what he  could do for public health.  we believe the funding  mechanisms to your point  privately and publicly are  there to support this.  we've already been working with  the global fund to make this  arrangement and make sure to  million people can receive this  in the first three years.  governments we've been speaking  to our paying attention to  this.  if you can end the epidemic in  your country or in countries  around the world, the impact",

          "Tesla shows down 3 %.  >>> for more on the markets  ahead of the king inflation  data, we want to bring in the  head of u.s. Equity strategy at  rbc capital markets.  your year end target for the  s&p 500 is 6600.  how confident you feel and that  given the pullback we've seen.  >> we were honest with people  came into this year.  the uncertainty factor is  elevated coming into this year.  i spent as much time talking  about the barricade case.  we were clear with the 6600 we  expect a 5 % to 10 % pullback  to materialize.  we get beyond 10 %, i think the  target is at risk.  we can withstand a 5 % to 10 %  move.  looks like that's where we are  headed.  close to the 5 %.  >> what are you expecting for  this week ? the cpi and ppi  coming up.  ppi and cpi.  earning seasons that kicks into  gear.  what should we be bracing for ?  >> they both matter.  i was talking to my rate  strategists.  interest rates and the fed call  reverberate on the multiple.  that's one thing we talked  about coming into this year.  with the fed pausing in our  guys changing their call to see  the fed is done and sing  january was the last one.  you will not get more will  double expansions.  the heavy lifting has to be  done on the earning side.  we feel pretty good about the  consensus numbers.  they are at 273.  my modeling is at 271.  if you look back to last year,  this reporting season companies  went out with downward guidance  to keep expectations low.  in the short term, that's  something temperatures to see  if we get that again.  >> inflation is problematic  because it not only eats into  the idea of the feds heading  rate again.  it eats into company's margins.  if earnings were going to be  strong, you hope you don't have  a rising inflation pick.  >> i'm not seeing in the  quantitative studies we do.  we read a lot of transcripts  top to bottom.  there's only so much you can  do.  the last few quarters we've  sensed almost a sneaky kind of  focus on cost like focusing on  it without seeing it.  if you look at 2025 bottom-up  consensus expectations for  operating margins in the s&p up  and coming down since last june  since -- it impacts the margins. It affects these vibes.  we are waiting for the vibes to  pick up.  and be strong in the new year.  inflation does way on the vibes  for the consumers.  >> you are doubling down on  financials.  you had conviction in this.  expecting regulatory oversight  would loosen up a bit.  we have seen a pullback figure  sticking with this.  >> i think we've seen a lot of  the postelection enthusiasm.  we've seen let's take a breath  and wait and get some  legislation and see how things  pan out.  financials were not so caught  up in things like tariffs.  it's more the regulatory  backdrops.  at the strong tailwind for this  year.  i never liked financials when  you go in reporting season.  i like them better when the  froth has come out and the  expectations are lower.  i don't mind this set up.  >> was surprised to see you  downgrading energy from what it  had been.  we're talking about wti.  the highest level we've seen.  >> we had survey results and  the last -- we do the survey  once a quarter.  the last quarters the effort --  analyst has come down a notch.  if you look at the utility  analyst, very high enthusiasm.  he has five different questions  in four of the five they were  at the top or second.  the enthusiasm was coming  through.  i talked myself into this  overweight back in december  windows marketing with european  and canadian and u.s.  investors.  there's not great evaluation  for strong earnings.  there's the a.i.  dynamic they are politically  gnostics.  i don't have to solve for what  will be happening in  washington.  i've been looking for this  drawdown and it's an area that  gives us that defense.  we had to move energy down.  we tend to overweight three  sectors.  a lot of things we like about  it i've been sitting on and  overweight for a long time but  didn't work and kept expecting  the geopolitics to bail me out  to me that risk premium and bid  the space up.  it's doing it as i've upgraded  it.

          ">>> welcome back.  we'll get the final numbers on  the christmas shopping season  with the government's retail  sales report that's going to  happen on thursday.  but before that, senior  economics reporter the  professor, steve luceman joins  us now.  our cnbc nrf retail monitor.  good morning to you, steve.  >> yeah, holiday shoppers  finished the year with a strong  surge that brought retail  spending in our retail monitor  up to nearly 5% percent  combined year over year for  november and december.  let's look right now at  december.  retail sales ex auto and gas  rising over november.  that is the strongest monthly  gain in the 27 months of data  we have for the monitor.  taking out restaurants as well  showed an even stronger 2.2%  gain.  the data powered by real credit  card spending from it affinity  solutions showed a 7.2% year  over year gain for our headline  index and 8.4% for the quarter.  the late thanksgiving meant  december benefited from two key  shopping days.  the sunday after thanksgiving  and cyber monday were both in  december.  they're usually in november.  so we put the two together to  see what the holiday season was  like.  the headline rising a robust  4.9%.  the core up 5.1.  a good christmas by any  measure.  the nrf saying, households are  in decent financial shape as  the economy remains on solid  footing with low unemployment,  growing incomes and continued  deceleration in inflation in  goods.  looking at the two months  combined by sector, you can see  all kinds of good christmas  shopping stuff.  non-store retailers surging.  general merchandise up 6.2.  health and personal care, 4.5.  gas stations, they maybe  provided funds for that  spending.  they were down 3.5%.  electronics and appliances.  after november they had a  strong rebound in december.  the monitor can't measure  retailer profitability and  whether you have last minute  christmas rush resulting from  end of season bargains or,  andrew, if they were full price  sales.  we're getting someixed  commentary so far from the  retailers.  >> steve, how correlated are  these numbers or have these  numbers been with the numbers  we get from the government  historically?  is this like an adp style job  situation and then we see jobs  report from the bls and we go,  they don't seem to be the same?  how do you think about that?  >> it's a good question,  andrew.  first of all, i will say this.  we are just learning how these  things are working together.  we back tested them and on the  back test, in other words, the data we ran before we made it  public.  we were more closely correlated  with the revisions.  the difference between this  data and the government data is  the government fills in some of  its data initially through  surveys.  not actual sales.  all of this data is actual  sales.  and the last time i looked we  were like within .3 or .4 above  it.  this time around it's going to  be a little different because  the government does its  seasonal adjustment a little  different.  they won't have this issue of  not having the two big holiday  shopping days inside of their  number for november.  so they're going to be a little  different.  that's why i take the two  together.  then we'll see on thursday how  november and december come  together.  but our data correlates well  with what you had liz on last  week from bank of america, she  showed strong sales.  our data is a little bit wider,  we think by income group.  bank of america clients tend to  be a little wealthier perhaps.  we're all across the spectrum.  we got to watch it, andrew.  you're asking a good question  because we are in a new era of  big private sector data.  able to make it public.  we're trying correctly to  seasonally adjust it.  so far it's correlated  reasonably well but it's not  spot on the dime.  >> that stock market continued  to do the totally wrong thing  based on that jobs report on  friday.  >> yeah, look, there were  people out there, joe, who  agreed with me and said hey,  it's a good number.  it's good to have americans  employed and others who were  scared that -- i guess there's  two components of that.  the first is that you have this  possibility of rising inflation  that's going to have to cause  the fed to reverse.  and the other is that the fed  could be making a mistake.  that's why if you read -- the  fed is going to take a step  back and they're going to watch  how all of this plays out.  how it plays out as to whether  or not it's inflation behind  th",

        "About now.  nasdaq off 267 points.  s&p off about 52 points.  we should probably show you the  treasury yields right now.  because that is having an  impact on all.  the ten year has continued to  climb.  want to bring in chief market  strategist for the americas jp  morgan asset management.  what is going on?  >> i think it's a continuation  of some of the repricing that  we've been seeing for about  five weeks now.  i do think you're right, it's  very much being driven by a  shift higher in yield along the  curve, but i think most  importantly in ten year yield  and in specifically real yields.  so i don't buy this is all  about higher inflation  expectations or reset fed  expectations.  it's very much driven by  uncertainty in a different part  of dc.  so really i think we're all  bracing for a week from now  after the inauguration the  flurry of information we're  going to get and how we can  shape our expectations of  economic forecasts and risk  premium from here on out.  that reprices assets across the  board.  >> so what's the full reprice  look like?  when's that happening?  >> so i do think it's already  happening.  if you look at just the s&p  500, maybe you'll miss it.  it's off 4% off time highs.  the median stock is now down  about 15% from its 2024 high.  so i do think there's already a  bit of repricing and  understanding that it's not all  good, it's not all bad coming  out of dc.  it's going to take us a little  while to figure out how it nets  out for different companies.  and the scale, the scope, the  sequencing of policy.  what of course hasn't fully  repriced is more of airgap  tech.  more high valuation, high  expectation sectors.  and that could drive a bigger  repricing in the index.  overall given it's 40% now.  >> i know that what you do and  jamie dimon does don't always  correlate exactly.  we were commentingen this  interview where he called  himself cautiously pessimistic  as opposed to cautiously  optimistic.  do you have the same view?  >> i would say we're cautiously  optimistic about the economic  outlook.  last year was realizing  corporate household balance  sheets are doing fine.  we're normalizing across a  variety of indicators.  labor market.  inflation.  we're also cautiously  optimistic about the long run  outlook.  also a big story last year was  the improvement on the supply  side.  where we're more cautiously, i  wouldn't say pessimistic.  the reason for caution is in  portfolios.  there is a cost to pay a very  strong but very concentrated  returns.  when we speak to investors,  what was a 60/40 allocation is  now a 75/25 allocation.  that was 50/50 growth value is  now 60/40.  there's a lot of focus on  recent winners.  that doesn't set you up for  strong returns going forward.  >> maybe a curve ball.  maybe not.  it's obviously in the  headlines.  does what's happening in los  angeles do you think have any  meaningful impact on gdp over  the next several quarters?  if not longer?  by the way, you could argue it  could have a big impact in a  good way in so far as there's  going to be spending.  >> you see that with natural  disasters.  there's a temporary at times  negative effect which is made  up later as there's rebuilding  that takes place and then it  just nets out over time.  but i do think it brings up a  really important point around  when you speak to clients about  inflation, you know, we speak  about it in economic and market  terms year over year.  yes, it's normalizing.  but there's a cost there around  auto insurance, home insurance,  which is not just about  california; right?  it's about a lot of states in  the country.  i think that explains a lot  more of the malaise, the  frustration about the current  costs and about the current  economy.  that's not just reflected in of  course how we think about it as  economists or investors.  >> what do you think just so i  understand, what do you think  has happened in the last five  weeks?  why do you think the mind shift  has changed?  everybody was in this, i don't  know if it was a trump trade.  i don't know what you think it  was.  november, december, it was like  we are off to the races.  then everybody went for the  holidays and decided -- or  maybe even before the holidays  decided maybe not.  >> yeah, really before the  holidays.  so we started pricing in the  republican sweep mid september  so there was quite a long  period there.  and then you started getting to  december, you know, you start  getting into the weeds of the  details.  so what exactly is going to be  the sequencing of policy.  how is that going to net out.  is it going to be a net  positive, net negative for  different assets.  for equity specifically there  was more of a focus on the  positive aspects.  on friday we'll get the  forecasts around the deficit  and debt projections.  that's what's driving this 80  basi",

        "COMPANIES IN THE WORLD THAT  WOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD A VERY  GOOD EARBUD, BUT IT JUST --  APPLE HAS A SPECIFIC PROTOCOL  THAT THEY BUILT INTO THE iPHONE  THAT ALLOWS AIRPODS TO BASICALLY CONNECT TO IT AND IT'S JUST MORE SEAMLESS BECAUSE THEY ENABLED  THAT, BUT THEY DON'T LET ANYONE  ELSE USE THE PROTOCOL. IF THEY DID, THERE COULD BE  BETTER AIRPODS OUT THERE. WHEN YOU TOUCH ON THIS, THEY GET SUPER TOUCHY AND WRAP THEIR  DEFENSE OF IT IN WELL, IF WE LET OTHER COMPANIES PLUG INTO OUR  THING, THAT WOULD VIOLATE  PEOPLE'S PRIVACY AND SECURITY. NO, JUST DO A BETTER JOB WITH  THE PROTOCOL. >> THAT WAS MARK ZUCKERBERG ON  FRIDAY TAKING A SHOT AT RIVAL  APPLE. JOINING US IS GENE MUENSTER. GENE, YOU OWN APPLE. DO YOU THINK THERE ARE LONGER  TERM ISSUES AS A RESULT? >> I DON'T, BECKY. THIS IS BAD BLOOD BETWEEN THE  COMPANIES. ZUCKERBERG HAS BEEN ON THIS  TIRADE GAINST APPLE FOR A LONG  TIME. OF COURSE, HE DOESN'T LIKE WHAT  THEY'RE DOING WITH THE APP STORE WHICH BASICALLY BLOCKS THEM OUT. IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR META  TO GET ANY SORT OF EDGE IN TERMS OF HAVING THE DIRECT CONNECTION  WITH THEIR CUSTOMER. I THINK THAT HAS BEEN THE  ESSENCE OF WHAT HAS PUSHED THIS  AS FAR AS IT HAS. I THINK THIS IS BAD BLOOD AND I  THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE  TRIED TO MAKE SOME PEACE, BUT IT HASN'T COME TO FRUITION. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE  CONCEPT, THEY HAVEN'T INNOVATED. THEY HAVE. SERVICES WATCH AIRPODS IS 30% OF THEIR BUSINESS. THEY HAVE STALLED IN TERMS OF  VISION PRO CAR. THAT HASN'T TAKEN OFF. AT THE MOST BASIC THE MOST BASI  I THINK THIS IS JUST TWO  COMPANIES THAT DON'T SEE EYE TO  EYE.  THE FUNDAMENTAL REASON IS  BECAUSE META FEELS THAT APPLE  HAS CONTROL OF ITS DESTINY AND  ZUCKERBERG DOES NOT LIKE THAT  THIS.  >> IS IT ANTICOMPETITIVE  BEHAVIOR THAT RISES TO AN  OVERSIGHT LEVEL?  >> I DON'T THINK SO.  THE APP STORE, HOW THEY OPERATE  THAT.  YOU KNOW, CAN YOU HAVE  INDEPENDENT APP STORES AND THE  STEERING.  ALL THAT IS RELATED TO HOW  ZUCKERBERG'S COMMENTARY HAS  PLAYED OUT.  AT THE END OF THE DAY IS THAT  APPLE HAS BEEN LEANING BACK,  ZUCKERBERG SAID IT IN THAT  PREPARED COMMENT THERE IS THAT  APPLE LEANS BACK ON THE FACT  THEY ULTIMATELY NEED TO HAVE  THIS OVERSIGHT BECAUSE OF  SECURITY AND JUST A CLEANER APP  STORE.  I THINK THAT THAT HAS STOOD UP  ON THE REGULATORY FRONT.  SO I WOULD BE REALLY SURPRISED  TO SEE ANY SORT OF SUBSTANCE  CHANGES TO THE POLICIES.  I DON'T THINK THERE'S GOING TO  BE ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE  ELEVATED AGAINST THE APP STORE  IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.  >> GENE, LAST EEK WAS A ROUGH  WEEK FOR THE TECH STOCKS.  YOU WERE LOOKING AT THE NASDAQ  PULLING BACK MORE THAN 2.25%.  NOW DOWN MORE THAN 5% FROM THE  ALL TIME HIGHS.  THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE  WONDERING WHAT 2025 IS GOING TO  BRING.  YOU THINK THERE ARE TWO HUGE  THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING THIS  WEEK FOR TECH.  THE FIRST ONE KIND OF CAUGHT MY  ATTENTION.  THE CPI NUMBERS TOMORROW ARE  INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT YOU THINK.  YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THAT?  WHY CPI CAN HAVE SUCH A BIG  IMPACT?  >> IT'S THE RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN INTEREST RATES AND  RISK.  OF COURSE IF RATES STAY UP  HIGHER FOR LONGER OR BECOME  ELEVATED, IT MAKES IT LESS  ATTRACTIVE FOR INVESTORS TO GO  INTO RISKIER ASSETS LIKE OWNING  STOCKS.  I THINK THAT RELATIONSHIP WE  SAW OF COURSE PLAY OUT IN A  REALLY BIG WAY WHEN RATES WERE  GOING UP A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.  THIS STILL PLAYS AND NAGS AT  INVESTORS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH  INTEREST RATES.  I THINK THE REASON WHY THE CPI  NUMBER HAS MAYBE AN OUTSIZED  IMPACT THIS WEEK VERSUS MAYBE  SIX MONTHS AGO IS THAT THE  MARKET IS HIGHER.  I THINK THAT INVESTORS, TECH  INVESTORS ARE LOOKING FOR THAT  REASON TO SELL.  THIS COULD BE A HOT CPI NUMBER  COULD BE A NEAR TERM CATALYST.  THIS IS GOING TO BE A MESSY  WEEK.  THERE'S A COUNT BALANCE TO THIS  WEEK TOO.  TSM WHO HAS GIVEN THEIR  DECEMBER REVENUE NUMBERS BUT  THEY'RE GOING TO BE REPORTING  ON THURSDAY GIVING OUTLOOK FOR  THIS YEAR.  OF COURSE THEY'RE CRITICAL IN  TERMS OF BUILDING A LOT OF  ADVANCE NOTES FOR AI CHIPS.  SO I THINK AI TRADE MIGHT GET A  LITTLE BIT OF SOME REASSURANCE  WITH THAT TSM COMMENTARY.  OVERALL THIS IS GOING TO BE A  MESSY WEEK.  OF COURSE ALL EYES ARE GOING TO  TURN TO WHAT BIG TECH IS GOING  TO SAY NEXT WEEK.  >> THE BIG ISSUE YOU THINK IS  AI IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING  THAT CONTINUES IN REALITY NOT A  HYPE MACHINE.  AT LEAST FOR THE REST OF THIS  YEAR AND PROBABLY THE YEAR  AFTER THAT AS WELL.  >> UNDOUBTEDLY.  I WANT TO PUT SOME QUICK  PARAMETERS AROUND THAT.  FOR MOST PEOPLE AI IS JUST A  BUZZ WORD.  THE DAILY ACTIVE USERS OF  CHATGPT IS ABOUT 150 MILLION.  2.5MILLION WHEN IT COMES TO  GOOGLE.  THIS IS RELATIVELY SMALL.  I THINK IT IS AN UNDENIABLE  TRUTH THAT THE SUBSTANCE WILL  EXCEED THE HYPE.  THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT HOW  TO INVEST IN THAT.  WILL THE MAG SEVEN CONTINUE TO  LEAD THE WAY?  WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST  COUPLE WEEKS HERE IS SOME OF  THESE SMALLER COMPANIES, IF YOU  MEASURE IT BY THE LOOP LOUP  FRONTIER TECH COMPANIES, THAT'S  UP 2.5% THIS YEAR.

        "Morning from bill ackman and  pershing square. It's a complicated transaction. I'll give you top line  information. He is acquiring the howard  hughes holding company. This is an under performer in  truth, but buying at a premium. Well talk about the premium in a second. Perhaps the larger story is this acquisition that effectively  bill ackman is going to attempt  to make now, would become a  permanent capital vehicle for  pershing square and puts  pershing square in the business  of buying controlling stakes in  operating businesses so much so  that the way bill ackman is now  describing this transaction is  to compare this deal with the  first deal that warren buffett  ever made. >> this is his way. >> with ies to mr.  buffett, hhh would be the modern bay berkshire hathaway with  controlling interest in  operating company. Pershing square up here and all  of the different funds. You remember that pershing  square sought to go public in  the ipo earlier this year. That was temporarily withdrawn,  but my understanding is that  they could decide to go public  again in the future. So, this is sort of an initial  step in this permanent capital  effort for pershing square. >> this is another vehicle? >> this would remain a public  vehicle and that's why it's  complicated. We should talk about how this  deal is going to go. There could be the additional  deal with pershing square till  goes public. We have the permanent feature. It's complicated. That's why i said bear with us  as we walk through this. Pershing square, we should say  bill ackman and their team own  44% of pershing square. In terms of this deal, howard  hughes has been an under  performer and not delivered  dividends. Part of his bet on this company  is he believes in the next  couple years it's going to start producing lots of cash and that  would obviously be a  requirement, if you will, to be  a successful venture to produce  enough cash to become not an  insurance company, of course,  but create a lot of ebitda and  start buying lots of other  businesses. In terms of this transaction  itself, though, what you are  looking at if you are a  shareholder of howard hughes  today, you have the option  effectively of cashing out  completely or you have the  option of rolling in which is  what they're going to be doing. You will be able to effectively  roll into this transaction which then be controlled by bill  ackman. >> they purchased a majority  share? >> they purchase the majority  share of the company. You could effectively think of  it in a unique way of take  private or take private public. Here's how it works. The consideration in cash is $85 per share. You are looking at $81.25 which  is a 38% premium before the news and 18% to the closing price on  friday. They are saying that there has  been speculation of what would  happen to this business, but you are also allowed if you want to  roll in the way they are to take a combination of cash and stock. There are going to be some  shareholders who want to go on  the ride with bill ackman.  >> you can't pledge your whole  shares because they need to buy  a majority of the shares that  take over? >> it gets complicated because  there are two ways to do this. That's why i said we'll have to  spend time going through this. You need enough shareholders to  roll in to make this all work. If it's all cash, that creates a new kind of challenge because i  don't believe they have enough  cash. The math is $1.5 billion total  cash proceeds from pershing  square and bond to finance this. Divide $85 per share. That's going to be the money  available on the cash basis if  the shareholders vote for it. Of course, this will require a  vote as well. We're going to have to get into  some of this. I apologize. It is super complicated. >> a $3.6 billion market cap. Pershing square has owned a  portion of this for a while? >> a huge portion. They will roll their shares in  and they are hoping others will  roll in with them and pay out  cash to the others. That's why you are seeing the  shares trade right now. I think that's a decent  explanation. >> you know where this company  came from? why ackman knows about it? general growth. >> this is the real estate  piece. >> he made so much money. It's almost -- that was one of  the great home runs for ackman. >> this business has not made a  lot of money. The stock has been an under  performer for a very long time  now. He's been out there and he loves the management team. He has been talking about the  management team for a very long  time. It has not been a great winner. There, we're showing you howard  hughes over the last year. Look at it over the decade and  this is a business that has not  provided a dividend. >> master of communities  business.  >> think about it.  >> makin",

          "Top ten names you need to own in the space. Dan ives sitting here with me. Dan, 20-year hitting over 5%. The real thing we are looking at is the 10-year at 4.75%. Putting a lot of pressure on  tech on top of the rising  dollar. How do tech stocks move higher  with the set up? >> i think there are two things  playing out. One thing, fundamentally, cap ex and what we are seeing is strong on the consumer side. That is actually better than  expected. We will see that in the  earnings. We've gone through this in last  few years. The ten-year bond risk off. We will have these moments. Our view is these are the  opportunities to own the  winners. Frank, i only think we're  halfway through the bull market. >> i want to talk about  palantir. Under pressure again. After the best performing stock  in the s&p last year, we  continue to see a selloff and  the stock under pressure. Are you concerned about the  valuation like so many other  people? they believe the valuation is  too high and it is difficult for the company to live up to the  lofty valuation.  >> if you miss the valuation,  you miss the last 20 years. Palantir, i continue to view as  the next oracle or next  salesforce. When i look at a.i. Revolution. When i look at numbers. $2 trillion of a.i. Cap ex in  the incomes few years. Where karp plays out the white  knuckle periods. I think this could be a  three-digit stock as it plays  out. These are the times that you  look at the winners and how to  own them.  >> you and i talked about this  before. I'm looking at the one-week  chart of the dollar. We did get a spike after the  jobs report. It was still moving higher last  week. I know you are bullish on tech. You are always bullish to be  fair. Out of the top ten, which do you see as most likely to be i am  pangt   -- impacted by the rise in  dollar? >> apple will have headwind. I think the street is already  factoring in some of that in  terms of estimates. I don't think this becomes that  dramatic if we actually start to see this curtail, but it just  comes down to, frank, a month  from now is a different picture  because of the fundamental  picture that plays out in tech  as this actually is seeing  strength being led by the a.i.  revolution.  >> we have seen a lot of  weakness in tech, dan. We have seen mike's article over the weekend. If you look at the average bull  market, this bull market has  more to go. Tech doesn't seem like it. Do the concentration. Tech is the engine moving it  forward. If we go to the next fed meeting and the fed continues to be  hawkish, that seems to be the  inflection point. >> that's also why you have a  diversified view in terms of  oracle or microsoft or high  growth names like palantir or  tesla and others. Our playbook has been you use  these opportunities to own the  winners. I get the bears will come out. The bond market, the ten-year  will ultimately dominate. That's why we're only halfway  through the bull market. It is not time to hit the exit. >> not just about the  fundamentals. Which one tells us where the  tech trade is with the sense in  the bull market and confidence  in the a.i. Trade? >> i think microsoft along with  nvidia. Those are the best in terms of  barometers with a.i. That stock has been under  pressure. Ultimately, look at apple. Apple with zuck. Specifically coming out of  china.  >> you mentioned zuck. We want to play zuck on the joe  rogan podcast.  >> because they have been so off their game in not really  releasing innovative things. The good news about the tech  industry is it is super dynamic  and things are getting invested. If you don't do a good job for  ten years, eventually, you will  get beat by someone.  >> your take. Aggressive take from mark  zuckerberg. Ever since he started the mma  classes, he is a different guy. A chain on. A different thing. In all seriousness --  >> mma battle with cook and  apple. It comes down to 30% with the  commission and what they're  taking and this is -- we're  seeing this game of thrones play out with meta and apple and  across tech because of where  we're going into it. It's frustration from meta's  perspective. For apple, as we talked about,  this is the year they have",

          "Zervos of jeffries. Good morning, good to see you. >> good to be here.  >> what do you make of the  weakness in the pre-market? we saw weakness after the better than expected jobs report with  bond yields spike. Is that continuing over into  monitor day or is something els  play? >> it is continuing and it feels a little bit rough, but i think  the important point of what you  just said with bond yields is  long-term interest rates did not spike. 30-year bond at 4.93%. It spiked to 5%. It is back to 4.95. It is almost unchanged from  where it was prepay roll. What is mogollon ving is the fr. People are getting nervous that  the fed will have to stay much  higher for much longer. That's actually not going to be  the right signal for the fed. So, the interesting thing about  the price action said to me on  friday and is continuing today  into monday is even though we  saw this unbelievable strength  in the u.s. Economy and people  are optimistic about the  strength going forward, they are getting increasingly worried the fed will have to make a mistake  and they are getting nervous of  the prospects for growth.  >> i'm looking at the chart. It did spike on friday after the jobs report, but 1.5%. A huge move for currency over  that period of time. You talk about the concentration in the market. These big tech stocks get  revenues overseas. Do you think the strength of the dollar would hit the earnings? is that something that is not  priced into the market? is that something you are  watching? >> watching the dollar closely. That is tied into the yields. For sure, the markets are going  to get nervous about that ever  strengthening dollar. That is putting us in a less  competitive position in the  united states and that is making it harder to do business with  that competition. That's going to weigh on every  stock, not just the tech stocks, but anybody that looks at  valuation globally is saying  these stocks look even more  overvalued relative to their  competitors overseas. That's going to be a tricky  thing to deal with. That is also a sign that it's  not inflation expectations or  credibility or some story that  the u.s. Is losing control of  the policy vis-a-vis inflation. If that was the case, people  wouldn't be flocking to the  dollar. This is not an inflation story. This is the story the fed is  getting -- i don't want to say  tricked, but forced to stay a  little too high a little too  long because they're getting  mixed signals from the market  and there is also a potential  for a little battle with the  trump administration and jay  powell as we saw before in the  trump 1.0 administration. >> david, we don't want to get  too far ahead. Let's focus on today's action if you don't mind. I want to get your word of the  day. The word of what we should  expect today or this week.  >> i think the word of the day  is the university of michigan or umich as we call it. That piece of data got under the skin of the market on friday. It was a huge spike in the long  run expectations from 2.8% to  3.5%. It is generally revised down. That has the market very  nervous. We're not seeing that in the  price action. We're seeing that as a scare. Meaning people don't think  inflation expectations are doing that, but the reason why the fed is going to be a little more  stubborn in terms of its rate  moves in 2025. That's just got people pricing  in a mistake more aggressively. I think that's how i",

        "Joining me now is jeremy  schwartz at wisdomtree. >> great to see you, frank.  >> we see a lot of volatility in the market and declines in the  markets. Do you think all of this has to  do with the fed and people  having less confidence in the  fed cutting one time this year  and definitely having less  confidence in them cutting two  times this year? >> as you said, the bond yields  is all about the bond yields. The ten year, we were on with  you in december and saying we  could get to 5%. I think that's still our  baseline that we get from 5% to  5.5% at the high end. Now it would be a normal and  healthy economy. It is possible we have the yield curve uninverted, but the  ten-year is around 50 or 55  basis points higher. The normal is 00 to 120. That would be another 50 basis  points hawaiier  higher from he. That does put more competition. The earnings yield is less than  the ten-year treasury compared  to tips. There is more competition.  >> you are saying the bond  market is creating competition. Not necessarily the bond yields  have a fundamental reason to  selloff. I do want to ask, we see so much mania in the markets. We see the a.i. Trade. Are you seeing sentiment has  shifted so much that people  thought there was no alternative to anything but equities because of the possibility of a  reasonable mind set or are they  scared of the volatility and  equity market? >> you know, the stocks are also the present value of cash flow. You get a higher discount rate  and it brings down valuations. The quantum is its own world. The mag seven is 30 times  earnings. The quantum is on future  expectations. Those are really speculative  stocks. If you look at the core s&p 500  and tech stocks surrounding it,  you just talked about  zuckerberg's comments and apple. Some of those are not cheap  stocks. They have to deliver on the  earnings. They have been. They have been delivering. They deserve the 30 times  earnings for the mag seven  versus the 17 times for  everything else. As that ten-year peaks out,  that's where you get another  move higher in the markets. It is, again, a healthy economy  that's driving the ten-year  yields higher.  >> you are saying once the  yields peak out, you can get up  to 5.25. Once people feel it is stable,  the bull market continues. Mike santoli had an interesting  article over the weekend. Any thoughts about the  volatility just being normal or  overblown? the blue line is the average  bull mark. It continues for 800 days. The continued line is the orange line is 600 days. Do you get the idea you are  seeing churns in the bull market and we have more room to run and the short-term volatility is  maybe overblown? >> i think it's all natural from what we see going on now. We think this pull back, as he  said, the ten-year can go  higher. Eventually, you will get this  rotation. We haven't seen that value or  small cap. That is relying on the fed  because they are the ones paying the rates. The valuations are being  pressured a little bit which is  normal and healthy. As people get confident the  yields stop rising, we get  continued --  >> jeremy, we are almost out of  time. You talk about the wisdomtree  wtf. You believe it will  reaccelerate. What is sparking in your mind as we go to 2025? >> what i love about this fund,  they do a lot of dividends and  buybacks which is around 7%. You have a 13 pe. Ten points lower than the s&p. These are ten points less and  they are doing buybacks. The companies and management are voting with their feet and  buying back their ",

          "HE'S HERE. LET ME INTRO YOU. LET ME GIVE YOU WHAT YOU  DESERVE. IN A GOOD WAY. THE DOW TUMBLED 00 POINTS ON  FRIDAY. THE FED HITS THE PAUSE ON THE  RATE CUT. JOINING US IS TOM LEE FROM  FUNDSTRAT AND CNBC CONTRIBUTOR. I DO REMEMBER YOU SORT OF BEING  POSITIVE OVERALL ABOUT THE  MARKET THIS YEAR, BUT WITH SOME  TREPIDATION NEAR TERM. MOST OF YOUR CALLS, RECENTLY,  HAVE BEEN LESS ON THE STRENGTH  OF THE ECONOMY AND MORE ON  INFLATION DATA. SOME OF YOUR -- WHEN YOU WERE  CALLING THINGS, S&P IS GOING TO  END THE WEEK 8% HIGHER BECAUSE  OF INFLATION OR SOMETHING. WE GOT INFLATION THIS WEEK. THERE ARE CONCERNS. I TIE A LOT OF THE WEAKNESS IN  THE MARKET TO THAT. ARE THESE IMPORTANT NUMBERS? >> IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE, AS  YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN CORRECTING  NOW FOR ALMOST A MONTH. 23 TRADING DAYS AND THIS  WEDNESDAY IS AN IMPORTANT DAY  BECAUSE IT'S A POSSIBLE TURNING  POINT FOR MARKETS AND I WOULD  LIKE TO SEE CPI COME IN  BELOW .25 OR SO. I THINK THAT WOULD GIVE THAT  JOLT OF CONFIDENCE TO MARKETS ON TOP OF EARNINGS, WHICH IS GOING  TO BE A POSITIVE CATALYST, BUT  FOR INVESTORS IN THE NEAR TERM,  THEY HAVE TO RIDE OUT THE  VOLATILITY BECAUSE YIELDS HERE  HAVE MADE PEOPLE NERVOUS. NOT NECESSARILY DETERIORATE TO  THE LONG TERM OUTLOOK, BUT NEAR  TERM. >> ARE THEY SMART THE YIELDS OR  NOT GIVING US THE CORRECT  SIGNAL? YOU SOUND REALLY LIKE YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT THE INFLATION DATA  THIS WEEK. >> UH, I'LL HAVE A BETTER SENSE  OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS AS WE  SORT OF FINALIZE OUR  EXPECTATIONS ARE, BUT THE ONLY  HESITATION WE HAVE IS THAT THE  HURRICANES LAST YEAR HAVE  MUDDLED SOME OF THE INFLATION  QUALITY BECAUSE FOR INSTANCE,  HOTEL RESERVATIONS WOULD GO UP  BECAUSE OF THE NATURAL DISASTERS AND IT WILL HAPPEN NOW WITH THE  L.A. FIRES. I THINK IT WILL MUDDLE USED CAR  PRICES AS WELL. YOU HAVE TO REPLACE THE CARS. >> IF IT WEREN'T MUDDLED, YOU  THINK INFLATION ISN'T THAT BIG  OF A CONCERN. WHEN YOU SAY A TURNING POINT IN  THE MARKETS, IF WE HAVE BEEN  DOWN FOR A MONTH, TURNING POINT  DOESN'T MEAN FURTHER WEAKNESS,  YOU THINK WE MIGHT BE MAKING A  BOTTOM THIS WEEK? >> YES, OUR TECHNICIAN MARK  THINKS 5,700 COULD BE THE  TURNING POINT. IT COULD HAPPEN WEDNESDAY MAYBE  2% DOWN FROM HERE. THAT'S WHERE THE MARKET COULD  MAKE A STAND. I THINK IF WE LIFT THE CLOUD OF  THE MUDDLING AND WALLER SAID  MOST OF THE INFLATION WAS ABOUT  MUTED PRICES. THE REAL PRICE OF INFLATION WAS  MUCH LOWER. I STILL THINK THAT IS THE CASE. INFLATION IS WEAKER WHEN YOU  LOOK AT HOUSING, ET CETERA, ONCE WE GET THROUGH THAT NOISE. INVESTORS, I THINK, SHOULDN'T BE SOME GLUM. I THINK EARNINGS SEASON IS  SOMETHING THAT REALLY SOLIDIFIES IF EARNINGS GROWTH IS 10% EX  ENERGY AND EARNING GROWTH 5%,  THAT'S A GOOD REASON TO BE  OWNING EQUITIES. >> IS THE FED LESS SIGNIFICANT  RIGHT NOW WITH THEIR RATE CUT? I DON'T CARE. THAT'S NOT WHAT I BASE THE  MARKET'S GOING TO DO. ARE PEOPLE STILL DYING FOR  ANOTHER COUPLE OF CUTS OR I  THINK WE'VE BEEN LUCKY TO HAVE  GOT TEN WHAT WE'VE LREADY GOTTEN AND HOPE INFLATION DOESN'T COME  BACK.  >> I AGREE WITH YOU. I THINK THE BEST CASE IS THE FED DOING ONE CUT BECAUSE THE  ECONOMY'S STRONG ENOUGH AND THEY ARE STILL DOVISH. THEY WILL MAKE THEIR WAY TO  NEUTRAL. IF THEY PUSH THE CUTS TO 2026  AND 2027, THAT'S A LONGER RATE  TO SUPPORT MARKETS. PART OF THE HESITATION IS WE  HAVE THE NEW ADMINISTRATION  STARTING. >> WHAT? OH, THAT'S RIGHT. >> YES. YOU KNOW, ESSENTIALLY, WE  REVERSED THAT RALLY OVER 23  TRADING DAYS AND NOW WE'VE GIVEN UP 5% AND ANOTHER 2% WOULD ON  ROUND TRIP US. >> 23 TRADING DAYS.  >> YES. >> DO YOU THINK STOCKS LOOK  EXPENSIVE HERE OR NOT? WE'VE COME BACK DOWN AS YOU  MENTIONED. PEOPLE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE PE RATIO AND HOW IT IS HISTORICALLY AT THE HIGH END OF THINGS. DO YOU THINK WE HAVE THE  EARNINGS POWER TO SUPPORT ALL OF THAT? >> TO ME, THE TEN-YEAR EVEN IF  IT GETS TO 5%, IS A 20 PE  MULTIPLE ON A TEN-YEAR BOND. THE MEDIAN PE IS 17 TIMES. I THINK STOCKS ARING GIVING YOU  MUCH BETTER VALUE THAN A BOND  RIGHT NOW AND 5% IS PROBABLY NOT THE LEVEL THAT YIELDS STAY. IT IS PROBABLY A DEFLECTION  POINT.  >> TOM, WHAT IS THE MOVEMENT IN  BITCOIN? IS THAT A SIGNAL OR A SIGN IN  ANY OF THIS ANALYSIS? >> STUPID FED. NOT CUTTING. >> BITCOIN IS DOWN ROUGHLY 15%  FROM ITS HIGHS WHICH FOR A HYPER VOLATILE ASSET IS A NORMAL  CORRECTION AND FOLLOWING GLOBAL  LIQUIDITY. WE ARE EARLY IN THE HALVING  CYCLE. OUR TECHNICIAN THINKS 70,000 IS  WHERE WE MAKE A STAND. I THINK BITCOIN IS ONE OF THE  BEST PERFORMING. >> YOU THINK IT GOES DOWN TO  70,000 OR DO YOU THINK THAT'S  THE FLOOR IN WHICH CASE YOU  WOULD BUY AT THIS PRICE? >> ONE LEVEL WOULD BE 70. >> SAY THAT AGAIN? >> RETRACEMENT LEVEL. YOU PULL BACK FROM WHERE YOU  RALLY. 70 IS ONE LEVEL. IT COULD GO AS LOW AS THE 50s. BUT THAT'S AGAIN NOT A NEW  LEVEL. THAT'S WHERE IT TOUCHES BEFORE  IT BEGINS TO RALLY.  >> LET ME ASK YOU A DIFFERENT  QUESTION. FOR THOSE WATCHING NOT IN  BITCOIN ON THINKING OF BUYING  BITCOIN AT THESE PRICES, ARE YOU SAYING THIS IS A FAIR PRICE TO  GET IN OR ARE YOU SAYING WAIT  BECAUSE YOU FEEL IT IS GETTING  FARTHER DOWN? >> BITCOIN IS SOMETHING YOU NEED TO BELONG- LONG-TERM FOCUSED. IF THEY ARE TRYING TO TIME THIS, MAYBE THEY GET LUCKY AND IT GOES TO 70.",

JOINING US NOW IS SERHANT  FOUNDER CEO AND BROKER RYAN  SERHANT. GOOD TO SEE YOU. SO, INVENTORY HAS BEEN A MAJOR ISSUE FOR A WHILE. KEEPING PRICES HIGHER, YOU EXPECT A BOOST IN INVENTORY AS SELLERS GET USED TO RATES THIS YEAR BUT WHAT MIGHT, IF ANYTHING, CAUSE INVENTORY TO BE HIGHER THAN YOU EXPECT TO THE POINT WHERE IT MIGHT PRESSURE PRICES >> WELL, INVENTORY IS ALREADY  INCREASED. I THINK WE'RE SEEING TOTAL SUPPLY AT ABOUT 10% HIGHER YEAR  OVER YEAR. AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, WE JUST EXPERIENCED BACK-TO-BACK  YEARS OF THE SLOWEST SALES MARKET FOR RESIDENTIAL HOUSING IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE MID'90s. I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS FOR HOUSING I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD EXPECT THAT LONG-TERM MORTGAGE RATES ARE GOING TO BE BETWEEN 6% AND 7% EVEN THOUGH SHORT-TERM  RATES WILL CONTINUE TO COME DOWN AND I EXPECT SALES TO PICK UP  DUE TO PENT-UP DEMAND THAT WE  HAD SITTING ON THE SIDELINES FOR THE PAST COUPLE YEARS AS BOTH  BUYERS AND SELLERS, EXCEPT WHERE RATES ARE ACCEPT THE NEW ORMAL AND WE HAVE TO MOVE.

IF ANYTHING IT HAS BECOME MORE TRANSPARENT, WHICH IS SOMETHING  THAT MYSELF AND OUR FIRMS HAVE ALWAYS PUSHED FOR, THAT YOU HAVE CLEAR COMMUNICATION WITH YOUR  CLIENTS, WHETHER YOU'RE HELPING  THEM ON THE BUY SIDE OR ON THE SELL SIDE. IF ANYTHING, MORE HOMES WILL BE  SOLD AS MORE PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT THE PROCESS IN WHICH THEY  PURCHASE THAT HOME THE AGENT, THOUGH, AS YOU THINK  ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS, RIGHT, THEIR COMMISSIONED, THEY'RE NOT  SALARIED, THEY LIVE AND DIE BY SELLING THIS HOME OR THAT HOME IF YOU SIGN A CONTRACT TO BUY A  HOME THAT CLOSES TOMORROW AND  THERE IS A COMMISSION AGREEMENT  THAT IS SIGNED ON A BUY SIDE OR  SELL SIDE, THAT'S HOW THEY'RE  COMPENSATED. IF IT CLOSES IN A YEAR, YOU  THINK ABOUT THE NEW CONSTRUCTION HOMES, THE TOWERS THAT WE SELL IN NEW YORK CITY, SOUTH FLORIDA, ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, SOMETIMES  YOU DO YOUR WORK AS A REAL ESTATE AGENT, YOU WORK 15 HOURS  A DAY, YOU DON'T ACTUALLY GET  PAID FOR THAT WORK, UNTIL IT CLOSES SIX MONTHS  ER FROM  YEAR FROM NOW OR SO.

            "Some potential merger news in  the energy sector. Reports say constellation energy is in advanced talks to acquire  calpine for $30 billion. Natural gas prices are popping again as cold weather grips the  eastern u.s. Investors weighing uncertainty and energy production after  president-elect trump promised to do away with the biden  administration's offshore oil  and gas development ban. Joining us now is bill perkins it is great to have you on happy new year man -- >> great to be back. >> nat gas has been ripping. >> we finally got some cold  weather. The producer showed some discipline cutting back supplies and we didn't get into a containment situation until  november, where there was warm weather. With the cold weather, that  really means a lot to producers, not just for winter pricing, but for the entire injection season. That makes a lot more space for  gas to go into the ground, so  we're less worried about prices  dropping precipitously that should improve their cash flows and their ability to grow  production into the year.  >> okay. How much of this now hinges on weather and that draw down on  supply that is in storage. How much of this is tied to  policies with a new  administration coming in and potentially more lng exports as  in europe we're seeing some  changes with ukraine, russia,  lng deal going away? >> in the short-term and intermediate term it is all  about the weather. Market has been chopping around  with each run of the weather models it has been pretty exciting in the front. A little bit longer term, policy starts to matter, infrastructure starts to matter the facilities are ramping up, whether they ramp up on time or  early. We're hearing reports of plaquemines facility two months  earlier than expected. That adds to the demand picture. And you mentioned about calpine  being bought by constellation, that's all on the a.i. Data  driven demand that is out there. Electricity demand is  skyrocketing much more bullish than anticipated 12 months ago,  six months ago it seems insatiable right now. And so people are looking to take advantage of that so longer term policy  infrastructure matters more. >> yeah, bill, talk to me about  policy president-elect trump has been promising to boost energy supply as a way to reduce inflation is that a threat to energy prices how do you factor it in? >> well, i mean, if you remove the barrier tax on federal lands, speed up permitting, a  lot of it is just delay with permitting reform on federal lands and longer term, producers will respond to that and have  much more supply that will be bearish signal for  longer term prices it takes quite a bit to ramp up  a program, a drilling program, so i wouldn't expect that to affect things in the coming  year, but perhaps '26, '27, '28  we can see a slightly more robust supply picture. >> and now what about m&a? a lot of industries getting  excited about the prospects of the limits coming off on that in energy besides this calpine  thing we're hearing about today. Should we expect more of that? >> yeah, especially the permian. There is some good producers there, great acreage, efficiency of drilling is going up. And access to the market, we're  seeing new pipelines come out of there that are removing  bottlenecks. There is a macro story of  electricity demand going on that is going to play out over  several years unless that bursts somehow. And so i would expect some of  the larger players to look for strategic acquisitions in the  electricity side, generation side and also on the fuel  production side. >> how important is nat gas  going to be as this bridge builds toward nuclear, other alternative and sustainable  energy sources that have been  talked about, but haven't been realized in a meaningful way yet? >> yeah, i think it is going to  be very important. It has been very important our missions in terms of co2 or  particulate or any type of pollution per megawatt generated on an absolute level have gone largely in part of because of  the efficiency of natural gas  generation and lower polluting of natural gas we pretty much destroyed the amount of coal burned in this  country and it has done  wonderful things for people's  life expectancy and health and clean air. And so we have this abundant resource called natural gas here in the united states of america, loosenin",

            "So this is a new ceo being named as of liberty media. Back over to you.  >> julia boorstin, thank you.  >>> treasury yields capturing  plenty of attention on wall  street lately. The ten-year yield touching its  highest level since april  earlier today. Our next guest says the rise in  yields could be a false flag let's bring in fundstrats head of research tom lee, also a cnbc contributor. Tom, good to see you let's start there with the yield impact what might be people be reading  wrong, do you think? >> well, i wouldn't say markets  are necessarily reading it wrong, but i would say as  uncomfortable as we are seeing yields at near one-year highs, i don't think that this is going to be the level we see a few months from now and i think  that's more important because  ultimately if yields begin to  fall, because inflation  pressures are easing or if the job market is a bit softer than  expected, it really puts the fed put back in focus. So, i guess what i would just  say is it is not comfortable to  be here where yields are, i  don't think it really breaks markets, but i don't think yields are necessarily moving  higher over the next few months. >> well, it is particularly  uncomfortable, arguably, for small caps early last year probably around  this time you made a bold call on how much small caps could rise you moderated from that since. But where do you see small caps  going now? why didn't the big pop that you  projected for '24 pan out? >> yes, small caps have been disappointing. I mean, unfortunately i think  there has been a rug pull on those names a few times. I think investors are going to be very wary but to us, i think  the road map for 2025 is still one where the opportunity for  stocks to have much better breadth widens because not only  do we have an income administration that is pro business and i think it is going to boost ceo confidence, it is pretty evident now even seeing it in both ism readings  recently, but that's going to be a better environment for mergers, so, to me, while small  caps have been big laggards, actually for the last ten years, this ten-year underperformance to the the s&p is the worst in almost 100 years so second only to 1998 and then from a valuation  perspective, small caps are  still much more attractive, the  median pe is around 11 times,  that's seven turns cheaper than  the s&p. So, it has been tough, jon, to be overweight small caps, but i  think they're going to work in 2025 >> okay. I want to get your thoughts on some of the riskier assets or  the riskier parts of the market  that are -- i'll use the word  maybe potentially more speculative. Case in point, the quantum computing stocks, they had a huge move higher jensen huang from nvidia comes out yesterday, makes comments  saying that, you know, some of the super computers are still  and the full i guess realization of super computers is still  decades away and you see all the stocks tumble there is one that you like in  your granny shots here i believe ion q. Want to get your thoughts on what we have seen and some of  these parts of the market and  how to think about investing, if you should be investing in some  of these more speculative or futuristic frontier tech-like  companies. >> i think investors do need to  put a long-term lens on a lot of these important megathemes i think quantum computing is in  the earliest days. I don't think anyone can judge really whether it is 15 years  away or 15 months. And i think people have made many mistakes over the past 20 years looking at things like social media and underestimating the adoption rates there or  internet or even a.i. Now. Just think about two years ago how many people were saying a.i. Was going to actually take far longer than expected that being said, i do think the  environment for stock hasn't been great for the last three  weeks. I think it has gotten people into a recency bias thinking we  are near the top or stocks are just awful now i think we're getting close to the point where you should be  betting really and leaning heavily against that even look at a.i. Sentiment, it  is almost back to negative but, morgan, regarding quantum specifically, it is ",

            "For investors. >> energy trader bill perkins  joins us with his take on the  big swings for natural gas and how frigid weather, trump energy policy and geopolitics are impacting the commodities  markets. First to today's market action with courtney garcia and daniel  skelly it is great to have you both here, especially as we did have  the s&p basically eek out a  gain, though barely. More situation for the dow and the nasdaq but, courtney, just in terms of  how important yields are to the  equity picture, is that really what is driving things right now or is this a situation where there is a lot of sitting on your hands and waiting earnings  and other key catalysts like jobs later this week >> it is probably a little of  both when looking at the markets, especially today, a lot of that  is due to what is happening with the treasury and and inflation   going to continue to be a  headline that we're looking for. It did come off some of the  highs. You're seeing the markets have kind of recovered as the treasury has come down but really what the bond markets are continuing to tell you is  that inflation is likely going to be an issue you're going to start to see this peak in, goods deflation is slowing and you're starting it see inklings of inflation  continuing to peek its head here and that's where the markets are trying to see where the things are going because if interest  rates keep flying and inflation  is a problem, that is going to continue to be a problem in  2025.  >> you talked about this idea of a goldilocks view. You've written about widening  tail risks so, where do you see those risks and how do you prepare for them? >> sure, morgan, we're looking at a bit of a paradox this year  within markets in terms of an  unstoppable force, which is the  idea of u.s. Exceptionalism that everyone wants to invest here  and we got some of the leading secular themes meeting an  unstoppable object of u.s. Valuations and potential earnings and interest rate and inflation challenges and so the net effect of that  paradox is just a choppier first half to this year. And so as you were talking about earlier, we need to see more clarity on earnings expectations being met or exceeded and more information around the nature of tariffs, universal or select and what is the sequencing of  tariffs vis-a-vis the policy regulations. >> you say investors can buy cheaper valuations than the  megacaps, than the mag 7 with  high earnings growth you say you see opportunities in europe talk to me about how to approach europe when as dan mentioned there is a lot of focus on the u.s. Economy, on u.s. Stocks as  being attractive what kind of value do you see in europe >> yeah, and don't get me wrong  here, we absolutely still want to own the u.s and the question is the  magnificent 7 going to continue  to lead with the same kind of  outperformance it has been that's where i'm not sure it is. We're going to continue to own those things but those things are done really well, it is a good time to take  some profits, bring it back to your target. That's where with the profits  what areas do you want to look at that's where you look at things  like industrials, materials, both had negative to flat  earnings growth in 2024. Look at 2025, the earnings growth expectations are expected to be upwards of 18% and obviously much cheaper than  those mag 7. That's where taking some of the  extra money, putting it there  can be an opportunity. And europe also is significantly cheaper than the u.s., trades 13 times versus 22 times here in  the u.s. But the energy specifically in europe is even more dramatic,  about 50% discount to u.s. Shell, for example, trades about 8 times forward earnings or  exxon is like 14 tim",

WE WON'T GET ANY MORE SUBSTANCE  FROM THAT UNTIL THIS YEAR'S  WWDC.  THAT IS A KEY EVENT FOR THEM.  >> SO WE HAVE TO WAIT AGAIN. YOU ARE NOT COUNTING ON AN UPGRADE CYCLE. RATHER THAN ONE BIG EVENT, IT  JUST BECOMES THIS ROLLING DEAL THAT WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH?  IT WILL JUST TAKE YOU LONGER TO  GET TO THE DESTINATION YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE.  >> I THINK THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT. THE BAR IS LOW BUT I ALSO THINK  THAT APPLE, EVEN IF THEY DON'T GET THE A.I. TAILWIND, THEY HAVE EASY COMPS.  THEY HAVE DONE ENOUGH WITH A.I.  AND OTHER UPGRADES TO THE  iPHONE 16 THAT THEY CAN BEAT THAT LOW BAR.  THE QUESTION IN MY MIND, WHEN  GETTING EXCITED ABOUT APPLE IS,  WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE FOR NEXT  YEAR?  CAN THEY EXCEED AND GET BACK INTO THAT STRONG DOUBLE-DIGIT  KIND OF GROWTH?  WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT IN A LONG  TIME.  THE PEOPLE HOPE THEY CAN ACCELERATE TOO.  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WILL BE  THAT CAN DRIVE THAT KIND OF  GROWTH UNTIL LATER THIS YEAR.  >> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS BACK UP IN RATES IN GENERAL? ARE YOU CONCERNED IT WILL  DERAIL WHAT WILL BE A PRETTY GOOD MARKET HEADING INTO THIS  YEAR?  >> WE USE A.I. AND INTELLIGENT ALPHA TO MAKE  PREDICTIONS ABOUT HE MARKET. ONE OF OUR PREDICTIONS OF OUR  TRIO THAT WE USE PREDICTED THAT  THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR WOULD  HAVE A 10% LABOR OF CORRECTION.  WHAT IS SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT  WAS THAT WE MAY HAVE A RECURRENCE OF INFLATION AND  THAT MAY RESULT IN SOMETHING THAT MAYBE LOOKS LIKE WHAT WE  ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW WITH  RATES BECOMING MORE STABLE,  MAYBE EVEN RISING A LITTLE BIT.  I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF WE DO EVENTUALLY GET SOME SORT OF MARKET CORRECTION DRIVEN BY A  NARRATIVE AROUND RATES AND INFLATION BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE MARKET HAS BEEN SENSITIVE  TO FOR THE LAST TW",

            "Am definitely having shell shock from these high egg  prices and copy prices too.  we will have to hatch a plan for breakfast. Okay, i am done. >> very clever.  as always, kristina  partsinevelos, thank you.  >> kevin simpson is back.  he is the cio and founder of capital wealth planning. We think we have figure this all out. Let's try this again.  nvidia, you did what the other day? >> yesterday, scott, we tried  to harvest to the volatility that we saw in the free market.  we wrote a call expiring this  friday.  for three days, the option brought in one dollar per  share. It is a $147 strike. It gives us a little bit of  upside.  if you annualize out the premium, this is a fun thing to  look at. It is 60% annualized premium.  when you have markets like this  that are volatile, that are  shocking, to your point, we  will not sit on our hands and  we will try to harvest the volatility.  we have seven dollars to the upside and two days left in the  option.  >> j.p.  morgan trade was what? >> a little bit more boring. This one expires in two weeks. Is is our dividend strategy. The stock bottomed out around  230 in mid december and it has come up around 242.  we have $12 of upside potential  over the next two weeks but it brought in $1.10 and when you  annualize that out, it comes up  to an 8% annualized premium and  that is what we look for in our  main strategy. The nvidia trade is super fun  to look at but if you look at  these blue-chip companies and  you can generate an extra 5% or  6% a year in option premium, it  can really help, especially in a year like 2025 where things  might just not automatically go  to the moon again. >> what did you do with robin  hood?  >> this is in our growth strategy also. This was a final trade on  friday with the halftime report.  this is a stock that started off with the pandemic as a meme  trading thing. Cryptocurrencies, things like  that.  they are really maturing and they are looking at the long term plan in wealth management.  they recently bought a firm  called trade pmr which services  the custodian shift.

            "Performance. If they take the necessary steps to get it, thanks for  talking. Rapidly rising rates and the future of this rally.  let's bring in cnbc  steve lee smith and bryn.  i will go to you first.  big of a story is this now for the market?  >> i don't think it will be a  big story three months from  now. I think maybe we move a little bit higher.  we have seen these numbers before.  we saw them in 2024 where we almost touched 5%. I think we will get a settling out after the inauguration.  we have some more understanding  around the policies and what actually will happen or the  potential to happened but i  think the bond vigilantes are  sniffing out.  the economy is strong. We have lots of unknowns from  the new administration that  seems on the surface to be inflationary.  as we get rates to be higher,  it will be a great opportunity.  i don't think they will be there by the end of the year.  >> the problem, steve, is not  so much the level, it is not that we did not think we would be at this level when the fed  started cutting rates in september. I am wondering how much you  think the fed itself has been  caught a bit off guard by all  of this. >> i think they weren't  expecting this.  i would have expected, scott,  that the improvement that we saw from april through september, maybe we had  overdone it a little bit but right now, we have round tripped that.  if you look at the 10 year over  that period of time, it is interesting that the stocks  have remained buoyant from that  pressure and i think it does shift the risk around a bit  which is this notion that we thought we were out of the woods on that refinancing thing  because rates have come down but there is a lot of debt that  will be rolling over from the  pandemic.  i think i have to go back and  look at those charts again to  see if that is an issue that is  worth exploring in terms of  risk to the system out there.  people thought they would refi and that gets to the heart of  your question. People thought they would refi lower rates and now they will  refi at the same rate they were  at before. >> bryn, you make an interesting point that you think this soon will pass. Three months from now, this  will not be a problem. To steve's point,  a.b.  stocks have not completely fallen out of bed because it presumably what you think is the reason that this will all  be okay. A lot of optimism about what this will bring. >> on steve's point about  refinancing, i think around 20%  of our debt, that is the market.  the fed cannot control the market.  as it relates to refinancing,  that might be a slight positive  because the rates have come  down on the lower end. I do think that your assessment  about right now, the market is getting the benefit of the doubt that rates won't stay at this level but for certain sectors like for small caps, everyone was so bullish. If rates stay at this level, i don't think we will see the  traders moving into those small- cap names as more interest rate  sensitive names. I still say stay at the cap  structure if you are going to  do a broad-based pla",

            ">>> welcome back.  it's time for today's three- stock lunch, and here with our trades, mr. Michael farr.  chief market strategist at hightower adviser, and of  course, a cnbc contributor.  first, chevron.  we heard a little bit from the ceo earlier today. The entire interview is at cnbc.com/pro,  and michael, you  say to buy chevron?  >> i say buy chevron.  thanks for having me, and  congratulations on this great  show.  kelly, this is awesome.  yeah, chevron's great and it's a must-see interview on  cnbc.com.  you've got to watch it.  this is a 4.35% dividend, it is  a fabulous balance sheet.  oil is sort of stilts hello -- still below its normal range.  anywhere around this 2.5% to 3%  for 2025, i think these oil  companies are a safe dividend  play.  it will be pretty good.  >> we don't have a lot of time,  but let's mention at&t, which  had a nice year last year. Do you like it?  >> no. It's okay, kelly.  i mean, at&t is fine.  so, how do you buy it now? you love the dividend. It's been great. At&t is a stalwart.  i don't have a problem with it.  as a whole, i can kind of do it, but i can't see where they will  come up with big growth for  this year. >> it's only up 20% on the year  anyways. >> compared to palantir, the hottest stock. 340% gain. It's down a couple of percent  this year. What do we do with palantir, michael? >> okay. If you all promise not to tell anybody, i bought the stock in may. Just between us. I bought it in may, and my personal account, because my brilliant son robert said, dad,  i like the stock, you should buy some.  i did not buy enough, needless to say.  i tripled my money in six  months.  i have sold 80% of my position,  maybe more.  it's about tha",

            "Demand that and will pull the  stock up like it has the past  two years. >> we watch all of that. Bryn, thank you. That was bryn talkington.  we will go to the broader  market now.  the doubt  is positive, albeit barely.  kevin gordon of charles schwab joins me now.  nice to see you. >> what is your read on all of this as you have listened to our conversation?  >> i love weprin was just  talking about in terms of when you get stretch valuations and you get hot sentiment and then it flips on the switch.  it can send a name or an industry or stocks in other  directions and that brings me  to a theme we have had for a couple of quarters now,  especially heading into 2025 where when you look at sentiment environment and 24, a  lot of the etrics that we  track were stuck in extreme  optimism territory for a big chunk of the year. You only had a few eriods  where it was early april to  late april in the midsummer  drawdown where some of that got  washed out and then it came  back very quickly. The environment and the ground is a little bit shakier heading  into this year because you had gone through a really long stretch of it being in extreme optimism territory.  it is not a reason in and of itself for stocks to sell up automatically but when you have  that shaky foundation and you  have a little more vulnerability, it opens you up to more of a draw down when you  have a negative catalyst.  >> do you feel like you are on the precipice of a narrative switch, of a sentiment change? as we also discussed with bryn and  steve liesman to start the  show, there is optimism about  what will happen despite some  of the concerns about  sticky  inflation and escalating deficit. >> the problem is you have these cross prints.  from a policy standpoint you have less change in regulation,  maybe a rollback and regulation, something that is  more beneficial from a tax policy standpoint but there is also a tiding mismatch because you have a regularly aggressive  tariff policy and you have a relatively aggressive  immigration policy that is being proposed.  it is human nature to look at  all of these proposals and take  them at once and say, here is  the ultimate it will happen but  we know that is not the case.  that is the benefit for  investors and probably the benefit for the economy for  most of this year if not all of  this year where if you exclude tariffs, everything from an  immigration standpoint takes a longer time to implement especially for taxes.  that is not something that the president can do unilaterally. That is why we are focusing a  lot more on what could happen  from a tariffs standpoint and  from an immigration standpoint but probably tariffs gives you that first hit and then  immigration falls under. You have to look at the suit can sing and what the result is  and from a growth standpoint --  maybe it is a little bit more  of a contrarian view but i think that the risk is more on the growth side, not as much on  the inflation side unless you  get significant retaliation  from other countries and you go  into a full-blown trade war. The tariff increase itself is  more of a one time price increase.  i would look from a cap x  standpoint and see if that materially slows and takes a hit. >> investors are a little  spooked by the move in rates.  are you? >> not as much.  right now, it is consistent  with a relatively healthy  growth backdrop. It is not like we have seen  some fall in estimates for gdp growth heading into this year  or even at the end of last year.  if you have for some reason the  material weakening in the labor  markets, friday's jobs reports are really weak and then you have some heat from cpi and  therefore cpe, i would grow  more concerned.  one of the reasons that you  haven't seen as steep of a selloff even as the rate of  change in something like the 10  year has really picked  up and you are getting closer to 4.7  and breaking closer to 5%, one of the reasons is that because the growth backdrop is relatively sparse. >> you have to keep in mind  too, if you take a longer look at the 10 year, in the sense of  the last three to four years,  you have gone through these  spouts, most notably the july  to october 2023 period where the 10 year did get up to 3% for a hot second and then a  reversed.  when you get to that point, you  have significant pullback in the market.  over that time, we have been able to move higher, not without a lo",

            "According to the federal reserve, guys, and this is why they have telegraphed they will  be slowing the pace of easing  in the coming year.  >> steve, stick around.  for more reaction to the fed minutes, the interest rate, the  macro economic environment,  let's bring in seth carpenter, chief global economist at  morgan stanley.  your take on the headlines that  steve gave.  >> unsurprisingly, steve did a great job. Look, i think the facts are  clear. The u.s. Economy is still on pretty solid footing.  the labor market had cooled, but was by no means cold, and  inflation keeps coming down, but there is noise, and there  are lots of ratings in recent  months that gave some of the members of the committee pause.  what is the central bank to do after you have cut interest  rates a lot and you don't know what the neutral rate is?  they ask themselves, how much  further do we have to go, and  they are inclined to keep going. We just heard on the wire, a speech from chris waller.  they are inclined to keep  cutting rates, they just don't want to overdo it. They are doing this balancing  act, and the fact they are getting closer to where they need to be, it is showing  through in this dispersion of  use, and just how much faster  and further they have to go. >> well, answer your own question, because i think it's confusing to a lot of people and by a lot of people -- i'm  referring to myself. In september, the federal  reserve cut rates by a half a  percentage point, 50 basis points, and we have been talking about the pace of rate cuts from the end of last year and all of this year, and all  the bond market has done is  react in the exact opposite  way, and bond yields continue  to spike, so i think the technical term is, somebody  screwed up.  >> i want to be a little bit more sympathetic to the really difficult job that jay powell  and his colleagues have. They are reading the data  coming in in real time.  they are inferring from the  real-time data what they have  to do. We were a little bit surprised by the 50 basis point cut, the soft readings in the labor market.  we thought, at the time, or  exaggerating what was going on,  but the fed did not want to  take any chances at that point,  and as they were just starting to lower interest rates, they  knew they were further away  from neutral.  if you are going to make a bit of a mistake, that would be the  time to, perhaps, cut a little bit more, so i think they were doing risk management. One of the paragraphs in the minutes that just came out was all about the risk management  discussions. Now, they are reading the  incoming data and asking, how  far do we have to go?  our view is, probably two more rate cuts this year. The economy will slow, but not crash for a while. There is huge uncertainty, though, about what will happen with tariff policy, as steve alluded to, what is going to happen with immigration policy,  as well? all of that uncertainty means  they can't be confident in how far they have to go. >> i guess, steve, the point is, there were a lot of people hoping that rates would go down  so they can afford a mortgage  to buy a home, and they heard  rate cuts, and they probably automatically assumed that rates would go down, and they  did go down, by the way. Maybe, they did something in september, but if they didn't, you thought, i will wait and rates will keep going down, but  they have not gone down. Is there anything you have seen, or somebody you talked to, that can explain why the fed is cutting while bond  yields are soaring?  >> brian, that's a great question.  reading these minutes, the 23  minutes that we get to read them , i was struck by the idea that  this did not, generally, read  like the set of minutes from a meeting where you would cut  interest rates.  unless, you are good, darn sure  that you are above the neutral rate and restrictive.  there were parts of this thing that you could read, like two  thirds of it, that would read  like the kind of minutes for a meeting, where they either held  the policy rate the same, or even raised the policy rate. It was a very unusual situation  when you look at the discussion  about the possibility of inflation stalling, when you look at the uncertainty around fiscal policy that is coming from trade and immigration.  you are right in the sense that  the rate cut was a little  unexpected by some people, and then you have people in the  room there.  we got some of that when we  look at the dock bought, as  well, but there was more than  one person in the room but did not want to hike rates.  not everybody got the vote, and  there may be some people that  voted for the rate cut, that did not think it was the best  course of action, may have gone  a long with the majority on  that, but you are right in the sense that we thought rates  were going to go down. If you look at that chart of the 10 years since september,  they have gone straight back up,  but the key here that i think is important for the fed and maybe seth wants to comment  on thi",

WHY ARE STOCKS SHRUGGING OFF THESE MOVING RATES?  >> I THINK WE HAVE TO FACTOR IN, WHY ARE YIELDS GOING HIGHER?  THE DRAWING ON THE BOARD DEMONSTRATED CERTAIN PERIODS OF  TIME WHERE YIELDS WERE GOING UP  OR DOWN BASED ON EXPECTATIONS  OR FED POLICY, OR BASED ON INFLATIONARY PRESSURES.  THAT WILL HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON STOCKS.  MOST RECENTLY, YIELDS HAVE BEEN  GOING UP BASED ON GROWTH EXPECTATIONS.  IF YIELDS ARE RISING BASED ON  GROWTH EXPECTATIONS, WE CAN GET  MORE COMFORTABLE AROUND  EARNINGS GROWTH. THAT IS POSITIVE FOR STOCKS. IF YIELDS ARE GOING UP BECAUSE OF DEFICIT CONCERNS, OR BECAUSE  OF INFLATIONARY CONCERNS, YOU  ARE GOING TO SEE STOCKS FALL.  REALLY, IT'S A FUNCTION OF WHAT  IS DRIVING YIELDS, HOWEVER, I  WOULD SAY THAT OVER TIME, LOWER  YIELDS FAVOR THE EQUITY  MARKETS, PARTICULARLY, LONGER  DURATION EQUITIES LIKE THESE MEGA CAP TECH NAMES. THAT IS SOMETHING WE WILL HAVE TO GET USED TO.  WE WILL HAVE TO GET PREPARED FOR HIRE, LONGER-TERM RATES, HIGHER RATES ACROSS THE CURVE  AS RATES CONTINUE TO NORMALIZE.  >> JEFF, I LIKE THE STORY OF YIELDS RISING FOR GOOD REASONS,  AND IT HAPPENED IN THE LATE  1990s, BY THE WAY, BUT THE ONLY  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN  IS WE HAVE HUGE DEFICITS AND A BIG DEBT PILE. WHEN YIELDS ARE HANGING OUT AT 5% OR 6%, INTEREST COSTS ARE GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PAYMENTS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP HAVING  DEFICITS, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP HAVING A GROWING DEBT PILE, SO WE CAN BE AS COMFORTABLE WITH  IT NOW AS WE WERE BACK THEN  >> I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT,  KELLY. DAVID LAID OUT THE NARRATIVE.  HE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.  YOU CAN SEE EQUITIES MOVE  HIGHER WITH HIGHER YIELDS, IS  THAT THE STRONG ECONOMY. THAT WAS THE NARRATIVE IN 2024.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE LECTION  RESULT, PEOPLE GOT REALLY  EXCITED. NOW, AT 4.73 ON THE 10 YEAR, FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU SAW IT IN THE MINUTES, THE MARKETS ARE  QUESTIONING, WAS THE FED RIGHT IN CUTTING?  YOU WENT BACK TO SEPTEMBER,  THEY CUT 100 BASIS POINTS, AND THE 10 YEAR NOTE IS UP OVER 100  BASIS POINTS.  AS THE FED IS SNIVELING TODAY, YOU ARE SEEING SKITTISHNESS, CONFUSION. LOOK AT THE S&P 500. WE HAVE SEEN THE S&P 500 GO  POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, OVER A DOZEN TIMES. THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP, LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION.  FOR THE FIRST TIME, AS WE GET  CLOSER TO THIS 5% LEVEL ON THE 10 YEAR, PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING  MASSIVE PROFIT-TAKING OR REBALANCING, BECAUSE 2023 AND  2024 WERE HISTORIC EQUITY GAINS  BACK TO BACK.  AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME, IT SEEMS LIKE THE 10 YEAR NOTE MAY  GO TO 5%, AND THAT WILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN ACUTE REACTION  TO THESE HIGH FLYERS OR TOP 10 HOLDINGS ON THE S&P 500, WHICH YOU CAN EASILY ARGUE OUR WAY OVER CONCENTRATED. >> DAVID, WHAT WOULD OU SAY TO THAT?  >> I AGREE.  I THINK SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO  FACTOR IN, WHAT DO HIGHER RATES  MEAN FOR THE EQUITY MARKET?  I THINK THE PROBLEM TODAY IS THAT SOMEBODY PEOPLE ARE YEARNING FOR THE ULTRA LOW RATE  ENVIRONMENT WE SAW IN THE LAST CYCLE. BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT TO GO BACK TO THAT ULTRA  LOW RATE ENVIRONMENT MEANS THE ECONOMY HAS TO COLLAPSE. WE DON'T WANT THAT.  WHAT WE WANT IS NORMAL.  IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN  OVERNIGHT SENSATION WHERE  PEOPLE WAKE UP AND SAY, OKAY,  I'M OKAY WITH A 5% TREASURY  YIELD, I STILL WANT TO OWN EQUITIES.  YOU WILL SEE ALLOCATIONS INTO  BONDS AND MONEY MARKETS AS THESE THINGS HAPPEN, BUT OVER  TIME, THE NORMALIZATION OF RATES MAKES PERFECT SENSE. IT MAY SKEW YOUR PORTFOLIO A LITTLE BIT. ",

            "Assess.  lack of regulatory oversight is  among them.  j.p. Morgan has $10 billion set aside , drop in the bucket for them  to compete in private deals. Let's bring in to see how ceo  of blue owl capital. It is great to have you here,  mark.  welcome. >> terrific to be here.  thank you for having me. I'm sorry about the context of the tragic fires and we have partners and lots of players with them. Thank you for having me here.  >> appreciate that, of course. A lot of the real estate developers that we talked to, a  lot of them say that they are  turning to private credit for  financing. >> one of the megatrends, if we  want to use that word is the migration of more traditional  asset markets into the private markets. You are hitting on one of the  core themes that we see this year going forward.  we have one of the best in the business and lending.  the kind of lending you are  talking about properties and residential packages is exactly  what it provides.  i think direct lending is that we will see a similar migration  from those public markets into private markets offering large cap durable solutions. >> as you know, it goes where  it needs to. At some point, if people can't get a loan, it will turn to  private credit and say, at least this is an option. They have to hold capital. What about the private credit  world? >> we all focus entirely on  credit management. The key for us is that we have long-duration capital and we use very little leverage.  thankfully, we have been able  to originate over $100 billion of loans and have a 10 basis point realize loss basis rate. We have losses that sound more like ig losses.  however you will, the bottom line is unlike a bank, our money is locked up.  unlike a bank, we don't use  much leverage. Most importantly, we don't have  any depositors.  there is nobody standing behind  us.  this is private capital taking on a well-managed risk in the  hands of a professional  investor like blue owl appeared  as one of the banks in the financial ecosystem. They are complementary, but  structures are very different. >> that's interesting and we did learn from long-term capital management that if you are systemically important and i'm not saying that blue owl is  lt cm, but interns in terms of size, -- that's all i'm saying.  the other dynamic i'm thinking about a lot is interest rates. The higher rates are, the  better investors will do, but  can the companies afforded?  a lot of it is floating dead?  >> it is.  higher for longer environment, which has been what we have  anticipated candidly for the last 18 months and it's clearly  the consensus as a directional matter is very good for our  investors. You phrased the right question.  it's very good.  there is a level of interest bills and burden.  they are too troubling for them  to carry.  we stress tested that. The thing about private credit as we run a lot of years through a lot of different environments through covid, the  bank meltdowns, silicon valley bank, high rates and we have well over five and we tested the statements as the owners of  these businesses.  the great news is that it  works. They are durable to any current  rate levels or realistic bands around them. Surely, there is a version of  hyperinflation and rates that  would not be manageable, but i don't think we have a realistic  expectation. >> the growth speaks for itself. I am waiting for the big talks.  you know what's coming.  maybe not in the next couple of  years, but at some point you know it's coming.  >> we understand that and we know that it's transparent.  any regulator and the key point  is that we have capital that is  from a private group with  another private user and committed in much term to its  use. We really provide a stabilizing  force and not trying to  overstate this in a societal setting, but it's better to  maturation and risk and put it with private lenders.  >> like any new thing, the",

              "Microsoft said that google developed the quantum chip and it shares up more than 560% in three months and it is dead  wrong. That brings us to today's tech check. >>> joined by ceo alan baratz. Welcome to both of you.  >> it was google, indeed.  before we get to alan, a little  more context.  it stood at around $200 million  last year and shot up to nearly  $3 million after the breakthrough spurred a surge in  the sector and it's now down 40% on the session.  thank you so much for joining  us and making the time.  tell us what exactly huang, the  leading authority on the future  of computing is getting wrong  here.  >> thank you for the opportunity to be here.  i appreciate it. I think that he is a very smart  individual and has built an  amazing company. He may be the authority with many aspects of computing and  all aspects of computing and certainly not quantum computing. In this case, he's dead wrong. We are commercial today. We have companies like mastercard or pattison group that are using our quantum computers today in production  to benefit business operations.  not 30 years from now or 20  years from now or not 15 years from now, but today. Moreover, we have been able to solve problems on our computer in the area materials  simulation in minutes that would take well over millions  of years to solve on the fastest, which by the way have been massively parallel  computers. They should think a little bit about that.  we are solving problems in minutes and it would take  millions of years to solve them  on massively parallel systems  that he provides.  i would be happy to meet anytime and anyplace to fill in  these gaps.  >> i got the opportunity to get  to know him a little better  over the last month or so. Your  approach is very different than  what huang is talking about.   it's limited to optimization problems and you don't play in the same field. Is that  correct? >> no. When we say we are limited to  optimization, that is not an accurate statement.  we are very good at solving  optimization problems. Frankly, optimization represents most of the important problems that businesses need to solve, so we are proud of the fact  that our computers excel in  that area. That's not the only area we play.  we play materials simulation and we play quantum photography  and cybersecurity. We play in a  broad set of areas.  you are right. We have taken a different  approach from everybody else in  the industry and that is what  has allowed us to become commercial today.  >> what you just described sounds like what generative ai promises to do. Optimization promising relations et cetera. If the wave is offering better,  then why aren't you valued like  a a.i. Company?   why is it contracting in the latest quarter?  >> first of all, with respect  to bookings and revenue, all i will say is that our business  is actually growing nicely.  i am very forward --.  >> was there an exception? revenue was down 27% in your latest quarterly report. What happened? >> as i said, i'm looking  forward to sharing our fiscal  2024 financial and operating results when we report earnings. Stay tuned.  now, that having been said,  a.i. And quantum  are not competitive to one another.  there are some areas where you might be able to use both  systems and i talked about materials simulation, but we are so far ahead of what massively parallel gpu could do  in an area that i don't even do  that as competitive. When it comes to optimization, there are attempts to use it to  solve optimization problems. It's not necessarily their sweet spot and that is an area where i think d-wave  and  quantum computers excel. That is why we are working with  companies today to support their business operations. >> just to be clear, you are saying that it does play in the  same space that jensen is  talking about? i know that there is different approaches to computing and the  gate model.  i don't want to get into that. You are saying that huang  has it all wrong?  >> what i'm saying is that huang  does not understand what  you just said. There are different approaches to quantum. The two primary  approaches.  while his comments may not be  totally off base for model computers, there are 100% off  base for quantum computers.  >> we watched it back. From dead wrong to not totally correct. You walked it back a little bit. >> hold on.  when it comes to quantum computing, it's dead wrong.  we are not 30 years out or 50  years out, but we are today. We are supporting businesses today with quantum computers solve their heart problems.  in that sense, he's dead wrong.  there are approaches to quantum  computing that it will take  longer to mature",

              "Stocks have turned lower.  bond yields are pulling back,  but they were the highest we have seen, kelly, since april. The rate spike causing stocks  to sink. >> as we are saying this, we are back at 471 on the 10 year,  as we get the minutes coming out right now. Steve, do tell.  >> the federal reserve, at its december meeting, was at or  near the point, after cutting  by a quarter, of slowing its policy easing. The rate cut that they did enact was seen as, \"finely balanced.\" it was a finely balanced call, and some wanted to not cut at  all. That is more than just one dissent. Not everybody has the vote.  the minute say that the fed cut  rates to maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market, while continuing progress on inflation, because they believe they were restricted.  the risk between inflation and unemployment were seen as  roughly balanced.  inflation had eased  substantially, the remains somewhat elevated. What you will hear next is a lot of the back-and-forth of the meeting between those most concerned about inflation and  those less concerned.  the pace of the inflation, had slowed, some said. Upside risk to inflation had increased. Several were concerned that  this inflation may have stalled  or risked stalling.  on the other side, some people said this inflation was still  apparent across the board, especially, in market prices,  as opposed to the nonmarket  prices on a range of goods and services.  now, moving on, the firms we are seeing as more reductive to  increase prices, consumers were  more price-sensitive.  changes in trade and immigration policy.  now, a big discussion about  coming fiscal policy, it is  mentioned several times in the minutes. Policy could delay inflation improvement. The uncertainty of elevated -- also elevated the uncertainty  about policy.  there was rising business, optimism, however, and expectations for tax policy  changes, along with the  regulation.  positive market sentiment and  momentum into growth could put upward pressure on inflation,  and the fed was concerned about  knowing the difference between what was a temporary increase  in inflation, but that is the  implicatio",

Appreciate you bringing that to  us.  garrett. >>> has also been impacted by  the fires. He is on the newsline now with more details.  i don't know if you caught some  of that interview, but what is your experience? >> hi, kelly.  i did catch a bit of it. The area is devastated.  it's actually hard to believe, as you can see the images. So many of the homes are wiped out and completely destroyed.  most of the commercial area is gone and the fire went down to the beach. You have homes along  the beach and we have an area  with neighborhoods that are  just gone. The churches and schools are gone. What's amazing to me is  that in this day and age and we  have had record wins and certainly a terrible situation,  but in this day and age, it's  like a third world country and the fires continue to rage on. Last night, the reports that i was getting from my team on the  ground that were with  firefighters, the reports we that the fire hydrants were not  working. There was no water.  can you imagine? >> have you gotten any updated information? is that a major issue or any idea why that would happen?  >> what i was told and what was  reported to me that they mismanaged the reservoir supplying the hydrants and didn't refill it.  when i realized that they had a  problem, they could get it refilled in enough time. You have blocks being on fire  and the firefighters literally had to stand there and watch things burn down. It's beyond  negligence in my opinion.  we've got to get the community rebuild and support the  businesses.  of these homeowners that have  been devastated my daughter  lost her home and my son lost  his home. You get through all  of that, because you have to support the community, but some  tough questions need to be answered about how this happened and the leadership and the void  of leadership. Not just in the last couple of days, but the last couple of years. The public hillsides and mountains have not been managed  with the amount of brush that  created fuel that was just unstoppable and to have the  basic need of water. I just have to throw this out. I don't think this is the time that it should be on a global  trip.  the very basic needs of  leadership is to be present. I think there is real questions  that need to be asked about how  we manage the city and the budget of the fire department  was cut by the city council a  few months ago.  >> we have family and this is  an active situation. They are dealing with power  outages now and a fire spreading now. United said that they will reschedule flights no charge and no problem, but this isn't just about something that  happened last night and is over. >> that's exactly right.

Rates have backed up to all- time highs for the cycle and were 1800 points higher than we  were in october 2023.  >> that's right. The market and technology has  shown that they can withstand  the rise in rates. By technology, i am in cash  flowing elite technology.  mega cap, large-cap and leading  companies and a variety of industries.  which is where that phrase does  have merit.  look, interest rates have gone nowhere but up and tech has  been relatively resilient. We heard earlier about productivity. To some extent,  companies are getting wiser in the how they operate, but they are seeking out new ways and are using technology.  even in a slowing growing  economy, we think technology spend and capital spend will remain and that is another reason why we are resilient  with our belief that technology  is the best sector to be in. >> people might find it  interesting that you are doing that with etf, invesco and this  is not necessarily a mag seven play, but there have been a lot  of deal chatter the last couple  of days. You had shutter stock with a possible deal with the uniform space. It feels like we are starting  to get the drum be and that's  an area that you are focused on, as well, isn't it? >> yes, it is. We are overrating and  overplaying how much the new administration coming in will  matter, but not in this area.  we think that the market is  right and we think it's going  to be sustained if not supported by the incoming  administration.  it will be good for economic efficiencies and stock market. We know from the prior run how important that is to the trump administration.  we think that stocks are uniquely poised for this evaluations and and and a  related financial firms and  that is why we like the larger financial diversified capital  markets, because we do believe that there will be a boom and  it will be centered in those mid-cap companies across the board. Are you have vanguard, as well.  you like hilton and just returned to office, trouble  spend and lower cost efficiency.  i want to end on the defense sector over the years. This being the space where boeing has a little bit -- may be turning a corner that will  help.  you are not concerned by any headwinds? whatever might be coming from  doge and  that is an area that we keep hearing. We need to  spend more gdp.  >> part of my philosophy is to think about what's being said  and from the trump administration and what they are going to do. Cutting defense is not something they will do in a big  way and they will not cut  weapon systems not in the world  that we live in, plus there is a lot of proof about how technology is taking over the  war in ukraine.  i think we will look at  companies like boeing as real  leaders for our national defense.

                "Turning to earnings starting next wednesday in earnest with financials i think that will be positive, and i think that will be the catalyst for us to move forward. >> moves you're making as a  result of what could be a game changer for the rally, most of what you're doing today, it  appears to me relates to outside the sort of derivative play, if  you will, of what higher rates are going to mean. You've loved the india trade for a while. Now you're bailing on it, it looks to me, in numerous ways, through the inda, one related to small caps and the other may be  larger cap stocks. >> yeah. Look, i made money on the trade, but i didn't make as much money  as i thought with the supply chain moving from china to india, which i still think will  occur. The element you've introduced  also is that there will be more  onshoring, which was a theme already and has been a theme for a number of years. I think that accelerates,  because again, we talk about trump being pro-business, but is it really pro-business if you  get a cowardly move by mark  zuckerberg on meta to say, okay, anything goes now. And then what are the  advertisers going to think they're not going to come out  like disney and say, hey, we're  not going to be on twitter anymore, because of this,  because you can't do that. That's not politically correct in a different way now but it is influencing how  businesses work. That's not -business that's going to a certain  narrative the administration wants. As part of that, i worry about tariffs coming from india. I don't worry about tariffs  making good business sense,  because you do need some extern",

                "The pressure of upside yields  is over by a long shot.  back to you. >> appreciate it very much.  >>> just returned back to some market applications, j from  wells fargo, i know we are looking at the economic side of  things, but this is not an economic outlook and inflation to dynamic and fiscal dynamic. I don't mean bad, but as rates as it could be right now, what turns the tide?  >> what would turn the tide is you get good news in terms of  the inflation front. If you get a decent cpi print, that puts some downward  pressure on yields and another thing would be on friday when  we get to the deployment report  and a weak employment report.  people start to wonder, is the economy starting to soften here? i think it would be the  combination of weaker economic growth in terms of the economy,  as well as on the inflation  side that could potentially  turn the tide. >> you see a scenario. Does the size of the deficit factor in at all to the outlook  for next year? >> sure. We're talking about it in terms  of a cyclical sort of thing and  near-term sort of thing. Let's face it, the economy goes  into a hole sometimes soon and we are not going back down to  where the treasure yields were two or three years ago down  below 2% or something like that, so you could get a rally in  here where rates come back down  a little bit, but in order to  go back to those lows, we saw  them a few years ago and something really bad has happened to the economy just because the fiscal deficit now and debt concerns are so much  bigger than what they were even  a few years ago. >> steve, the adp number wasn't  that great this morning. If anything, yields went to the  highs after the reporting even though it was a mess and the expectation is around 150,000. That job support will be another chance for us to test  the market.  >> that's right. People are calling it the no higher no fire economy.  we will take a look, by the  way, at the challenger job layoffs data tomorrow morning  that we will get, which will give us a clue as to what's  happening. He saw the jobless claims down near a recent low just a tick  above 200,000. That's a pretty big deal.  we are not losing jobs, but not  gaining at the same pace.  that's kind of normal. The key from the fed standpoint  and shared several times that  the job market is not a source of inflation.  in fact, the job market could  be a source of disinflation  through the service sector is  indeed you have wages rising at  a slower pace. That's a good thing. Jay is absolutely right.   you need something to take the offer or bring the economy of  the boil in the sense that we  are not -- one good part about this that is not discussed a lot and they want to see the discussion in the minutes, kelly is the productivity story  that we talked about.  last week, this notion that you  have this upward move in productivity.  said it today what we said last  week, which is that it raises  the neutral rate and it does allow the economy to run hotter, but it is also a reason  why the terminal rate and sense  of where the tenure is should  be higher for that reason and  in that the fiscal deficit.  if you got a little clarity  about spending from the trump  administration and how they  were going to deal with fiscal issues, we might come up when  it comes to interest rates.  >> i agree.  i will give you last word on that.  what you think is going on with  productivity?  >> there has been some acceleration going on. Is it because of capital spending or technological  breakthroughs like ai or something like that? i'm not convinced that is  necessarily what it is, but it could be what going on, a  reflection of the tightness of the labor market over the last number of years. Business is out there and  realize that it's not like we  have workers just laying around  everywhere, but we've got to",

                "bring in show music please hi I'm CNBC producer Katie Kramer today on squawk po many things are happening that are exciting very exciting for our country not even inaugurated and making big waves around the world he's not president yet so none of it is I know but but he's going to be in 12 days president-elect Trump on Annex in Canada in Greenland and the Panama Canal what do you take seriously axio say mark Caputo says pay attention to it all just in case by now we had what 12 13 years of this we should realize it's both you have to take them literally you have to take them figuratively you have to take them seriously and sometimes you have to take them UNS seriously plus the rest of today's stories that got us squawking like those big changes at meta we never wanted to be the Arbiters of truth that's always a hard position to be in Facebook's first general counsel Chris Kelly weighs in on the new approach to factchecking and moderation online more speech is the answer to difficult speech it's Wednesday January 8 2025 squawk pod begins right now stand Becky by in 3 2 1 C please good morning everybody and welcome to squawkbox right here on CNBC we're live from the NASDAQ Market site in Time Square I'm Becky quick along with Joe kernin and Andrew Ross sorin and let's see how things are shaping up we are watching a Quantum Computing stocks and let's tell you what's going on uh sinking and extended trading this follows some of those comments by Nvidia CEO Jensen Wong during a investor Q&A call he shared his outlook on the timeline for Quantum Computing advances take a listen kind of said 15 years uh for for uh very useful quantum computers uh that would that probably be on the the early side if you said you know 30 is probably on The Late side um but if you picked 20 I I think I think a whole buch of us would believe it and but what we're interested in is we want to help the industry get there as fast as possible he also issued a warning to companies who are building quote general purpose Computing he said the era of coding by hand is over he also said that every single data center is now going to be built differently with accelerated Computing and machine learning capable machines shares of Nvidia let's show you where that stands right now uh now at about $142 it comes after a 6.2% slide yesterday his uh product re ation was viewed as significant in long-term but lacking short-term upside According to some analysts including one at stifel meantime take a look at shairs of Palante here they fell as well about 8% 7 7.8% yesterday now down about 14% for the week on Monday night several funds from Cathy Wood's Arc Investment Management unloaded nearly 200,000 total shares of paler that comes as Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of paler with an underweight rating and $60 price Target uh on Monday the analyst said success is more than priced in with palter trading around 160 times earning and that stock at 6885 I mean it was I I think the one of the best performers last year in the S&P 500 if you look at what happened with that stock too so maybe not surprising to see a pullback after a much longer upward u March at least over the last and that was really a combination of just all of the geopolitical issues in the country plus then you in the world rather to say and then you add Trump on top in the election and I think there was a view that that paler would be a massive winner depending on how you think the dod budg and everything else gets recalibrated firefighters battling overnight against a wildfire that forced evacuations in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Southern California nearly 50,000 people have been ordered to evacuate and thousands more have been told to prepare to leave strong winds have fueled the spread carrying Embers that ignited spot fires throughout the region there isolated wind gusts as strong as 100 miles an hour were expected to hit the mountains and foothills overnight according to the National Weather Service those winds are expected to remain high throughout early afternoon today schools are shut across the LA metro area nursing homes have been evacuated you've probably seen the pictures at this point of what's been happening with people trying to evacuate trying to get out through one road uh being forced to abandon their cars and then bulldozers having to come push through those cars to get them out of the way so First Responders could get through some shots from inside people's homes people still in them nice houses yeah with flames whipping up around malib a lot of people at this point have been asked to uh to exit uh that entire area which I know pretty well a lot of you think of Malibu you think of you know the blue ocean but there are beautiful Canyons all on these beautiful Golf Course a lot of of uh great real estate kind of scary President elect Trump held a wide ranging uh news conference at Mara Lago yesterday among the highlights uh Trump slammed President Biden's restrictions on offshore drilling he promised to revoke the order on day one even if it requires going to courts Trump reemphasized uh his desire to bring Greenland under Us control he made the comments soon after his son Donald Trump Jr arrived with other representatives in Greenland yesterday Trump also slammed late uh former President Jimmy Carter for selling the us built Panama Canal to Panama he said the canal was currently under discussion when asked by a reporter if he could assure the world that he would not use milit military or economic coercion in his effort to bring Greenland in the Panama Canal under Us control Trump quickly said uh no Trump also said again he hoped uh to turn Canada into an American state arguing the US is paying far too much to its northern Ally said he consider using economic Force to bring the country under uh Us control said you were considering military force to acquire Panama and Greenland are you also considering military force to Annex and acquire no economic Force because Canada and the United States that would really be something I love the Canadian people they're great but we're spending hundreds of billions a year to protect it we're spending hundreds of billions a year to take care of Canada we we lose uh in trade deficits he later uh posted this image on true social with the comment O Canada outgoing uh Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on X that there isn't a snowballs chance in hell that Canada would become part of the US Elon Musk responded girl you're not the governor of Canada anymore so it doesn't matter the governor what you say right Governor Ken govern Trump's been calling him for a while governor of a state the thing but what do you think's going on here for real and I I just think it's a bit of the Trump Doctrine I I'm not going to spend a lot of time worrying about it and thinking about I like my hair I I want my hair to stay I'm not I'm not going to set it on fire every day uh like so many people what do you take seriously I guess is the I I take seriously that Greenland is a really strategic U piece of of land that if we could we've done it many times in the past it sounds ridiculous crazy now but Cobalt lithium graph fite uh ship shipping um uh areas an access to the Arctic which we're trying to right now claims control of it claim I know they do and so and Russia used to control Alaska and Russ sold us to it well that's what we're talking about I don't know we'll see what we'll see what happens as I said I'm not going to you know start ring you might take you might use military well he he didn't say he would he said he wouldn't rule it out wouldn't rule it out I don't know whether I believe as I said it to me it's you know it's this fire hose of information Chang news that you're trying to figure out and evaluate what is real and what is not what he takes seriously what's a negotiations you don't know what's negotiations you don't know what he's trying to set himself up as things are going to change in terms of our standing in the world you look at China and Russia you look at how uh you know they view Taiwan you look at what Putin's we're not not saying there's going to be an invasion of Ukraine or something like that but in a more in a world that uh maybe people have perceived America as being weak I think he's trying to at this point say things are you know there's I appreci Sher in town I appreciated the message he sent to Hamas yesterday at the same time which was probably the most significant thing saying if you don't have some deal that's put in place to release these hostages by the time I'm here all hell is going to break Lo but then the question is what what does all hell break loose to me to me the bigger issue is how do you prioriti yeah but how do you prioritize and how do you take Serious what was the red line and how do you how do you say this is what we really care about and and and by the way totally understand sending a message like that to Hamas why we would aggravate and irritate our Northern Partners who have been really good allies for a long time I would just put them in different camps that's what depend you know lean says trade deficits don't uh matter with other countries um Canada benefits greatly from and we benefit also natural pet I don't really think I don't take that as ser I think that's sort of just uh you know I think that's almost like tweaking it's almost like um I think so too but it's weird to have all of those things that you just spin after you hear every one of these presone I know but but he's going to be in 12 days then we'll we'll we'll look back I mean I I lived through the first four years I'm fine I think everybody else was everybody else was fine in the first four years I'm I'm not I got a different one for you what's up so during the press conference there's the whole conversation about Facebook is this going to be a good thing or another scary negative thing about Trump I don't know okay you go ahead all right I know you don't want we didn't do much of this during the Biden Administration but but go ahead what what are you worried about I'm not worried about something it's a business question about okay what a business leader or business will think in reaction to this so Mark Zuckerberg clearly um takes the side of the president changes this all the so many of the policies personnel as Dana White all this kind of stuff and suggests that he's doing this because he's he believes in this stuff and thinks it's genuine he's saying that he's right you saw him on yeah right he's saying it we're going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes simplifying our policies and restoring free expression on our platforms more specifically here's what we're going to do first we're going to get rid of fact Checkers and replace them with Community notes similar to X the fact Checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created especially in the US and by the way there's been a question about whether we meaning the public are supposed to think that he's you know kissing the ring or bending the knee or whatever then the president comes out and is asked is he doing this because of the threats that you have made to meta and he says this is the President says yeah probably meta Facebook I think they've come a long way I watched it the man was very impressive I watched it actually I watched it on Fox allowed to say that do you think he's directly responding to the threats that you have made to him in the past yeah probably and I wonder whether if you're sitting as a CEO in America and watching that you're saying he's not giving me credit for anything or is he going to give him credit for this that's the that is actually a very interesting question like they say you know I'm not worried about it it's Trump but in it no but this is actually the F for businesses free speech is one of the most important things that we have in the country and I want all companies to adhere to free speech and not censor things that they don't like like laptops and lab origins of of viruses and none of this stuff and immigr anything negative on immigration can't be on Facebook all these things were banned from Facebook so if Trump says I'm for free speech and I want all voices to be heard and then Zuckerberg says okay right I'm going to do what the president said by not what he said to to him he said that he was going to put him in jail the if you are violating key provisions of of what you know we believe in then these threats even though they may be complete hyperbole but I guess your question is what does it mean for CEOs and how will they behave well I think the question is I think there's a lot of people who've gone down to Mar Lago and have I mean let's call it they've kissed the ring right and they're hoping they're kissing the ring and and I think a lot of them believe themselves that they're kissing the ring for the right reason meaning that the they they actually changed their position or not or maybe we're give too much credit for that I don't know but then to have the president come out and say actually yeah he's doing it under direct except for that here's the difference the president wasn't reaching out and putting that on Truth social doing it unprompted a reporter asked him a question totally he answered honestly what by the way very honest answer yeah what a concept we haven't seen a lot of that uh but but it it it is interesting because I think there is this calculus that takes place in many corporate leaders heads trying to figure out how to how to na because this is what they do they navigate administrations here around the globe and this is them trying to different here's the presidency we're still under right now so this is the kind of this is what we hear from the guy who who's still in charge you want to talk about a snowballs Helen CH chance in hell he didn't have a snowballs chance he can he can barely put one foot in front of the other this was never going to well you I'm just saying I'm just say you got your guy you should be very happy I am happy but I want just wish we had the same micromanaging of everything that was done for the past four it was totally outrageous I just wish we would have had the same introspect from or U skepticism and looking at every that from the mainstream media that we're now having for this new Administration which isn't even in yet they got we talked religiously about how how this guy wouldn't take a meeting with CEOs in America and that was a problem we yeah after he finally couldn't put two words together in aate it didn't happen we've been complaining about that for four years on this show oh God he through he Biden got a free pass for four years we don't need to we don't well now you don't want to there was some great press coverage for the four years of trump nothing for the four years of Biden just like a free pass on the most outrageous stuff now we're going to be back to doing this every day that's why I say I like my hair I can't go through it again will be next still to come the reverberations of Facebook choice to do away with third-party fact Checkers we'll check in with the company's first Chief legal officer on this shift it's a return to a free speech tradition that we very much tried to respect even as we did more content moderation uh in the early days of Facebook this is squawk pod stand andby in 3 2 1 Q you're watching squawkbox on CNBC I'm Andrew R sorin along with Joe kernin and Becky quick got a whole bunch of big stories this morning perhaps couple of the biggies meta platforms announcing it's going to end its thirdparty factchecking on its services and move to user generated systems of check mark similar to the community notes program on X cbc's learned that some meta employees took to the company's in-house Communications tool to voice their displeasure although criticism didn't account for all of the posts one worker said it appeared meta was sending a message that facts no longer matter and conflating that with a victory for free speech joining us right now Chris Kelly Facebook's former Chief privacy officer and former general counsel he's the founder of Kelly Investments and let's just start with the basics what did you think when you first heard this announcement many ways it's a it's a return to a free speech tradition that we very much tried to respect even as we did more content moderation uh in the early days of Facebook um cleaning up the ability to communicate and being able to you know easily present one's views was a critical part of the network from the beginning and in some ways Mark Clearly feels that we've gotten away from that and uh this change is meant to effective where do you where do you stand on this issue and the reason I ask is you know I think there's a question as to where is has Mark's mind evolved or was this is always where Mark sort of head was and maybe with some of the people around him and I'm thinking of the Nick Kels and Cher Samberg and others that pushed him in another Direction what's the sort of genuine view of this well I I think you have to create a space that allows people to communicate effectively and that requires some ability to push back um in the American free speech tradition that is usually with more speech and not in in in taking you know too much down and we always we never wanted to be the Arbiters of of truth that's always a hard position to be in um you know but you have to make sure that that you know your community doesn't decline into a cesspool of of of accusations back and forth all the time and and and of the presentation of misinformation either um the AI tools that Facebook has deployed and meta has deployed over time on all of its networks still operate here and there will be um addressing of of child sexual abuse material of illegal content things like that a huge part part of the decisions in the past I would say were business decisions business decisions based on at least a view maybe wrongly but a view that advertisers uh wanted this kind of control over the platform or at least people were telling Mark Zuckerberg that the question now is whether advertisers will stick with the platform very interestingly I would argue to you that X now is obviously a much uh broader platform today in the to the extent that it's more free speech oriented but it hasn't necessarily worked uh as an advertising platform I I I do think that advertisers are continue going to continue to express their opinions and they're not going to want to have their brand advertising in particular appear um next to offensive material and and I think that that will continue to be a piece of pressure on the company um just as it is on X and on every other platform so I don't think that that this this will actually end up making a massive difference in your day-to-day experience on Facebook so you don't think it changes do you think that the experience on on X has changed I I I do think it has and and we'll see if that works for advertisers over time um I I think that there's some you know encouraging uh you know indications that that you know there's some adaptation that's going on I think the community notes feature is excellent and it's been implemented very well on what did you make I mean there was sort of an interesting moment yesterday during the the Trump press conference because you know on one side you saw Mark Zuckerberg take to Facebook and Instagram announcing all of this and I think uh making a a i I hope genuine argument I'm sure there are people who question how genuine it was but then of course later in the after and saying that he was doing it in part because he thinks that politically the the country has moved and then you know 3 hours later you have Trump being asked whether he's effectively doing this genuinely or whe whether he's doing this because of the threats that have come from Trump and he says yeah probably probably because he's doing it under duress I I did see that but I I do think and having been there in the initial discussions we always wanted to Hue to the American free speech tradition which is more speech is the answer to difficult speech um that that it was meant to Facebook is meant to be a place for discourse and the you know you know de emphasis of of political content and the ability to express yourself is something that that I I think that the there's some regrets around the way that that was implemented particularly um in the postco period how do you think this changes the regulatory story for meta meaning there there's there's a whole bunch there's a whole bunch of uh of of State well I don't know what you think is going to happen to the attorney generals but there's a whole bunch of of of regulatory issues that are around meta right now and the question is whether you think they disappear well I no I certainly don't think they disappear I think that there's going to continue to be a bunch of discussions and I think that the company has tried to to act very responsibly around addressing uh some of the worries about harm and self harm material that's presented online um some of the controls that they've tried to introduce particularly on Instagram and teen accounts and things like that um you know this has always been an incredibly complex problem um there isn't really a right answer at the end of the day unfortunately for the company or for uh everyone online you're dealing with expression which is a messy messy thing that uh uh you know sometimes people are you know expressing themselves in in ways that are are hurtful um to themselves or to others and you have to figure out a way to you know guide a discussion so that it's civilized and and that people get a lot of value you know that's one of the key one of the key things that they're trying to return to Chris Andrew and I were were having a question discuss yesterday I was thinking about it at home because Andrew was saying you you thought maybe section whatever it is 230 yeah that you should get rid of it and then I said I think I was saying that about Andrew about like protections for like teens that are getting like naked photo shared and they should be liable I don't think I ever meant it for for like the free flow of like news or information or or things like way topar well prevents from being for anything that's posted on on I know but but it seems like you'd have to do it in in in a way where certain stuff you are liable for but but but airing news that may or may not you know you you can't know when you're airing something laptop for example CH uh the V the lab origin of a virus you can't know well you would just be you would be subject it doesn't mean you can't you don't want people that you can have people come after you to say did you have malicious intent with but the bullying part in in in all the all the horrible stuff that happens on on social media the kids they have to take responsibility that but those are separate issues aren't they free spee versus actual U nefarious intent to harm people one of one of the most interesting things about the section 230 debate that that people have often you know neglected is that it actually allows you to take action against harmful material online um effectively and and one of the reasons that that I always thought it shouldn't be changed is is that is is precisely because of that you have effectively a safe harbor for some things that you're doing to address those problematic pieces of content for addressing clearly illegal content like child sexual abuse material and some of the revenge porn things that have gone on online and you can still go after that prosecute the company can still take action about it and it and it actually is sort of encouraged to do so by the protections of section 230 so that's been a kind of Mi a misnomer over time I feel like it would be stronger Chris you're yelling us we got to go but I feel like it would be much stronger if 230 didn't exist there would it would be much more pressure on companies to make sure that they were going after them not just encouraged to do it but you're in trouble if you don't uh I I I mean I think you're still in trouble if you don't there's certainly a lot of regulatory pressure um on addressing it even under a section 230 rine Chris uh come on back there's so much more to talk about with this we really appreciate it it's great to see you absolutely thanks so much for having next on squawk pod Greenland Panama Canada president-elect Trump has floated us expansion an axio senior politic reporter Mark Caputo says as wild as it seems we should take Donald Trump seriously at least sometimes unlike an administrations and campaigns past Donald Trump has a staff and structure around him that says well if Donald Trump says it then we'll try to make it happen welcome back to squawk pod from CNBC where were digesting yesterday's hourong news conference with president-elect Trump the Panama Canal is a disgrace what took place at the Panama Canal they laugh at us because they think we're stupid but we're not stupid anymore we need Greenland for national security purposes I've been told that for a long time long before I even ran I mean people have been talking about it for a long time I'm talking about protecting the Free World you look at you don't even need binoculars you look outside you have China ships all over the place you have Russian ships all over the place we're not letting that happen here's Andrew Ross sorin President elect Trump renewing his call to gain Us control of Greenland also the Panama Canal maybe even Canada yesterday he declined to rule out using military and economic coercion to achieve those goals join us right now with more on all this Mark Caputo is a senior politics reporter for axios good morning to you uh we were debating a little bit of this earlier in the broadcast Mark and I think we're all trying to figure out how much of this we're supposed to take seriously how much we're supposed to take a sort of trump Doctrine uh a negotiating posture of sorts how do you view it one of the things that was said in what 2016 is not to take Trump or that his voters didn't always take Trump literally they took him figuratively I think by now we had what 12 13 years of this we should realize it's both you have to take them literally you have to take them figuratively you have take him seriously and sometimes you have to take him UNS seriously so the short answer to question is I don't know I don't think any of us knows the likelihood that we're actually going to acquire Greenland in some way shape or form when we've got trillions in debt and a huge budget deficit is pretty slim considering the narrow margins in Congress because after all Congress will probably need to do something about taking over New Territory but nevertheless Trump wants to do this in some way shape or form and unlike an Administration and campaigns passed Donald Trump has a staff and structure around him that says well if Donald Trump says it then we'll try to make it happen well how much is it worth Mark I mean I wonder what the blue book is and you remember you remember I I if it's not that much money I I I disagree that that the budget uh deficit wouldn't allow it it certainly allows us to uh to expend a lot of money on on other things uh like that help for Ukraine help for other places we spent I don't remember what we spent on Alaska but it was it was called a Folly at the time I think it would do you remember what it was it was in the millions I don't even think it was in the billions when it happened and one of the great purchases obviously of all time and Greenland if it could be done if you could you know we talk about coercion make them an offer they can't refuse what does that mean exactly that's a good question well in the case of Seward buying Alaska zarus Russia wanted to sell it in the case of Greenland Denmark right now doesn't million million I'll take two right exactly but in the end it's not just whether we can afford it or not it's whether Congress thinks we can afford it or not there are very narrow margins in Congress it's just difficult to see that doesn't mean that Donald Trump isn't serious about it or you know grading on a Donald Trump curve whether he's seriously using about it but we should take it seriously and once he's began talking about this again remember he discussed this in 2018 and 2019 people have to take him seriously about it his campaign does or better said ad but let's let's sort of walk through the various component parts of what was said so there's the Greenland piece which it sounds like if he could purchase it he would the question is if he couldn't purchase it or couldn't afford to or something like that would he use military force to somehow get it that's one piece then there's the Panama Canal and then there's Canada as the 51st state in the United States what do you think is even realistic there and let's just even talk about the political implications of all this which is to say the way Canada for example or even the folks in Panama right now are reacting to all of this they're about to I live in Miami my county commissioner Kevin Cabrera is about to be the Panama the Ambassador for the United States to Panama and so he's going to have his hands full I do think that out of the three scenario as you laid out here Trump is most concerned about Panama not only because of China's presence as a global power trade superpower but also because of the Darian gap which is the only land bridge connecting South America with Central and North America therefore and that has been a major migrant throughway and so Donald Trump who is keenly concerned about trade about China and about immigration is looking at Panama and is very concerned about it so I think out of the three that we've discussed here that is the most likely for him to devote more time policy and resources toward what what about the Canada piece though because they are our neighbor they have been uh an ally a great Ally and there are now concerns you read the the papers in Canada turn on the TVs there I was reading or seeing some video that was coming across on social media and they're you know it sounds like they're apoplectic about what's happening I imagine they are I mean Canada for its entire history has lived in fear of its barbaric brother to the South the United States invading it and taking it over it opted not to become part of the United States even though uh a number of our early founding fathers and our early presents wanted it to the conservative leader of Panama and I must said or better said of Canada whose last name is French and I therefore can't pronounce it because I too am one of these barbarians he's even discounted this so this one is a little harder to see out of all of them the Greenland piece is hard for me to see the Panama piece is less hard to see out of all real quick just finally and you were talking about the people around him uh wanting to help him accomplish these things there was a sense in 2016 that there were people around him who didn't want to help him accomplish uh things that he talked about and so that they were almost blocking or preventing certain things are slow walking things how different is that today and how should we think about that I wrote In axios on Monday that his incoming chief of staff was his campaign co-manager Susie WS who's been with him stuck with him to thick and thin she has the understanding of letting Trump be Trump and trying to execute on his vision and hiring people who are loyal to him loyal to his mission and believe in getting things done for him and not undermining him that's why for instance we haven't seen what we would have seen in the past which would have been Anonymous staff leaks saying oh my God this guy is crazy there's no way we're going to do that not hearing that anymore so that's one of the reasons that we have to take the Greenland the Canada and Panama pieces more seriously is because his staff does Mark want to thank you for joining us this morning we will see what happens and in the meantime I'm sure we'll talk a lot about we will thanks thanks that is squawk pod for today this Wednesday thank you for listening squawkbox is hosted by Joe kernin Becky

Marching steadily higher and hit 7.71% according to mortgage  news daily, which is the highest since early june.  one month ago, it was below 6% and home sales were starting to  pick up, but higher rates are  taking a toll on mortgage  demand.  applications to refinance last week were down 6% year-over-year and applications for mortgage  to buy a home were down 10%  according to the bankers association. The realtors had been saying that homebuyers are getting  used to a new normal of higher rates, but that is not showing up to start the new year, at lost least not in mortgage demand.  much of that is because homes  are just sitting on the market much longer. High prices combined with  higher rates are sidelining  would-be buyers. The forecast for this year is  that mortgage rates will fall  modestly, but stay above 6%  with volatility.

Rick?  >> first of all, the yield at  this auction was 4.913.  it was trading 4.92%. Lower  yield and auction the entire price governments to seller, which is a good thing. That yield i told you is the highest yield at a 30 year bond  auction since august 2007. Should yields close anywhere towards the upper end of this  range on a 30 year bond to 493 and 495 area, that will be the highest going back to october  of 2023. If we go to the metrics, it  gets an a on every level.  solid bid to cover and indirect  and extremely solid, dealers take much less then auction  average. They take less than 13% and 10 auction average 15% and this completes the three lanes of 119 billion and coupon supply, so as you look at the charts and see those yields falling,  that makes sense.  we're over the hump of supply  and the concession seems to be how much higher they moved in  the last several days. Don't forget that tomorrow is a  holiday.

                "Communication, though she also said the recent hack of the  treasury doesn't help the  u.s./china relationship. Joining us now with reaction is  ian bremer, he released his new  list of the top political risks  to watch in 2025 the progress that janet yellen has made with her counterparts in china, what happens to that under trump 2.0. >> first, i think she is right to take some credit, you know, the relationship between the u.s. And china got worse before  it got better under the biden  administration, that initial summit they had in anchorage it  was a disaster, china lecturing  them in return and walking out but last year has really been  much more stable, they've worked on the relationship, they've opened 25 high-level bilateral channels including with  treasury, with commerce, defense, very important, and they've done it to stable ides the relationship without the americans giving away the store, tariffs haven't been removed export controls. U.s. Isn't giving up on taiwan you talk to democrats and  republicans on the hill they don't have a lot to criticize  biden about on china and they're not usually shy, right, so i do  think she's right to lean into that, but it's very unlikely in  my view that that relationship,  that state of affairs between  the u.s. And china will persist  with the incoming trump  administration in part because of the orientation of his top  advisers in cabinet and in part  because trump's focus on tariffs which i certainly think he's going to come out swinging in  the early weeks. >> how do you think china reacts to that because on one hand it's very confrontational on the  other hand he invited xi to his  inauguration.  >> trump always talks about how  brilliant xi is as a strong  leader, how much respect he has  for him, not like trump has a  problem meeting with people he doesn't agree with, think about  kim jong-un last time around and trump loves the idea of cutting  deals, but this is a different environment, i think you'll have a really hard time, even though  they'll have pleasant  conversations with what xi is  willing to offer, i'll buy some  soybeans, i'll buy some boeings  if any are being produced, but that's not going to be enough to get the trump administration to  back away from what's a much more hawkish orientation, not  just on china bilaterally but  also in cutting off the chinese  at the knees and the third countries they're shipping goods through to the united states like mexico facing a lot of  pressure on china from the incoming trump administration, india, vietnam, this is  something that the trump economic team is very, very  focused on and it's going to hurt the chinese >> isn't that the whole point  around the tariffs to get around that label washing.  >> that's right. The chinese government felt like they had a pretty good strategy  in doing that and the trump  administration intends to stop it there's an orientation to cut a  deal if the chinese were really  willing to, you know, sort of  take a knee and cry uncle for  the trump administration but i don't think that's going to  happen it's in the mexico or canada and again the symbolic level they're willing to pay off trump to make him go away, but the demands being made by the trump ed administration are must more substantive and structural than  that i'd pay more attention to the  fact that the chinese are doing  a lot with trying to improve their relationship with india. Japan ending the export controls they've had on the seafood they  said was tainted from fukushima. Why are they suddenly doing that all over the world because they're preparing for a  much more challenging  relationship with the united states, and they also note that  there are a lot of countries around t",

                "A crucial time for america's  fiscal future. Joining me here exclusively at  the treasury department is the  treasury secretary, janet  yellen. Thank you so much for having us  here.  >> pleasure. Thanks for the invitation.  >> we were just reminiscing,  here earlier 2021 in the depth  of covid, a lot has changed.  >> a lot has changed.  >> the economy has been  resilient. Interest rates were rising,  inflation was raging and yet,  amazingly the economy has  maintained this 2%, 3% growth,  the question is, why was it a  losing issue for the democrats  in the election? >> well, we have seen really  solid growth and we did  experience a surge in inflation  and most people never lived  through an episode like that,  the level of prices about 20%  higher than pre-pandemic, and of course the rate of inflation has come way down, it's now pretty  close, quite close to the fed's  target. So prices are continuing to rise at anything like that and now  very close to normal. But, people i think have  remember these big price  increases and, you know, they  feel it had a very adverse  effect on their cost of living. Now at this point, wages have  gone up a lot, and if you  compare the typical household  now to pre-pandemic, they can  buy the same basket of goods  they could have had in 2019 with we estimate about $1600 leftover to spare, so in real terms wages have outpaced inflation and now  over the last year or more, on  the consistent basis, wage  increases are outstripping  inflation, but there was a  period in which price increases  were very high. >> i it still feels like because we remember the prices before  covid. Prices at the grocery store are  so much higher. When you look back at it do you  have any regrets about the  fiscal stimulus and extra  spending put in place, adding  fuel to the fire when it comes  to kind of sparking that high  inflation.  >> so, i think it's important to remember what the world looked  like when we entered the  beginning of the biden  administration, weed a a  pandemic that was raging out of  control and thousands of people  were dying on a monthly basis  and the unemployment remained  extremely high and people, many  people who had lost their jobs  although they were being  supported by unemployment  insurance were in a position  they could lose the roof over  their heads and we saw people in cars lining up at food banks to  make sure that they could feed  their families and it was really important to spend the money to  alleviate that suffering to make sure that small businesses  didn't go out of business  because of the pandemic. People would have lost their livelihoods, their businesses  that they had invested in, and we wanted to alleviate all of  that suffering we had seen in past downturns  like the great -- during the great recession that people who  were unemployed for a very long  time become scar, alienated from the workforce, they can never  get their lives back on track, i call that scarring and we wanted to avoid that. I think the spending was necessary. >> did it spark the inflation? >> it may have contributed a little bit to the inflation. But by and large, the inflation  was supplyside phenomena the pandemic had led to  shortages of goods coming from china and other parts of the world, it shut down firms like our auto firms without enough  semiconductors to be able to build cars, so there was simply  huge supply chain problems and goods, critical goods that people wanted were in absolute shortage and i think an  important factor in the  inflation ",

Defense is around a trillion dollar spending. Nondefense iscretionary is close to $900 billion. So, that's $2 trillion right there and maybe feel that  defense spending should go up. Mandatory spending which includes social security,  medicare and medicaid, you know  these programs are important to  americans, both democrats and  republicans, have indicated  support for these programs and they're very popular among americans.

IN CHINA. PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN UP ON IT. VALUATIONS ARE SUPERATTRACTIVE  AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS, YOU HAVE A GOVERNMENT WHERE, YOU KNOW,  FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION FOR  THIS STIMULUS PACKAGE, THEY'LL  DO WITH WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET BOTH THE ECONOMY TO STABILIZE  AND TO START GROWING AGAIN AND  ALSO TO GET STOCK PRICES HIGHER  AND I THINK YOU WANT TO BE ON  THE SAME SIDE WITH WHAT THAT  TYPE OF GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING TO DO.  >> THAT'S INTERESTING. IT'S FELT A BIT EXTREME LOOKING  AT RECORD-LOW BUYING YIELDS OVER THERE. THE FLIGHT OF CAPITAL. BUT YOU DO SEE SOMETHING  HAPPENING THERE. MEANTIME, BACK STATESIDE WE'VE  BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE FED PRICING IN TERMS OF CUTS, GOING  AWAY FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE  YEAR, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE  EXPECTING ANY IN FIRST HALF  EITHER.  >> WE'RE NOT. THE MARKET IS PRICING IN ONE CUT IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR,  WE THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON  PAUSE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT SIX  MONTHS, WE WERE NOT NECESSARILY  IN AGREEMENT WITH CUTTINGS THEY  DID ALREADY. I THINK WHAT THEY'RE SEEING,  STILL CPI AND PCS WELL ABOVE 2%. PRICES PAID NUMBER YESTERDAY HIT 64. AND WE HAVE A VERY PRO-GROWTH  ADMINISTRATION COMING IN. THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS FOR  THEM TO TAKE A PAUSE, WAIT AND  SEE, SEE WHAT POLICIES ARE  IMPLEMENTED AND ALSO SEE WHAT  HAPPENS WITH INFLATION. IF INFLATION DOES START TO  RE-ACCELERATE TO THE UPSIDE, I  THINK THE MARKET'S GOING TO HAVE A BIG ISSUE WITH THAT AND I  THINK THERE ARE REASONS TO  BELIEVE THAT'S CERTAINLY A  POSSIBILITY. I THINK THE FED ISN'T GOING TO  WANT TO TAKE A RISK OF CUTTING  EVEN FURTHER UNTIL WE HAVE  EVIDENCE THAT'S NOT THE CASE.  >> ERIC, I'M TRYING TO FIGURE  OUT WHAT YOUR POSTURE IS TOWARD  EQUITIES AT THE MOMENT. MOST OF LAST YEAR I BELIEVE YOU  WERE PRETTY NEGATIVE AND PRETTY  BEARISH ON STOCKS AND THE  OVERALL ECONOMY, HAVE YOU  CHANGED YOUR TUNE? >> SO, IN TERMS OF THE MARKET,  WE HAD A MUCH MORE  TRADING-ORIENTED VIEW, YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR. IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMY, WE  THINK WE'RE IN A LATE CYCLE  ECONOMY, WE STL BELIEVE THAT,  WE ALSO THINK THE NEXT THREE YOU KNOW TO SIX MONTHS WITH THE NEW  ADMINISTRATION COMING IN,  CONFIDENCE SURGING AMONG CEOs. THE WEALTH EFFECT IS PROVIDING A BIG TAIL WIND THERE. BETWEEN HOUSING AND STOCK PRICES THE WEALTH CREATION OVER THE  PAST YOU KNOW CALL IT SIX TO  NINE MONTHS HAS BEEN SO GREAT  THAT WE THINK THAT'S ALSO GOING  TO CARRY FORWARD AND YOU'RE  SEEING THAT IN THE ECONOMIC DATA AND WE THINK THAT CONTINUES AT  LEAST FOR THE NEXT THREE TO SIX  MONTHS AND WE'LL SEE WHERE RATES ARE AN",

                ">>> welcome back to \"squawk on  the street.\"  j.p.  morgan is the latest company  reportedly bringing workers  back to the office five days a  week.  of course, that push to get  workers back to the office in  2025 could be a tailwind for  commercial real estate,  especially right here in new  york city.  scott rechler has got a lot  more on the state of commercial  real estate market in this new  year.  happy new year.  you know i've talked to you in  years past, whether it was 2024  or 2023, you certainly didn't  sound very positive waiting for  the storm to clear so to speak.  the banks to decline in the  value of some of those loans.  >> i think what has happened is  the federal reserve by using  their rhetoric was able to get  the markets loose.  the stop markets up.  the bond markets were open and  the regulators sort of gave  some room.  so this storm sort of hovered  around the coast, but never  actually came onto the coast.  during that period of time, you  saw the big banks, they were  taking reserves.  people were capitulating on  values.  people were estimating where  interest rates were.  so i think '24 is the floor  right now.  '24, we're at this floor where  we're now going to be in  position to start dealing with  these things, but it's not  going to be as distressed as it  was, because the capital has  acknowledged the valuations.  we'll see transaction activity  take place.  >> we will.  but we're sort of at the end of  that, so to speak.  >> i think people who waited in  '24 hoping that interest rates  were going to go low and save  them are going to have a hard  time surviving '25.  for those who say let's go  negotiate with lenders, be  opportunistic, you can thrive  in '25.  we still have a challenge of  all these loans.  $2.3trillion of loans that have  to be refinanced, the bulk of  that over the next three years  at rates that are going to be  much higher than where they  were originally set.  >> you started a distress fund,  i think it was last year.  have you done anything from it?  >> so we've, this year invested  in 9.5 million square feet of  classic office space.  we started by institutional  owners, who just didn't want to  be anything near office was  toxic.  we were buying it at discounted  prices and going to the banks  and renegotiating.  buy great buildings, fix the  capital structures and in  places like new york, you get  them leased.  we work with organizations that  say i see the demand out there,  i don't want to abandon it.  this week, we're going to buy  49% interest in a class a  trophy building with an  institution that says i want to  stay in 51%, but i want to  hedge my bet.  bring in somebody bringing in  good capital, to spend good  money, not bad.  >> have cities been smart about  conversions to the degree that  it's soaking up some of that  eninventory?  >> new invintory?  >> they did put in policies,  the state did and the city of  yes housing program, so you've  seen a dramatic increase of  buildings that actually qualify  for conversion",

KEITH, I KNOW YOU'VE LIKED TECH  FOR A WHILE AND REMAIN BULLISH,  BUT TEN YEAR YIELD AT 4.7, DOES  IT CHANGE THINGS?  >> IT DOES SENSE AN INTERNAL  CORRECTION PERIOD THAT'S REALLY  STARTED BACK ON DECEMBER 6th  THAT COINCIDED WITH A LOWER  YIELD.  IT REALLY HASN'T MOVED THAT  MUCH.  REALLY, THE UNCERTAINTY FACTOR  --  >> KEITH, KEITH --  >> YES?  >> KEITH, I'M SORRY, I'VE GOT  TO CUT YOU OFF, BECAUSE YOUR  AUDIO IS ECHOING.  SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FIX  THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU, SO WE  CAN HEAR YOU.  BUT CLEARLY, YOU KNOW, CARL AND  DAVID, THE TEN YEAR MOVE, IT'S  CAUGHT SOME PEOPLE BY SURPRISE.  STOCKS NEVER QUITE LIKE IT WHEN  YOU SEE THIS SHARP FAST MOVE  HIGHER IN THE TEN YEAR AND THE  30 YEAR MOVE.  ESPECIALLY WHEN IT RAISES  QUESTIONS ABOUT SUPPLY AND WHO  IS GOING TO BE BUYERS OF  TREASURY, AND LONG TERM  DEFICITS AND WHAT'S GOING TO  HAPPEN WITH THE NEW  ADMINISTRATION.  THAT FEELS LIKE IT'S LAGGING.  WHEN YOU LOOK AT TECHNOLOGY,  WHICH IS BASED ON FUTURE  VALUATIONS FOR PROFITABILITY,  THERE ARE QUESTIONS.  CARL, YOU MENTIONED THE HALO  AFFECT FROM NVIDIA AT CES, IT'S  COINCIDING WITH MOVING RATES.  >> BOND VOLATILITY, HIGHEST  SINCE NOVEMBER 19th.  I WOULD NOTE A COUPLE COMMENTS  ABOUT VALUATION, THIS WEEK  ALONG FROM HOWARD MARKS AND  GOVERNOR COOK ON MONDAY, SAYING  IN SOME AREAS OF THE MARKET WE  MIGHT BE PRICED FOR PERFECTION  AND VULNERABLE TO A SHARP  DECLINE.  >> YEAH, I THINK THAT CONCERN  CERTAINLY GETS RAISED AT THIS  POINT.  SARAH, YOU RAISED IT AS WELL,  JUST INTEREST COSTS ALSO, WITH  THE EXPECTATION RATES WOULD BE  COMING DOWN.  NO SUCH LUCK AT THIS POINT.  OBVIOUSLY AN OVERALL FOCUS ON  THE BUDGET IS THE DEBTS WE'RE  PAYING ON ROUGHLY $37 TRILLION.  >> I KNOW, IT'S CRAZY.

HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HEAR ME NOW.  >>  YES.  >> I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL, OUR  VIEW IS STILL POSITIVE.  I THINK IN THE SHORT TERM BASIS  THE MARKET IS GOING THROUGH A  CORRECTION THAT BEGAN IN LATE  DECEMBER.  IF YOU LOOK AT THE S & P 500 AS  A WHOLE, THE MARKET PEAKED BACK  ON DECEMBER 6th.

                "Yet.  >> i'm sure not the last we've  talked about quantum in the  months to come.  kate rooney this morning.  >>> meantime, nvidia shares are  rebounding a bit after posting  their worst day since  september.  the semis are up to a pretty  good start for the year, up 4%.  the buy rating on nvidia, 175  target.  i think it's interesting that  so much attention on ces and  the halo affect has almost been  as powerful as the nvidia  affect on itself, commentary  about toyota.  commentary about samsung, all  coming out of jensen in week.  >> yeah, certainly.  partly it's what we've seen in  semiconductors over the last  year or two years, right?  nvidia and a.i.  have been moving the entirety  of the market and they've been  pulling names that either are  also involved in a.i.  like marvel and broad com or  names that supply nvidia.  it's been a continuation of  what we've been seeing, i  think.  >> we talk a lot about market  concentration.  this same dynamic exists within  semis itself.  you've got the sector at an all- time high.  but only one in five i think  over the 200 day.  do you expect there will be a  broadening in semis too?  >> yeah.  i think the problem is that you  have a very robust spending  environment for data center  a.i.  and then at the same time, we  have a not so robust spending  environment for almost  everything else.  so whether it's consumer  electronics, industrial  applications, enterprise spend,  they're all kind of lagging.  and i think what's not helping  that portion of the market is  there's a whole lot of  uncertainty around what we get  with a new administration.  so do you see tariffs that  force a shift to manufacturing?  and because of that  uncertainty, it's hard for  companies to plan.  so i don't see things changing  right now.  i think a.i.  continues to do well and  everyone else kind of tries to  figure out what's going on with  the world economy moving  forward.  >> do you expect the tariff  picture o clarify in, let's  say the first half?  >> i mean, i don't know.  that's the problem.  that's the problem with all  these companies.  they want certainty around  planning, right?  you don't want to build a new  facility in mexico and find out  that all of a sudden your  investment isn't worthwhile,  because you've got this tariff  penalty that's been applied.  >> is nvidia the top of your  universe at the moment in terms  of favorites?  >> nvidia is up there.  i personally like taiwan  semiconductor a little bit more  than nvidia.  but these are all gradations.  >> and finally, we mentioned  toyota and some of the  automotive stuff.  we've talked a lot about  weakness in auto as an end  market, do you see that  reversing?  >> i think that you need the  consumer to reverse.  so whether it's the u.s.  consumer, whether it's the  worldwide consumer, that you  need more momentum there, not  just for autos, but across  technologies.  a lot of the new things that  the people are talking about,  so autonomous driving for  autos, really interesting can  create these refresh cycles,  but we need to see it starting  to get applied.  so i think when you start ",

                ">>> welcome back to \"squawk  box.\"  meta platforms announcing it's  going to end third party fact  checking, and moving to user  generated systems, similar to  the notes community program on  x. Some meta employees took to  the in house employees and  expressed their criticism.  one worker said it appeared  meta was sending a message that  facts no longer matter and  conflating that with a victory  for free speech.  joining us right now, chris  kelly, facebook's former chief  privacy officer.  he's the founder of kelly  investments.  let's just start with the  basics.  what did you think when you  first heard this announcement?  >> in many ways, it's a return  to a free speech tradition that  we in many ways tried to  respect, even as we did more  content moderation in the early  days of facebook.  cleaning up the ability to  communicate and being able to  easily present one's views was  a critical part of the network  from the beginning.  and in some ways mark feels  we've gotten away from that.  >> where do you stand on this  issue?  i think there's a question, has  mark's mind evolved, or was  this always where mark's head  sort of us, and maybe some of  the people around him and i'm  thinking of the others that  pushed him in another  direction.  what's this sort of genuine  view of this?  >> i think you have to create a  space?  that allows people to  communicate effectively.  that requires some ability to  push back.  in the american free speech  tradition that is usually with  more free speech, and not in  taking, you know, too much  down.  we always, we never wanted to  be the arbiters of truth.  that's always a hard position  to be in.  you know, but you have to make  sure that, you know, your  community doesn't decline into  a sesspool of accusations back  and forth all the time, and of  the presentation of  misinformation either.  the a.i.  tools that facebook has  deployed, and meta has deployed  over time on all of its  networks still operate here and  there will be addressing of  child sexual abuse material, of  illegal content, things like  that.  >> chris, a huge part of the  decisions in the past, i would  say were business decisions.  business decisions based on at  least a view, maybe wrongly,  but a view that advertisers  wanted this kind of control  over the platform.  or at least people were telling  mark zuckerberg that.  the question now is whether  advertisers will stick with the  platform.  very interestingly, i would  argue to you that x now is  obviously a much broader  platform today to the extent  that it's more free speech  oriented, but it hasn't  necessarily worked as an  advertising platform.  >> i do think the advertisers  are going to continue to  express their opinions, and  they're not going to want to  have their brand advertising in  particular appear next to  offensive material.  i think that will continue to  be a piece of pressure on the  company just as it is on x and  every other platform.  so i don't think that this will  actually end up making a  massive difference in your day- to-day experience on facebook.  >> so you don't think it  changes.  do you think the experience on  x has changed?  >> i do think it has.  and we'll see if that works for  advertisers vertime.  i think there's some  encouraging indications that,  you know, there's some  adaptation that's going on.  the community feature is  excellent, and it's been  implemented very well.  >> there's an interesting  moment yesterday during the  press conference.  on one side, you saw mark  zuckerberg taking to facebook  and instagram, announcing all  of this.  making, i hope a genuine  argument, but then of course,  and saying that he was doing it  in part because politically the  country has moved.  and then three hours later, you  have trump being asked whether  he's ffectively doing this  genuinely or whether he's doing  this because of the threats  that have come from trump, and  he says yeah, probably.  it's probably because he's  doing it under duress.  >> i did see that.  but i do think, having been  there in the initial  discussions, we always wanted  to adhere to the american free  speech tradition, which is more  speech is the answer to  difficult speech.  it was meant -- facebook was  meant ",

Inflation expectations are  stable.  we don't have an inflation  problem.  we have an inflation issue  relative to a 2% target.  you heard previously, this  notion of sticking inflation,  that's actually stable  inflation.  that doesn't disrupt the  underlying economy in any  fundamental way.  >> are you arguing for them to  cut rates even as inflation is  hotter than they'd been hoping  for?  >> my worry is the opposite.  if they really believe in 2%  inflation, they would hike  rates.  >> so this is an argument  against them hiking rates.  >> correct.  so if they really believed it,  what i think we're going to  hear is yes, we are aiming for  2% inflation, but down the  road, and we're going to  tolerate, we may get one cut  this year, but we should not  want them to be dead set on 2%.  because if they're dead set on  2% the rates are going un.  >> do you up.  >> what would happen in the  markets if either there are no  cuts or they raised cuts?  >> i think we can live with no  cuts.  i think we've adjusted  dramatically.  from a year ago, we were  expecting 6 to 8 cut.  now we're expecting 1 to 2. The  market has all the way back to  july.  this economy remains robust.  >> we got the headlines from  waller's speech today about  what he's going to be talking  about.  i have to say, i was a little  surprised it was more doveish  than i had anticipated.  because they've worked so hard  to try and get to the point  where the market is not  expecting them to cut rates at  every meeting.  this sounded more doveish.  and raised more questions about  this.  i don't know what you thought  about his comments.  >> i was as surprised as you  were.  i do know, if i'm sitting in  the fed right now, i have to  navigate two landscapes.  monetary policy and politics.  >> there's a lot of people that  are nodding with you, because  we can deflate our way out of  some of the step, but the  difference between 2% and 3%  compounded pour the dollar is  devastating.  for you to just blow it off is  a little weird.  there's a reason they want 2%.  anyone can move goal posts.  that's 5% higher than 2%.  >> do you know where 2% comes  from?  >> 3%, it would make all of us  feel awful in ten years.  >> 2% comes from the bank of  new zealand in the '90.  it's an arbitrary number.  >> 5 is an arbitrary number, if  you want to deflate 36  trillion, let's go to 10 hen.  >> i don't want to pull the rug  from under u.s. Economic  exceptionalism.  >> you're starting to at 3%.  >> i think we are investing in  the economies of tomorrow in  the growth drivers of tomorrow.  >> the government?  >> no, the private sector,  everything else.  if you push this economy --  >> the private sector is not  what causes inflation.  >> joe, if you push this  economy into recession, you  would not just lose current  standard of living, you lose  future standard of living.  2.5 to 3 is what i said.  you immediately went to 3. As  long as inflation expectations  are stable, you can navigate.  >> better buy some bitcoin,  mohamed.  >> he did.  >> not enough.  >> none of us did.  damn.  >> what do you think of the  michael barr situation?  >> so i think that is a -- that  is someone taking one for the  fed.  i think he stepped down to  protect the fed to again help  na",

                ">>> THE TIK TOK BAN IS SAID TO  TAKE EFFECT ON JANUARY 19  UNLESS THE SUPREME COURT TAKES  ACTION.  JOINING US FOR THE LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS GOING ON UNTIL THE  DEADLINE IS THE SEO CONSULTING  FIRM KRISTOF AND COMPANY.  SHE HAS WORKED ON THE HILL FOR  JOHN McCAIN AND IN SILICON  VALLEY FOR GOOGLE, UBER, AND  SALESFORCE.  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.  WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN THE  NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS IN YOUR  VIEW?  >> WHAT WILL HAPPEN, IN MY VIEW  IS THE SUPREME COURT'S WILL  UPHOLD THE BAN.  IT IS A WELL-WRITTEN LAW.  THE FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENTS  ARE TOTALLY FAILED.  THEY HAVE NO REAL REASON NOT TO  OF BEEN.  PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS WEIGHED IN  WITH AMICUS BRIEF ASKING THEM  TO DELAY.  I THINK IT GOES FORWARD ON  JANUARY 19.  >> WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN AT THAT  POINT?  >> WE DON'T KNOW IF EXACTLY  WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE FOR  USERS.  IT MEANS THAT THE APP STORES  CAN NO LONGER LET PEOPLE  DOWNLOAD IT.  APPLE AND GOOGLE.  YOU WILL SELECT TIK TOK ON YOUR  PHONE, WHETHER OR NOT IT WILL  WORK IS TO BE SEEN.  IT IS UP TO TIK TOK WITH WHAT  THEY DO WITH USER DATA.  YOU WILL HAVE A WORSE AND WORSE  PRODUCT EXPERIENCE.  YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UPGRADE  IT.  IT COULD JUST GO DARK, WE DON'T  KNOW.  >> THIS HAPPENS, YOU GO ONE  MONTH AFTER THAT, AND IT IS  OKAY AGAIN, CAN HUMPTY DUMPTY  GO BACK TOGETHER AGAIN?  >> IT COULD BE PAUSED BY THE  PRESIDENT AFTER HE IS  INAUGURATED.  THERE IS A PROVISION FOR A 90  DAY PAUSE.  IF HE SAYS, LISTEN, THEY'RE  LOOKING TO THE SOFT, HE COULD  PUT A PAUSE ON IT.  THIS REPORT IS THE HIGHEST  COURT OF THE LAND.  TO UNDO THIS, THEY WOULD NEED A  NEW LAW FROM CONGRESS.  >> I THINK YOU WOULD DO THAT,  RIGHT?  HE IS READY TO ANNEX CANADA,  THIS DOES NOT SEEM LIKE MUCH OF  A STRETCH.  >> MAKE A POINT, HE HAS BEEN  BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS LIKE THE  GULF OF MEXICO.  ALSO, IMMIGRATION, TARIFFS, AND  NOW THEY TALK ABOUT PARDONS  THIS CANNOT BE THE TOP OF THE  PRIORITY LIST.  HE COULD HIT PAUSE AS IF HE  COULD GET A LEGISLATIVE  SOLUTION OR NEGOTIATE  SOMETHING.  YOU WANT TO TALK DIRECTLY WITH  THE CHAIRMAN TO DO THAT.  HE IS INDICATING THAT HE WANTS  TO DO THAT.  HE HAS 14 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON  TIK TOK.  >> HE DOESN'T LIKE IT BECAUSE  IT HELPED.  BARON TRUMP TOLD HIM, YOU HAVE  TO DO TIK TOK.  >> HE HAS ALL OF THAT BITCOIN  FTX MONEY.  >> HE'S GOT ALL THAT BITCOIN  MONEY.  FTFC.  I FORGOT ALREADY.  >> FTX.  >> YEAH, THAT'S WHAT.  TOO MANY LETTERS.  IS IT -- ARE THEY STEALING  EVERYTHING THAT THERE IS TO  KNOW ABOUT OUR YOUTH IN THIS  COUNTRY, AND USING IT TO  SUBVERT THE FUTURE OF THE  UNITED STATES OR NOT?  THAT'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.  THAT WAS THE WHOLE IDEA.  IT HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING.  AND IF SO, THEN IT DOESN'T  MATTER WHETHER IT HELPED WIN AN  ELECTION.  IT'S AN INSIDIOUS THING THAT  PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE AROUND.  WHICH IS IT?  >> WELL ONE THING THAT WE DON'T  KNOW IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN  THOSE NATIONAL SECURITY  BRIEFINGS.  SO WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED, A  NUMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT  AGENTS WERE SKEPTICAL.  THEY SAID I'M SUPPORTING THIS  LAW.  PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SEEN THOSE  BRIEFINGS.  WE HAVE NOT SEEN THEM.  IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT THE  CCP HAS SHOWN THEY ARE  INTERESTED IN, AND ACTIVE IN  MANIPULATING PUBLIC DISCORD IN  THE UNITED STATES.  NOW THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SEEMS  TO SHRUG THIS OFF.  170MILLION PEOPLE DON'T MIND  HAVING A SURVEILLANCE DEVICE IN  THEIR POCKET, IT SEEMS, BUT  THEY HAVEN'T SEEN ALL THE  EVIDENCE.  WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT, MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS HAVE, BOTH PRESIDENT  BIDEN AND TRUMP HAVE SEEN THAT  INFORMATION.  >> NICKY IS IT POSSIBLE THAT  ALL THE PHONES ARE SENDING  INFORMATION TO THE DRONES?  >> IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY ARE  VIOLATING TERMS OF SERVICE FROM  THE APP STORES AND COLLECTING  THINGS ON ALL OF OUR PHONES.  ANYONE IN WASHINGTON, WHERE I'M  BASED WHO WORKS IN NATIONAL  SECURITY DOES NOT TOUCH TIKTOK.  THEY BELIEVE THAT IT COULD  SCRAPE INFORMATION.  I THINK MOST TEENAGERS DON'T  CARE.  >> RIGHT.  THEY DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHINA'S GOING  TO GET FROM LOOKING AT WHAT  TEENS TALK ABOUT.  NOT A WHOLE LOT.  IF THEY DO LOOK AT IT, THEY  PROBABLY SAY, WE DON'T HAVE TO  DO ANYTHING.  U.S. IS GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY.  GO AHEAD.  >> ONE LAST THING IS PRESIDENT  TRUMP HAS SAID OVER AND OVER IS  ONE OF HIS BIG CONCERNS IS THIS  IS A BOONE TO INSTAGRAM.  MARK ZUCKERBERG IS THE BIGGEST  BENEFICIARY OF THIS BAN.  THERE'S A REASON WE'RE SEEING  HIM ON BENDED KNEE THIS WEEK.  I THINK THERE'S A REASON F",

                "Slowing to 4.6%.  that's the slowest pace of  gains since july of 2021.  for those who moved jobs, pay  growth was roughly in line with  last month.  that's at 7.1%.  for more on the adp data, i  want to bring in neil  richardson, ad p's chief  economist, who has been keeping  these numbers secret.  what do you think?  how should we actually think  about this?  the market is doing a little  bit better actually on the back  of this.  but that may be a bad news is  good news situation.  >> it's hard to know when you  incorporate the fed.  from our perspective, what  we've seen all year is very  stable hiring.  we saw a pick up in october.  this december report definitely  represents a down shift from  what we saw earlier in the  quarter.  but it's still a solid number.  pockets of weakness are  something to watch.  manufacturing shed jobs for  three consecutive months.  that's concerning.  this is a sector that could  benefit from a rate cut.  what's doing the heavy lifting  in services is no longer  leisure and hospitality.  we think that game is over.  it's really healthcare.  healthcare is not cyclical.  it's tied to, i think,  demographic hiring.  so you take these two, the good  sector and the service sector.  service is being driven by the  democrat demographics.  manufacture i think very much  focuses on the short term.  >> if you were sitting here in  three months though, from now,  based on these trends, what do  you see happening?  because i think that's what  we're really trying to  understand.  >> you know, first of all, i  think when you really want to  know what's going on in the  labor market, you have to shift  from jobs to wages.  because wages are going to tell  the story of what the fed will  do next.  what we saw was a step down in  wage growth, particularly for  job sayers.  4.6%.  that's a very slow pace of job  growth -- i mean, excuse me,  wage growth.  but not slow enough to be  consistent with a 2% inflation  target.  so that means one of two  things.  either wage growth has to come  down significantly over the  next three months for the fed  to feel comfortable cutting  rates, or we're going to get  into the situation where the  fed has to pause and wait for  the labor market to come along  with this rate cut.  >> did you hear christopher  waller's comments this morning  that he's going to be giving a  speech a little later today?  i was a little surprised that  he still seems to be leaving  the door open to several more  rate cuts this year.  >> given the uncertainty on the  policy front, i think leaving  the door open is a wise move  for the federal reserve.  honestly, they've been leaving  the door open being data  dependent is basically saying  i'm opening the doors and the  windows and seeing if there's a  next data point.  >> although it feels like the  market has been expecting these  rate cuts and they've been  trying to maybe talk themself  out of a position where they  are expected to cut it every  rate meeting.  this seems like it was a swing  back in the other direction.  >> six months ago, i think the  foregone conclusion was that  the fed would move like the fed  has in the past, which is  moderately and consistently,  every single meeting was a rate  cut.  they've channeled that.  that might not be the case.  there may be pauses on the way.  this has been a bumpy  deceleration in wage growth.  i believe it will be a bumpy  deceleration in the interest  rate as well.  >> bumpy, because the data has  been bumpy too.  >> absolutely.  we've seen pockets of strength  and pockets of weakness.  we saw a big surge i",

                "The answer, royal caribbean  icon of the seas the ship is  1196 feet long and 219 feet  wide.  >>> speaker mike johnson is  looking to pass a  reconciliation package through  congress by april.  join us on the gop game plan  and present electrons agenda is  house republican policy  committee chair, kevin hern.  congressman,  it is good to see  you.  will be one or two at this  point?  what is your best guess?  >> what is the issue today, we  have been given the gift of the  opportunity to be in this place  to pass a reconciliation bill  and do things like extend the  tax cuts, and secure the  southern border, get energy  dominance back where was 4  years ago.  we have not been given as a  gift of time.  we need to get these tax cuts  extended by the end of the year  for every single business will  see a rise in causes money  comes blowing back to  washington, d.c. If you look  back, the fastest way to get  that done in the house is one  bill as trump says, one big  beautiful bill so we get  everybody's interest taken care  of as we move forward.  >> that would include a debt  limit increase, as well as $2.5  trillion in net cuts to  spending.  is that possible?  for we believe so.  we have more spending cuts  aligned up than that.  that seems to be the middle of  the road or on the low end.  it ranges from 2 trillion to 5  trillion.  we are looking at releasing  lands to be drilled on,  permitting processes that are  really important, and these are  things that are impactful.  a lot of the money that you saw  the biden administration, or  saw them spend on illegal  immigration, was president  trump order policies, that  would slow down or stop.  a lot of spending cuts that we  could pull in to offset the  cost of extending the tax cuts.  as for we go through the same  process where someone decides on what is a budget  reconciliation, i remember the  democrats loved this pv uses a  lot recently.  if someone has to decide what  can go in there, right?  for they do.  the budget reconciliation  process was part of the 1974  budget control act.  it was a failsafe if you cannot  come through the budget and the  authorizations and  appropriations to hit september  30 each year.  they gave another avenue.  it requires very narrow  language.  as being impactful to the  budget.  that is is in a process,  c.d.o.t.  to have the 60 vote rule on the  filibuster.  the commentary in the senate  will control what gets into the  reconciliation framework.  and the house, the ways and  means and tax quality  subcommittee is that on will be  working make sure that the tax  cuts fit into the  reconciliation process, along  with energy and commerce, and  10 other committees.  >> can you guarantee the  parliamentarian will let all of  the border security provisions  in there as well?  >> not all, because we looked  at hr 2 that the house and did  pass back in march 2023,  overwhelmingly, in a very  narrow margin, we had a three  vote margin, now we have about  two.  we are getting accustomed to  working with the 99% approval  ratings to get a bill passed.  there are things in there that  are not impactful to the  budget, they are more policy.  you cannot pass policy in a  budget reconciliation process.  went to strip out those ideas  that were in there with the  bills that it pass to the  senate to make sure we get only  things in there that will have  a budget impact.  for if it was two bills,  something to be in the second  bill?  then you would need 60?  how would you do that?  you can do that?  >> if you have the second  reconciliation bill, it might  be something, things you might  have to look at the did not get  into the first bill. You find a  way to present it to the  parliamentarian where they  might accept it.  that's why so important to get  one bill done early and start  working on that and try to get  it done by memorial day. This  is a lot of work, as is of the  opening, we are not given the  gift of time.  all tax cuts expire on december  31 of this year.  every single american and small  business will see a small tax  increase if we don't get it  done.  it is important.  this should be a bipartisan  process.  the democrats should all people  have tax increases.  we are working hard.  we will see what happens.  for where will the corporate  scope?  is there some of for that?  to go to next year? is it  possible to do that?  >> is it possible to go from 21  to 15 on the corporate tax rate  just for domestic producers?  is that would be in there?  >> we want to look at it, that  is an additional campaign  conversation that the president  had, just like no tax on tips  and no tax on social security.  those are things we had to  figure out if they can fit n.  we will do that as we get the  legislation moving forward to  going to the reconciliation  package and see what fits in  there, and how we square.  cbo committee on taxation look  at those.  those are important as we move  forward.  we are working passionately to  do as much as we possibly can  on president trump's campaign  promises.  for in terms of pay for some of  you know if there is any  agreement or areas you think  you can get agreement on pay  force to make up for the  givebacks and taxes?  how do we do that in a balanced  fashion?  >> we saw some of that is in hr  1 last year.  the republican house did pass  that, the number one priority,  which was energy dominance.  that is something that  president trump work on.  we heard president trump across  all the campaign trail city  went to across america, talking  about the way we would fix our  way out of this going forward,  using minerals under our feet,  oil and gas, and other mining  opportunities that we have.  looking at how we can release  those, we are very dependent on  the congo for cobalt and china  for processing that coba",

                "Latest, the doctor says while  the bidens last-minute $306  million package to find bird  flu is welcome news, there is  much more to be done when  president-elect trump takes  office.  joining is now the fda  commissioner.  he is also a pfizer board  member and a cnbc contributor.  scott, let's talk this through.  we talk you and last week, you  said  you were not that  concerned about bird flu  becoming a huge threat for  humans.  has that changed at all?  is your take changed since we  heard of the first human that  died of bird flu?  >> that has not changed.  this is a low probability risk.  it could be a high impact  event, and the thing we want to  take steps to mitigate.  there are things we can do and  could have been doing, going  boards reduce the risk that  this could spread into humans.  we need to be testing more on  farms to turn over the cases  and isolate cows that become  infected and chicken flocks as  well.  we need to do more to help  farmers protect dairy workers  be providing swabs to dairy  workers so they can diagnose  themselves.  the thing you worry about is  people becoming co-infected  with this virus and seasonal  influenza.  you get the combination of the  viruses, that would enable the  virus to spread more easily.  that's what happened in 2009.  that was the combination  between the swine flu and  seasonal influenza.  to happen in a pig and then it  became a pandemic strain.  want to mitigate the risks.  you want to do more on the  therapeutic side.  we did stockpile tamiflu, but  not the whole range of  antivirals that could be  effective.  if you look in the journal  medicine in the case reports  two weeks ago, one patient  became very sick in louisiana  canada.  the strength became resistant  to tamiflu as virus continue to  progress in those two patients.  you want to have multiple  antivirals. We have not done  that.  there is a lot we could be  doing to mitigate the risk that  we have not done.  or we have done a late in the  process.  >> why do you think that is?  for there was a tug-of-war  between human health  regulators, public health  regulators, cdc, and other  health agencies and  agricultural officials that felt this would burn out on the  farms.  they did not want to take steps  that would be costly and  burdensome to the farmers.  this is very structural. This  happens all the time between  human health and animal health  regulators.  i had challenges getting my  inspectors on produce farms for  example we had outbreaks of e.  coli are response.  they were reluctant to let  federal regulators on the farms  to isolate what fields were  contaminated.  you see the ension play out  all the time.  there really was a presumption  among the animal health  officials that this would burn  its way through the dairy herd  and eventually be extinguished.  that has not happened.  it has become endemic.  we are seeing it in migratory  birds.  the two patient became very  sick, the one in canada and the  one in louisiana have the  strain that was in migratory  birds.  i am speculating here, but it  is likely because they got sick  by inhaling dry feces from the  birds.  so far, the infections on the  dairy farms have been  conjunctivitis.  it is not getting into the  lower airways.  >> do you think that the state  and local officials and the  animal control officials have  changed their mind about the  concern level here?  if they don't, is there  anything that will get done?  >> there are indications that  they have changed their mind  that the state level.  we see states doing aggressive  testing of dairy cattle.  we have also seen the  implementation in the last  month, in december, a full  testing of milk at the federal  level.  animal health officials  recognized they needed to take  aggressive steps on the farms.  the other thing we could be  doing is increasing the  compensation for affected dairy  farms.  the farmers not be bearing the  brunt of doing the right thing.  they are on the front lines.  they should not bear the  economic rent -- bronx of  calling animals and testing for ",

                "TRUMP RENEWING HIS CALL TO GAIN  U.S. CONTROL OF GREENLAND, ALSO  THE PANAMA CANAL, MAYBE EVEN  CANADA. YESTERDAY HE DECLINED TO RULE  OUT USING MILITARY AND ECONOMIC  COERCION TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. JOINING US RIGHT NOW WITH MORE  ON ALL OF THIS MARK CAPUTO, A  SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER FOR  AXIOS. GOOD MORNING TO YOU. WE WERE DEBATING A LITTLE BIT OF THIS EARLIER IN THE BROADCAST,  MARK, AND I THINK WE'RE ALL  TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH OF THIS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE  SERIOUSLY, HOW MUCH WE'RE  SUPPOSED TO TAKE AS SORT OF  TRUMP DOCTRINE, NEGOTIATING  POSTURE OF SORTS. HOW DO YOU VIEW IT? >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS  SAID IN 2016 IS NOT TO TAKE  TRUMP OR THAT HIS VOTERS DIDN'T  ALWAYS TAKE TRUMP LITERALLY,  THEY TOOK HIM FIGURATIVELY. I THINK BY NOW WE HAD 12, 13  YEARS OF THIS WE SHOULD REALIZE  IT'S BOTH. YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIM LITERALLY,  YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIM  FIGURATIVELY, YOU HAVE TO TAKE  HIM SERIOUSLY AND SOMETIMES YOU  HAVE TO TAKE HIM UNSERIOUSLY. SO THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR  QUESTION IS I DON'T KNOW, I  DON'T THINK ANY OF US KNOWS. THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE'RE GOING  TO ACQUIRE GREENLAND WHEN WE  HAVE TRILLIONS IN DEBT AND A  HUGE BUDGET DEFICIT IS PRETTY  SLIM CONSIDERING THE NARROW  MARGINS IN CONGRESS BECAUSE,  AFTER ALL, CONGRESS WILL  PROBABLY NEED TO DO SOMETHING  ABOUT TAKING OVER NEW TERRITORY. BUT NEVERTHELESS, TRUMP WANTS TO DO THIS IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR  FORM AND UNLIKE ADMINISTRATIONS  AND CAMPAIGNS PAST, DONALD TRUMP HAS A STAFF AND STRUCTURE AROUND HIM THAT SAYS, WELL, IF DONALD  TRUMP SAYS IT, THEN WE WILL TRY  TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.  >> HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH? I WONDER WHAT THE BLUE BOOK IS. AND YOU REMEMBER --  >> I HAVE NO IDEA.  >> IF IT'S NOT THAT MUCH MONEY,  I DISAGREE THAT THE BUDGET  DEFICIT WOULDN'T ALLOW IT. IT CERTAINLY ALLOWS US TO SPEND  A LOT OF MONEY ON OTHER THINGS,  LIKE HELP FOR UKRAINE, HELP FOR  OTHER PLACES. >> SURE.  >> WE SPENT -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE SPENT ON ALASKA, BUT IT  WAS -- IT WAS CALLED A FOLLY AT  THE TIME, I THINK -- DO YOU  REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS? IT WAS IN THE MILLIONS. I DON'T EACH ANY IT WAS IN THE  BILLIONS WHEN IT HAPPENED. ONE OF THE GREAT PURCHASES,  OBVIOUSLY, OF ALL TIME. GREENLAND, IF IT COULD BE  DONE -- IF YOU COULD -- YOU  KNOW, WE TALK ABOUT COERCION,  MAKE THEM AN OFFER THEY CAN'T  REFUSE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY? >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WELL, IN THE CASE OF SEWARD,  BUYING SQUA, CZARIST RUSSIA  WANTED TO SELL IT. IN THE CASE OF GREENLAND THEY  DON'T WANT TO.  >> $7 MILLION.  >> I WILL TAKE TWO, RIGHT? >> EXACTLY. >> BUT IN THE IT'S NOT JUST  WHETHER WE CAN AFFORD IT OR NOT, IT'S WHETHER CONGRESS THINKS WE  CAN AFFORD IT OR NOT. THERE ARE NARROW MARGINS IN  CONGRESS. IT'S JUST DIFFICULT TO SEE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT DONALD  TRUMP ISN'T SERIOUS ABOUT IT OR, YOU KNOW, GRADING ON A DONALD  TRUMP CURVE WHETHER HE'S  SERIOUSLY MUSING ABOUT IT, BUT  WE SHOULD TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND  ONCE HE BEGAN TALKING ABOUT THIS AGAIN -- REMEMBER HE DISCUSSED  THIS IN 2018 AND 2019. PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE HIM  SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT. >> MARC, LET'S WALK THROUGH THE  VARIOUS COMPONENT PARTS OF WHAT  WAS SAID. SO THERE IS THE GREENLAND PIECE  WHICH IT SOUNDS LIKE IF HE COULD PURCHASE IT, HE WOULD. THE QUESTION IS IF HE COULDN'T  PURCHASE IT OR COULDN'T AFFORD  TO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WOULD HE USE MILITARY FORCE TO SOMEHOW GET IT? THAT'S ONE PIECE. THEN THERE'S THE PANAMA CANAL  AND THEN THERE'S CANADA AS THE  51st STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS EVEN  REALISTIC THERE? AND LET'S EVEN TALK ABOUT THE  POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF ALL OF THIS, WHICH IS TO SAY THE WAY  CANADA, FOR EXAMPLE, OR EVEN THE FOLKS IN PANAMA RIGHT NOW ARE  REACTING TO ALL OF THIS. >> THEY'RE -- I LIVE IN MIAMI. MY COUNTY COMMISSIONER, KEVIN  CABRERA IS ABOUT TO BE THE  AMBASSADOR FOR THE UNITED STATES TO PANAMA AND SO HE'S GOING TO  HAVE HIS HANDS FULL. I DO THINK THAT OUT OF THE THREE SCENARIOS YOU LAID OUT HERE  TRUMP IS MOST CONCERNED ABOUT  PANAMA. NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF CHINA'S  PRESENCE AS A GLOBAL POWER TRADE SUPER POWER, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE DARION GAP, THE ONLY LAND  BRIDGE CONNECTING SOUTH AMERICA  WITH CENTRAL AND NORTH AMERICA,  THEREFORE. THAT HAS BEEN A MAJOR MIGRANT  THROUGH WAY. SO DONALD TRUMP WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT TRADE, CHINA AND  IMMIGRATION, IS LOOKING AT  PANAMA AND IS VERY CONCERNED  ABOUT IT. I THINK OUT OF THE THREE WE'VE  DISCUSSED HERE THAT IS THE MOST  LIKELY FOR HIM TO DEVOTE MORE  TIME, POLICY AND RESOURCES  TOWARD.  >> WHAT ABOUT THE CANADA PIECE,  THOUGH? BECAUSE THEY ARE OUR NEIGHBOR,  THEY HAVE BEEN AN ALLY, A GREAT  ALLY, AND THERE ARE NOW  CONCERNS -- YOU READ THE PAPERS  IN CANADA, TURN ON THE TVs  THERE, I WAS READING -- OR  SEEING SOME VIDEO THAT WAS  COMING ACROSS ON SOCIAL MEDIA  AND THEY'RE -- YOU KNOW, IT  SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE APOPLECTIC  ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING.  >> I IMAGINE THEY ARE. CANADA FOR ITS ENTIRE HISTORY  HAS LIVED IN FEAR OF ITS  BARBARIC BROTHER TO THE SOUTH,  YOU UNITED STATES, INVADING IT  AND TAKING IT OVER. IT OPTED NOT TO BECOME PART OF  THE UNITED STATES EVEN THOUGH A  NUMBER OF OUR EARLY FOUNDING  FATHERS AND OUR EARLY PRESIDENTS WANTED IT TO. THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER OF  PANAMA -- OR BETTER SAID OF  CANADA WHOSE LAST NAME IS FRENCH SO I THEREFORE CAN'T PRONOUNCE  IT BECAUSE I, TOO, AM ONE OF  THESE BARBARIANS HE HAS EVEN  DISCOUNTED IT. THIS ONE IS HARDER TO SEE OUT OF ALL OF THEM. THE GREENLAND PIECE IS HARD TO  SEE, THE PANAMA IS LESS HARD TO  SEE OUT OF ALL THREE.  >> YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE  PEOPLE AROUND HIM WANTING HIM TO ACCOMPLISH THESE THINGS. THERE WAS A SENSE IN 2016 THERE  WERE PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHO  DIDN'T WANT TO HELP HIM  ACCOMPLISH THINGS THAT HE TALKED ABOUT.  >> CORRECT.  >> THEY WERE ALMOST BLOCKING OR  PREVENTING CERTAIN THINGS OR  SLOW WALKING THINGS. HOW DIFFERENT IS THAT TODAY AND  HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THAT? >> I WROTE IN AXIOS ON MONDAY  THAT HIS INCOMING CHIEF OF STAFF WAS HIS CAMPAIGN CO-MANAGER  SUSIE WILES STUCK WITH HIM  THROUGH THICK AND THIN. SHE HAS THE UNDERSTANDING OF  LETTING TRUMP BE TRUMP AND  TRYING TO EXECUTE ON HIS VISION  AND HIRING PEOPLE WHO ARE LOYAL  TO HIM, LOYAL TO HIS MISSION AND BELIEVE IN GETTING THINGS DONE  FOR HIM AND NOT UNDERMINING HIM. THAT'S WHY, FOR INSTANCE, WE  HAVEN'T SEEN WHAT WE WOULD HAVE  SEEN IN THE PAST, WHICH WOULD  HAVE BEEN ANONYMOUS STAFF LEAKS  SAYING, OH, MY GOD, THIS GUY IS  CRAZY. THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT. NOT HEARING THAT ANYMORE. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT  WE HAVE TO TAKE THE GREENLAND,  THE CANADA AND PANAMA PIECES ",

                "Wharton school of business.  he's also a cnbc contributor.  thank you for joining us on the  show today.  >> happy to be here.  >> i want to get your initial  reaction to what we heard from  mark zuckerberg.  he mentioned that the steps  they will be taking will be  similar to x. What was your  take on what he had to say?  >> similar kind of take, frank.  i think what we're seeing here  is not super surprising, we're  looking at a tech company who  is basically saying listen, we  have to make sure that we are  not in regulatory harms way  here and so it's been very  clear that the president-elect  has stated very clearly that  listen, you are with us or  you're not.  so there is this retaliatory,  sort of flavor out there that i  think many of the tech  companies responding to.  it's not surprising, because i  think it is pretty normal for  most companies to say, you  know, when a new presidential  administration comes in, we  want to make sure we are  aligned for sure.  what is critical here, frank,  is the idea that this is really  the critical question that  facebook and meta has been  facing for a long time, which  is to say listen, are we a news  platform or are we a vehicle  where information flows  through?  i think we're about to get our  answer on that.  >> all right, so we're spending  a lot of time looking what the  possible motivations are,  whether trying to line itself  with the incoming  administration or be more like  x. I want to ask you, someone  who is a marketing expert, is  there a business reason to do  this?  there's been a public relations  impact.  is there a business reason to  do all this?  >> there absolutely is a  business reason to do this,  frank.  let my lay this out quickly.  i think a couple of things.  it costs a lot of money to  police free speech, free speech  in the social media platforms.  you have to pay monitors, you  have to set up automated  algorithms to check across a  wide area of high scaled users,  millions, billions of users and  things of that nature.  so that's a cost.  that's a real expense that you  can scale back if you're doing  this.  so from that perspective,  economically, that also makes  sense.  i think it also makes sense  from the perspective of the  idea that at least for half the  population, as you know, there  is too much of this free  speech, you know, there isn't  enough of this free speech  advocacy and too much wokism.  those consumers will say, you  know what?  i may be more -- i may look at  the platform now more  favorablely because now i see  it as aligned with my own views  on the ability to say whatever  it is you want to say out  there.  so i think there's two reasons.  there's a consumer reason that  says those advocates of free  speech will be more attracted  to the platform.  those operational costs that  could be reduced, frank, are  significant in terms of what  meta is facing.  >> thinking about 95% of the  revenues from ads.  how do you see it impacting  that part of the business?  not fact checking is cost  cutting, but what about the  revenues coming in?  do you see the fact they are  shifting more towards x and i  want your take on how x is  operating now.  if they are shifting toward x,  what does that mean for future  revenue growth?  >> it's a great question,  frank.  there are two forces here that  are going on.  the first will be, there will  be a group of enterprise  organizations that will say, we  can't be on that platform.  we saw that with x, ibm and  other companies that said hey,  we can't allow our messages to  be coinciding with other things  that might be seen as hate  speech or might be detrimental  to our brand.  there is that, sort of, that  reaction that is going to say,  you know, we'll pull back.  some companies will pull back  and say, we don't want to be on  the platform advertising.  however, there will be  additional counteraffect of  that, which will be companies  that say, we do want to be  there because they may brand  themselves or see themselves,  frank, as kind of this antiwoke  kind of brand.  parallel economy kinds of  brands.  those brands are probably going  to be more attractive.  we'll see some companies  dropping off because of the  effects to their brands and  their ideological points of  view.  but we'll also see some brands  coming on board more so as  advertising opportunities  because of the fact they see  alignment with meta's new  policies in terms of scaling  back these different  approaches.  >> you know, interesting  intersection between commerce  and culture when it comes to  this decision from meta.  i have one last question for  you.  you work down there in  philadelphia.  where ",

                "Let's bring in megan chu.  megan, good to see you.  >> good morning, frank, thanks  for having me.  >> megan, how do you see today,  this week shaping up?  what's your word of the day?  >> yeah, so i think my word of  the day is quality.  i think that really describes  the environment that we are  dealing with in at least the  first quarter, probably the  first half of this year.  the way i think about it, and  redefine quality is companying  generating really strong,  sustainable earnings while also  carrying low levels of  leverage.  so, the two most likely  scenarios are inflation  continues to come down.  the economy softens a little  bit, and the fed cuts much more  than what we are expecting.  in that environment, where you  get a softer growth outlook,  you really want those companies  that are generating  sustainable, strong earnings.  but if we're wrong and the  market is more right and rates  stay elevated for longer and  the fed is not cutting very  much, if at all next year, then  i think you really need to be  focusing on companies that do  not rely on interest rate  sensitive debt or their  borrowing needs and higher  quality companies tend to carry  much higher levels of overall  cash.  i think it's a win/win.  that's why higher quality is a  theme we're focused on.  >> i want to go back to your  base case.  i think people now are thinking  it's two cuts, maybe just one  cut.  inflation appears to be  stickier than we thought it  was.  on your base case at least,  where do you get confidence  that inflation is going down,  especially after the read  yesterday, we saw companies are  preparing for tariffs and  prices are going up.  >> well, in all honesty, and  full disclosure, yesterday's  data did not work toward our  base case, where we not only  had pryer prices paid in the  services, but we got an uptick  in the jolt survey, and what  we're working on the inflation  front is really the underlying  price pressures.  if you look at categories of  housing and then everything  housing.  housing continues to come down.  it's stickier than we would  like.  if you look at the categories  outside of housing, that has  been at or below the fed's  target for a number of months  now, and we just do not see the  conditions that would really be  necessary, the inflations stay  here or even reaccelerate,  which is the fed's concern.  labor market --  >> meghan, i want to make time  to talk about this.  your pick for today.  what is your pick and why?  >> my pick is banks.  this is another sort of, i  think win/win for the year  ahead.  banks were a key part of the  broadening story we saw in the  second half of last year.  we expect rates to stay  elevated.  we think short rates will come  down.  you'll get really a nice rate  environment and a steeper curve  for banks.  the thing to watch wil",

                "And owns palantir, gentleman,  good morning, great to have you  both here.  maalik, i'm going to start off  with you.  one of the issues you have, is  the evaluation of palantir, at  150 times.  is there any other big issue  with this company, other than  this really elevated  evaluation?  >> to be very honest with you,  first of all, good morning.  to be honest, we think about  palantir's business, it is one  of the only ai places out  there.  the company business is great,  the u.s. Commercial side of the  business is actually doing  really well, and firing on all  cylinders.  our issue with palantir, as a  stock has been the evaluation.  that's what we highlighted over  the last few quarters, the  evaluation is getting out of  hand.  especially if you think about  trying to take into the stock  price, those are some very  optimistic assumptions.  >> derek, i want to come over  to you.  palantir was a black box, it  wasn't clear what they did.  now they expanded out to  commercial work.  we're talking about this  evaluation, and just the  potential they could have with  u.s. And global companies  looking to upgrade themselves  with ai.  do you believe the evaluation  is over stretched as well?  >> oh, well thank you for  having me.  we at krane shares, while the  current are optimistic.  palantir could become the gold  operating system for ai, we're  talking about potential  trillion dollar market.  now palantir is the key holding  in kraneshares.  infrastructure, and ai coin to  applications.  what is really exciting is how  the deployment is really taking  off in the enterprise world.  seeing real benefits.  better efficiency, and business  creating ai adoption, palantir  stands out in this space.  their ai platform, their system  is a game changer.  it brings together data, logic,  and action, in a way both  humans and ai can actually work  together.  but the ai platform is  topnotch.  security features, which is  crucial for companies to adopt  ai safely.  also palantir's business, the  trump administration is really  prioritizing efficiency and  digital transformation.  this could be a startup trend,  potentially bringing palantir  in the future.  >> maalik, back over to you.  evaluation, you're expecting  revenue growth and other things  to kind of meet that  evaluation.  do you agree with derek had to  say, this company has more  upside than we have seen last  year?  340% gain.  because derek seems to be  saying they have proprietary  software that other people  can't quite match.  >> first of all, i think i  agree with derek's point about  them having competitive  advantage.  when we look at our method, we  do, now as it relates to, as  you said, evaluations are  forward-looking, i would again  sort of put that question back,  what do you need to believe  about the top or the margin  profile for this business over  a five, ten-year time period  for you to get $70 or $80, as  it was illustrating a few days  ago, dollar per share  evaluation.  i tried to conduct a reverse  dcf, where you bake in what  assumptions would get you to  the stock price.  and the numbers i got would  have put palantir ahead of all  the software company asks out  there.  you have a ten-year around 30%.  you would have margin profile  gap, operating north f 55%.  if that is the assumption you  have over a ten-year period,  you could buy the stock at $80.  but when we're looking at our  own assumption, again, they are  very optimistic.  they factor ",

                "You and i used to talk  transports.  now you moved on to  industrials.  >> happy new year.  >> why don't we start with your  top pick.  parker, shares up 39% over the  last year.  why is this company your top  pick?  >> a high quality company.  50% revenues are exposed to  short cycle industrial  exposure.  30% of the business is  aerospace.  they have a balance sheet that  is prime to make further  acquisitions, about $12 billion  of capitol.  so, it gives us the balance of  secular growth via the  aerospace, and creative  acquisition, as well as  exposure to a short cycle  inflection, which we expect at  ubs over the next five, six  months.  we have to be patient about  that.  companiesstart reporting  results in january, we're not  going to be pointing to a  massive acceleration in short  cycle.  the leading indicators are  pointing in that direction,  whether it's small business  optimism.  so we're optimistic here that  if you had me back on in march  or april, we're talking about a  different tune.  >> all right, you just  mentioned manufacturing.  that has been lagging, we'll  say, i think there was one  month that was an outlier,  tipped over to expack.  mostly in contraction.  when do you see that turning  around and how important is  that to names?  are there other tail wednesdays  or manufacturing a key metric  to watch?  >> you're absolutely right.  the industrial economy has been  in resession, if you can  believe it or not, for the last  two plus years.  it's the longest stretch of  contraction.  you would expect that to  improve at some point.  interest rates matter.  there's an inverse  relationship.  the election is positive and  the psychology as you can see  in small business optimism.  so, it's a short cycle, low  visibility.  we'll see.  again, manufacturing is close  to 50.  it's been below 50 for two  years.  small business optimism saw a  surge from november to  december, and so we're quite  optimistic that over the next  couple months, the industrial  economy, as measured by the  manufacturing, will go from  contraction to growth.  the question is, what's the  magnitude of that improvement?  we'll see that over the course  of the next six months.  government policy has a lot to  do with that.  we are optimistic.  the other tail wednesday is ai  and data centers.  a lot of that infrastructure  that needs to be put up is  exposed to electric components.  that's another huge tail wind  for the industry.  >> we were talking about  quantum computing.  is there a tie-in with quantum  computing and industrials right  now?  >> there's a tie-in between ai  and industrials.  you can see with train  technologies.  there is an exposure, more  directly, i would call that  honey well, it's a 54% stake in  a private quantum computing  company.  we'll see what the evaluation  of that, the last evaluation  round was $2 billion.  there's about $4 per share of  value baked into honey well's  iyty equity value.  it needs massive amount of  infrastructure.  this is da",

                "Welcome back to squawk box.  welcome back to marcus.  we are looking at her chief  investment strategist.  good morning.  we have been wanting this  uniquely strange situation.  quantum computing in the  context of nvidia, and other  a.i.  darlings, and  the bitcoin risk  on or rest off ramp.  >> it has been a struggle.  it makes sense.  when you look at investor  positioning, they are at an  impasse.  you have the same percentage of  bulls versus bears.  there are two factors battling  it out right now.  on the one hand, you have a  positive story of artificial  intelligence that is carrying  itself into 2025.  yet the story of solid earnings  we expect for the quarter.  that has been taken into context of what we could get from the  fed and the new trump  administration.  that is creating some  volatility.  given that set up and the  markets have not removed enough  risk just yet, that is what we  had to go through.  let's go through this battle.  >> that is a euphemism for go  down?  >> that's right.  >> we have seen a bit of that  at the end of last year.  we saw the markets pulled back  2% or 3%.  we saw hedge funds at shorts.  we saw systematic investors  going through a wave of selling  and some private clients may  have done that as well.  i don't think we have seen  enough of that.  we are not at oversold levels.  we might have a share of new  one-month flows of the s&p that  is higher than normal, but i  don't think we have seen  enough.  i can say, this is the time to  jump into the market.  we have to be patient in  january and have the actors  battling out.  on the days we have policy  -induced uncertainty, like  yesterday, you look at the  things to buy.  maybe not quantum computers.  >> what do you looked buy?  to make the first big theme is  artificial intelligence.  it is carrying itself into 2025. The last 2 years have been  about semi conductors.  this year has to be about a.i.  software and modernization.  it also to be about a.i.  power.  is not just a number of  headlines talking about data  centers and how much they  consume.  and you need a times the  electricity to run and a.i.  center, it is a real trend.  the trump administration will  support this as well.  for that would be the additional investment in data centers.  outlook to a.i.  software and a.i.  power themes. Broadly, i would  look to alternatives.  one thing we talked about in  the outlook as if you expect  this to be the year of broader  outcomes and higher volatility  in the public markets, that's  why you may want to have that  he's in your portfolio of the  private markets where you have  typically higher risk adjusted  returns and less volatility  with more insulation.  >> is is the vintage?  are you going to look back, in  the alternative world where you  are playing private markets,  the reason there is a  volatility is because you don't  get to see the volatility.  for you to see the marks on a  quarterly basis.  it's for sure, but five to 7  years from now, do you look  back and say well, this was a  great time to get in?  >> i think that is one of those  years.  2021 was clearly not that here.  if you sent in a private equity  or venture capital, you did so  at high valuations.  we don't have that anymore.  were not at the same rock- bottom evaluations that we saw  in 2022 and 2023.  if you look at private equity,  they are trained below. It is a  decent point to step in.  for investors that have an  allocation for private equity  or they can purchase a second  during the middle-market buyout , with they can benefit from,  the pickup in activity that ",

                "Founder and managing director.  an investment consulting firm.  greg, good morning, always  great to see you.  >> good morning.  >> i want to start things off  with a sound bite last night  and see if you agree or  disagree.  >> we know the fed can't raise  rates.  that would make them look like  total idiots.  after we get a report and  interest rates go higher,  plenty of people say stocks got  ahead of themselves.  there are others who know only  one thing, if rates are going  higher, then we're headed for a  burst of inflation that will  send stocks lower.  >> so, greg, kramer's thesis,  higher bond yields.  it followed that read, agree  with that.  with yields the benchmark.  will that continue to put  pressure on equities?  >> i agray with that notion.  i disagree with the notion that  it is epistotic.  when we look at the inflation  read, frank, you will know,  many of us have been concerned  about what is just happening  organically.  we saw core go from 0 basis  points in june, 10 in july, 20  in august, followed by three 30  point reads and possibly a 40  point december.  both things oppose a head wind  for equities.  the organic rise of rates  fueled by deficit spending,  fueled by less of an appetite  in china, japan, potentially  others.  also, the reinsurgence, given  some of the administration  policy objectives and what that  may force the fed to do.  >> all right, part of that  thesis is investors are  counting on rate cuts going  forward.  i want to talk to you about the  fed.  this is an interesting idea  that you have here.  the feds on pace for a moment,  explain that.  your idea here is running  contrary to what kramer just  said.  what is this moment that you  think is coming up?  >> yeah, so, it harkins back to  1979 and '81.  they declared a premature  victory against inflation, and  had to come back in 1981 and  raise rates almost to 20%, far  higher than he had to do the  first time.  so while i don't want to  necessarily be alarmist and  ring the bell on something of  that nature, i do believe the  evidence is being put in that  we probably or most of us, some  of us did not.  most of us probably declared a  premature end to inflation, and  that battle was over.  the data, likely the jobs data,  the core cpi data over the last  five months, points to a  resurgence in inflation.  that is without the  inflationary platter of policy  that the administration  proposed.  >> first and foremost, thank  you.  made a little mistake on my  end.  that's a great reference, greg.  i want to get to the point of  your thesis.  you think the fed would raise  rates?  it might have been something  you said before that, but he  said the fed would lose their  credibility if they raise  rates.  do you see that as a real  possibility going forward?  >> i do see it as plausible.  this is not about a choice.  if any of us had a choice, we  would prefer for rates to stay  lower and we would prefer for  the cutting program to  continue.  i think if it is to become a  reality, the fed simply won't  have a choice.  we start to get into mass  deportation, trade wars and  tariffs, deficits, cuts on  taxes.  i think you're going to see a  very acute inflation and the  fed won't have a choice.  you have seen two governors  come out and say that they  decent from even last month's  cut.  so, you know, i think at the  very least, we're going to see  a pause.  i'm going to refrain from  saying it's likely that we see  a raise, because by the time  that becomes evident, it become  accepted that the feds have no  choice.  >> i want to ask you about a  red hot sector on the markets  over the last couple of months.  i know you're not a tech  analyst.  big upside moves when it comes  to stocks.  yesterday, comments from jen  son won, leading the whole  basket to decline double  digits.  when we see a hype cycle, what  does that do to market  sentiment?  what does that do to the market  action in your mind?  most people would afree, we're  around ai, quantum cop pouting  was supposed to be the next big  thing.  >> right.  i don't know if we're in a  height cycle, right?  because in terms of ai, we have  seen the companies putting up  the earnings growth.  we have seen the 50% earnings  growth.  while some look at the  multiples and say they are  stretched.  if you're going to give me 30%  earnings growth over the next  three years consistently, then  that's worth multiple.  so i think jenson's comments  had a natural impact in many  thought we would see the same  type of earnings s-curve within  the next five or six years and  that was worth waiting around  for.  is that worth waiting around  for if it's 20 years away?  probably not.  better places to deploy  capital.  so",

                "Believe it. But what we're interested in is  we want to help the industry get there as fast as possible.  >>> that was nvidia ceo jensen  huang with his outlook on the  quantum computing timeline. Shares of nvidia rebounding  slightly this morning after  sliding more than 6% yesterday. By the way, what he said about  quantum computing managed to  take out a lot of those quantum  computing stocks, some of the  smaller ones like ion q, quantum computing, rigetti. Joining us is joe moore. I want to get your take on this. I've been heading a lot of  stuff. I mean, after jensen huang made  his comments the night before  last we actually saw shares a  little higher in the morning. Maybe not by a lot, but it  certainly wasn't giving back the pullback we saw later in the  day. There were a lot of the tech  stocks and other big high flyers that pulled back, though, after  we got stronger than expected  jobs numbers, just in terms of  what the bls had in terms of  jobs openings, those jolts  numbers. That had people suspect that go  maybe the fed is going to be to  be more reluctant to cut rates  anytime soon and that caused all of these big high flyers to  pullback. Do you think the pullback in  nvidia shares yesterday was more related to what jensen huang did or didn't say or more related to the overall idea of watching the federal reserve and seeing how  the economy is doing? >> i mean, i think both of those play a role. Ces is a tradeshow around  consumer and automotive.  there is important information  i came out around those  markets.  this is 85% of the revenue.  the maven expectations of  people wanted to hear more  about that.  we have some of those issues.  overall, this is still a company in a strong product cycle.  data center was not the focus,  it is investor focused.  it is a combination of the  market issues that you talked  about as well as some  expectations around the  tradeshow.  there was nothing negative to  take away.  >> one of these in terms of the  data center that the street  would really like to hear?  another revenue is expected for  the year to come in at $113  billion, ramping up of north of  $200 billion for the fiscal  year that does end in january  2027.  what people want to hear?  >> expectations are high.  we are two months into the  blackwell cycle and the new  products they started shipping.  today we would get any color on  incremental blackwell products  was probably not going to  happen.  this was not the forum for that  anyway.  from a product standpoint, we  know everything that we need to  know.  from a revenue standpoint, you  are facing a bit of a  transition.  you have blackwell demand that  is very good.  you heard the comments from  jensen huang about the level of  blackwell demand being insane.  he did not repeat those  comments.  the issue you are dealing with  is blackwell demand is strong.  it is supply constrained.  hopper, the legacy product is  the largest portion of the data  center business.  they will have a couple of  quarters here where there is  meaningful upside.  the real upside is in the back  half of the year when you get  that full-blown blackwell ramp.  people would like to hear that.  i think they did hear that in  some sense.  they are trying to avoid the  really strong statements about  blackwell, because it is not  the main driver of the quarter.  that is the combination of  blackwell at hopper.  i am optimistic about how this  plays out.  i do see the upside being  stronger in the second half of  the year.  for with the stock that has  done so well, triple last year,  how much is priced in?  where are you telling people is  a price target were people  should feel comfortable?  to this is less about the  phenomenon that the stock has  been in more on valuing a  growth company on his growth  prospects.  the stock trades at 29 times  the estimate for 2026.  that would be high if there  were any deceleration of the  business.  i don't think there is, even  through the transitional  challenges.  administer the issues, you are  beating the numbers and they  are likely to move higher.  i still think the stock is  reasonably valued with good  growth prospects here an",

                "STAGE TALKS TO RAISE AS MUCH AS  $2 BILLION AT A $60 BILLION  VALUATION. CNBC HAS LEARNED THAT THE  FUNDING ROUND IS BEING LED BY  LIGHT SPEED VENTURES. ANTHROPIC IS A CREATOR OF AN AI  CHATBOT CALLED CLAUDE. THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER  IF OpenAI ULTIMATELY IS OWNED BY MICROSOFT, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF  THAT'S A THOUGHT THAT ANTHROPIC  WOULD LAND UP IN THE HANDS OF -- WE TALKED TO LINA KHAN AND I  SORT OF THOUGHT SHE WAS HINT  THAT GO MAYBE WE WOULD HEAR  ABOUT THEIR INVESTIGATION  INQUIRY INTO ALL OF THIS STUFF  AND/OR MAYBE EVEN A SUIT.  >> THAT WAS WEIRD. THE IDEA -- YOU POINTED OUT,  WHAT IS IT, 12 DAYS NOW UNTIL -- >> AS OF YESTERDAY SHE WAS  COUNTING -- IT WAS EIGHT  BUSINESS DAYS.  >> SO REALLY? I GUESS WE WILL SEE.  >> WE WILL SEE. AND THEN THE QUESTION IS  WOULD -- YOU KNOW, DOES THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION TAKE UP THE CASE? INTERESTINGLY THE ORIGINAL  GOOGLE CASE BROUGHT BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND, YOU KNOW,  NOT HER DEPARTMENT BUT THE DOJ  CONTINUED THAT CASE. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. >> I GUESS IT GETS WEIRD IN THE  TECH WORLD BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT CLEAR GUIDELINES AS TO WHAT EACH ADMINISTRATION THINKS. IT DOESN'T FALL INTO THE OLD  KIND OF CAMPS OF WHAT YOU WOULD  THINK A REPUBLICAN VERSUS A  DEMOCRAT WOULD DO. THERE IS SOME CROSSOVER ON SOME  OF THESE THINGS AND YOU POINTED  IT OUT WITH J.D. VANCE.  >> TRUMP WAS A BIG -- ORIGINALLY PUSHED ON THE TIKTOK POSITION  AND NOW, YOU KNOW -- AND THEN  BIDEN TOOK THAT UP AND NOW IT  APPEARS -- WE WILL SEE WHAT  HAPPENS.  >> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.  >> HE HAS MADE COMMENTS  OBVIOUSLY THAT HE MAY NOT WANT  TO KILL THAT PRODUCT.  >>> A BATTLE OVER THE FATE OF  U.S. STEEL PLAYED OUT ON CNBC  YESTERDAY. THE COMPANY'S CEO DAVID BURRITT  APPEARED ON \"SQUAWK ON THE  STREET\" AND ACCUSED PRESIDENT  BIDEN OF TAINTING THE REVIEW  PROCESS FOR NIPPON STEEL'S  PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF U.S. STEEL. >> REMARKABLE DEAL AND THAT'S  WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. WE'RE TRYING TO RIGHT THE WRONGS OF THIS PRESIDENT AND MAKE SURE  THAT CFIUS IS ACTUALLY FOLLOWED. THE PROCESS HAS BEEN CORRUPT. YOU KNOW IT. I MEAN, LET'S FACE  IT. GOD KNOWS THAT THIS PROCESS HAS  BEEN TAINTED FROM THE VERY  BEGINNING AND WE NEED TO FIX IT. >> BURRITT'S POINT WAS THAT  PRESIDENT BIDEN IN BEING SO  OUTSPOKEN AGAINST THIS WAS  TELLING BASICALLY THE PEOPLE ON  CFIUS TO VOTE AGAINST IT BEFORE  THEY EVEN SAW ANY OF THIS. BURRITT WENT ON TO CALL FOR  PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP TO TAKE A  FRESH LOOK AT THE DEAL. IT WAS POINTED OUT TO HIM  REPEATEDLY THAT INCOMING  PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS NOT IN FAVOR OF THIS DEAL, EITHER, AND  CAMPAIGNED ON THAT PRETTY  HEAVILY, BUT HE SAID -- I THINK  SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES -- I  WAS LISTENING TO THE  INTERVIEW -- HE SAID SOMETHING  ALONG THE LINES OF PRESIDENT  TRUMP IS A VERY SMART MAN, I  THINK I CAN APPEAL TO HIM TO  MAKE THIS REALIZE THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. HE WOULD LIKE TO TALK WITH HIM  AND TALK THAT THROUGH. LATER IN THE DAY ON \"MAD MONEY\"  THE CEO OF CLEVELAND-CLIFFS  FIRED BACK. CLEVELAND-CLIFFS WAS A RIVAL  BIDDER FOR U.S. STEEL AND  REPEATEDLY CAST DOUBT ON THE  DEAL'S PROSPECTS TO INVESTORS. LISTEN IN. >> THE STATEMENTS COMING FROM  THE CEO OF U.S. STEEL CALLED THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  CORRUPT. AS AN AMERICAN I FEEL OFFENDED. THIS IS JUST ABSURD. >> BY THE WAY, THE U.S. STEEL  CEO BURRITT HAD ALSO CLAIMED  THAT CLEVELAND-CLIFFS WAS BEHIND SOME OF THIS, TOO, AND THAT  THEY'VE BEEN GOING AFTER THEM  FOR THE ISSUES ON THIS, TOO. SHARES OF U.S. STEEL ARE DOWN  ABOUT 15% SINCE THE DEAL WAS  FIRST ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER OF  2023. OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF QUESTIONS  STILL TO PLAY OUT IF THERE WOULD BE A REVIEW OF THE CFIUS  VERSION -- VISION ON THIS,  WHETHER INCOMING PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD CHANGE HIS MIND ON ANY OF  THESE THINGS, WHETHER THERE  WOULD BE ANOTHER BID FROM  CLEVELAND-CLIFFS, IF NOT, AND  WHETHER U.S. STEEL WOULD  CONSIDER ANY OF THES",
