<div><strong>Title:</strong> Very excited about 2025 as an IPO year, says Vista Equity's Ashley MacNeill<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> focused on software as a service. ashley mcneill to the extent our viewers know vista, it's a private equity firm i report when you do take  private. explain to us what you do as a head of equity capital markets at a firm that typically takes companies private, not public -- you know maybe they do take them public as well >> well, the fun of the equity capital markets you take things  private, re-ipo them and manage  public investor perception around software and have those conversations and understand where are they investing what  they like and don't they like. >> that helps people understand  why they should listen to you  right now. we talk about the absence of ipos 2024 was supposed to be a strong year we all have heard so often about ai-related names perhaps a bit early in their gestation. nonetheless so many others in  your portfolio why haven't we seen more ipos? what are you hearing from the  investors in terms of their, perhaps, reluctance to invest in a new company's shares >> i was very excited this time  last year because i did think  '24 was priming to be a good year but for the ipo market to open up in earnest and return to normalcy we need three things. you've heard thesethree things but we need a lack of volatility in the market. we need to see stable markets. we also need to see interest from investors we need to see a risk-on appetite finally and this is the most important and really came to fruition this year, we need to see consistency and clarity from corporations around their  business plans like how are they planning on  executing and can they hit their numbers? that formed this year which is why i think we're very excited about '25 as an an ipo year. >> there hasn't been a sem nin noll year. i talk about the private market, private credit, the ability of so many companies to stay  private for longer given the capital that's available or even for you as one private equity  firm to sell them to another what gives you the confidence, given the three things that have been in place to a certain extent this year that will be  different. >> posting has declined broadly  speaking amongst founders and  cooperations i want to balance that with the  fact that we have had a dearth of ipos. if you think 45% of u.s. vc  backed firms go public that's  like over 350 firms looking to tap the market at some point and that would take -- that  backlog f we go back to a norm l ai a -- normalized rate would take  a decade to clear. as we see investors pulling for  that and demand for the ipos coming through and strong  aftermarket performance from the ipo asset class you'll see ipos  in '25.  >> what about your portfolio companies at vista what are you seeing particularly as they start to add generative  ai to their various offerings or impacts to their business both positively and from a  competitive standpoint as well >> our portfolio has been  resilient in sort of this high cost of capital environment and  the implementation of gen ai has been game changing on a host of  levels i think from a broad perspective, software is really  poised to take advantage of this technology and sort of the new wave of capital being deployed into software. >> how would you characterize  sentiment with regard to software versus ai because as david laid out in your intro, you just raised a  $20 billion fund focused on ai,  despite kind of a software upbringing for the firm. i'm curious if that's a response to investor sentiment, and it  really, you know, there is this  kind of notion that investors  see things as a zero sum game  between ai and software or if  it's a way to kind of inform your software portfolio  companies and kind of blend the  two? >> sow software we believe will  be tbeneficiary of ai. it takes time to layer in and  see those measurable and monetizeble moments and so for software, investors need to be patient and they need to look  for breadcrumbs or proof points  of generative ai technology  making their business better there are three layers, on the growth side, on the margin or  efficiency side and the last side which i think is starting to come into play is the capex or partnership sid<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Economy's on the track the Fed wants and they can follow the dot plot, says JPMorgan's David Kelly<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> kind of black swan event out there. >> good point. yeah.  >> steve, thank you. >> sure. >>> let's talk more about what the latest numbers mean for the  fed and the markets. jpmorgan asset management chief  global strategist david kelly  joins us on set at post nine maybe you can level set on what  you think the jobs report means  for the magnitude, the pace of the fed's monetary policy. >> it's a very healthy economy we will get 2.3% on inflation  next 2.3 on inflation that's 6.4 the misery index, that number is better than it's been 89% of the time over the last 50 years. looks like the economy is on the right track, exactly the track the federal reserve would want it to be on, and therefore,  right now, they're thinking they can follow their dots and just do two more 25 basis points this year, four next year of course something will happen  to change that endogenously this economy is performing well. >> do you think today's numbers  are indicative of a risk-on  signal for the markets is this something the markets  will read as soft landing  achieved, no landing achieved? >> yes the problem is you never land  the plane. every quarter you have another quarter and every quarter we get further confirmation we're on a  soft landing track the markets,  you know, get bid up on that i am worried there are concentration issues within the  u.s. market, concentration issues within fixed income,  concentration issues in people's portfolios caused by this benign economic environment which causes people to take more risky bets.  >> concentration issues in terms much equities within other asset classes and how do you urge  investors to kind of tackle  that because we've seen over the last few years, for example, just with the mag seven that if you weren't concentrated in certain  stocks within there, you're  under performing.  >> don't just focus on the economy. focus on the shocks. the history of the 21st century  coming out of left field, lehman brothers, 9/11, the pandemic something will go wrong and  upset the economy and change people's outlook and the markets are going to come down the thing that's going to come down the most is the most  overpriced there's another way of looking at it. we have seen $50 trillion added  to household wealth in the last  five years $50 trillion there are a lot of people who a  few years ago were struggling to come up with a retirement plan and now they're there. they should be derisking and have less risk in the portfolio  than a few years ago but because of concentration their portfolios are more risky. it's a time not to just assess where the markets are but where  you are financially. for a lot of middle and upper  income households they are more  wealthy than a couple years ago. >> anything keeping the fed from pausing the way that the europeans have >> i hope they don't i want them to keep coming down. there's no economic reason for them to normalize and they can take their sweet time but rates  in the wrong place for financial markets. you need to get back to a normal neutral level of rates if the economy is fine it  doesn't need the fed messing with us. if you're on the right path you  don't need to be restrictive or  accommodative you need to get  back to normal a lot of distortions in the  market are the result of having  rates in the wrong place for ten years before the pandemic and  then rates too high in more  repeat years they should try to normalize the economy. >> they can message a 25 even if these -- >> oh, absolutely. because i think you're going to  get a 2.3 on the cpi next week as long as inflation is coming down to 2% in a weird way we can have our cake and eat it in this economy. it's capable of doing  moderate -- slow<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> will point out wamo is operating in the real world, tesla is  doing this on a movie studio lot. >>.  [ bell ringing ] >> let's get the opening bell  here in the cnbc realtime  exchange the big board, it is the american cancer society marking  breast cancer awareness month at the nasdaq celebrating an ipo it is bing x a courier services provider in china. >> i wonder if tepper is buying  that opening, tepper being the legendary buy everything guy he has been so right.  >> he has been dead right when it comes to china and that morning, it was a seminole discussion with him, the "squawk box" crew had with all that  stimulus that china has been putting in i want to come back to what you  were just talk being in tesla. >> sure. >> what is the rise of the robo  taxi if it finally is here or  very near mean for uber? >> well, it depends. >> ultimately? i mean, when you look out and  you do a five-year discounted  cash flow, whatever you want to  call it on uber, and you think about tesla's universe and if  they're really successful in creating an opportunity for  people to get a tesla taxi whenever they want, is uber also going to be a beneficiary or what is the role for them -- they don't own the cars. >> no, but four weeks ago they did do the deal with wamo and  the big -- >> yeah. >> the big thing is austin now and atlanta. those are the ones -- atlanta is really out of the range. atlanta, by the way, can we just say chuck robbins, congratulations. falcons, big but i just think that these are  the two test cities because they are out of the cloistered cocoon and wamo -- and we have to get darrell on<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Cramer's Mad Dash: Rivian<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> we've got a little less than three minutes before we get a  ienl opening bell for the week here of course, get started with  trading here on this friday. let's talk a little rivian, jim, because the company stock is going to be down after they  pulled in production numbers a bit, citing a shortage of a  shared component on the r-1 and  rcd platforms. >> the reason i thought that was interesting, they were going to  do 50,000, maybe 52,000, looks like they're going to do 47,000. it doesn't sound like it's a demand problem, sounds like it's a part problem the reason i point that out is a demand problem at ford is bad, man problem -- i'm talking about ev not hybrid. david, evs everywhere are under  this turmoil europe just put through -- you've got these tariffs.  >> tariff on the chinese evs.  >> i want to believe that rivian is right, i believe they're  terrific, they got the time with amazon i want be to believe they're right that it's a part and not a demand this sector away from tesla is shear hell right now.  >> they reaffirm their annual  delivery outlook of low  single-digit growth as compared  to last year, jim. again, a range of 50,000 to  52,000 vehicles, but to your point they revised the annual  production guidance to between 47,000 and 49,000 vehicles this problem i just mentioned  has they said become more acute  in recent weeks and continues. >> it just -- i need mor information because nobody else  has a spot problem one of the things i thought was  great -- one thing that's gone is the whole supply problem with the semis, maybe this is another part these guys are not in a position to miss. they are just not. the stock has been one way ever  since they got the number from vw doesn't seem like a good shift in the ev game.  >> next week we're going to be talking about the robo taxi. >> it's so huge. >> and how important that will be for tesla and their future. >> the robo taxi i think is so significant because it's beginning to get a lot of  traction in a lot of different cities when that happens i think people will realize it's much cheaper than uber. so if you are willing to take  the plunge, you can save 30% on  uber, which is pretty -- if you  get a wamo i know when we looked at our<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> An IPO for OpenAI is inevitable, says Axios' Dan Primack<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> box. a huge week for openai company closing $6.6 billion round. securing a $4 billion revolving  credit line. joining us for what this could mean for the next company to go  this round, and investors axios  business eder, a huge valuation. the question is how this all resolves itself? when an ipo happens. does an ipo happen conversation you've written  about it using some of this  money to actually buy out  earlier employees. where do you think this all  goes >> i do think an ipo is  inevitable it's not something sam altman  and company want to do tomorrow. they obviously value their trade secret in all sorts of ways  don't like talking what they're  doing before they do it. ultimately talking, andrew, you  know, talking about $157 billion valuation no one's buying this thing. handful of companies that could  afford to would never get it through antitrust. ultimately the out for investors is an ipo. makes sense for openai they're going to need lots nor money and public markets are the best place to find that. >> the next question how much more money is this  company going to need? talking to walter isaacson earlier. scaling. bigger you get closer to bigger  and bigger profit margins. in the context of a.i. the power consumed and number of chips that need to be bought, and the  processing that's taking place it does not necessarily seem that the more you add the bigger the profits get? >> yeah. there's no evidence that where we get there, it's a little like building a giant skyscraper. an enormous amount of work to  get done before you can really generate revenues that can overcome that. again, a huge commute power for  the research more people who use it including more commute power third piece,  wrote about it yesterday, my colleague at axios incredible talent push right now. to get researchers you need. compete with elon musk, compete  with anthropic, et cetera. that costs an insane amount of money. much more than any other start-up dealt with. >> how do you look at what's happened at openai a number if not many, many of  the early founders that carpeted at the company at the outset no longer there. it does look like greg brockman  will come back to the company  later this year. so you're going to have him as well as sam there. they brought in a lot of new talent do you think that shifts the balance in terms how this race plays out? >> maybe a little bit. interesting. from speaking to investors in  this round, one of the things i  asked, venture capitalists usually talk about investing in  people the people who are at openai when this round began compared to where it closed you say, seriousist ist serious  shifts the answer i got, part of the  company shifting from nonprofit  to for-profit model, part of this deal. that they're really moving from  a research lab into a  product-focused company and thus needs different people the fact research lab, people  aren't there anymore doesn't seem to concern investors pap  notable new name is sarah friar. ceo of nextdoor previously ran square/block with dorsey think about will it go public? the cfo who would know how to  take it public.  >> what do you think the timeline is for that >> god knows i think realistically probably within a couple of years within this deal there was a promise that openai played to  investors that it would complete that transition into a for-profit structure within two  years. don't do it within two years investors could ask for their  man back would openai have the cash to  give it to them? an open question openai should try to do this in  a couple years no particularly good reason not  to every company that's ever said we don<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Walter Isaacson on the AI tech race, xAI vs. OpenAI and Elon Musk's mission<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> this week openai clipsing xai in the race to artificial intelligence raising billions  passing the $6 billion raised by elon musk back in may. joining us to discuss what is  turning out to be quite the tech a.i. race and author of elon musk, also advisor and partner and professor and importantly  cnbc contributor nice to see you. >> and friend of andrew. >> friend of "squawk"'s. walter what do you make of the race what do you think about openai you may think everybody is close to each other and xai by my eyes actually has caught up or gotten very close very, very quickly. >> yes xai caught up very much and i  saw musk and sam altman together about a week ago there's, of course, a little bit of, a large built of tension that goes back four, five years  when they both started openai  and now sam has taken openai making it no longer open and no  longer not for-profit. and telling people invest in us  we don't want you to invest in others interesting the script getting flipped a bit next week, october 10th when elon introduces robotaxi  and things that operate in the real world when musk bought twitter he got  this huge data feed. when he has tesla, he has a  billion frames from cars every day. that's the -- the big thing you  need is the data set to train on and the big next leap is real-world a.i cars that drive themselves,  robots that walk.  >> one of the questions becomes  how xai will be integrated, or not, into the development  efforts of these other products. >> tell you one thing about elon musk he tries to integrate  everything he's not going to set up walls and silos even though some, you  know, tesla's publicly traded. xai -- >> what i was going to ask investor class, xai. we know. investors class in tesla another investor class in  spacex.  >> when he took over twitter he  brought engineers from tesla and other companies to help build  the a.i. -- he blurs those lines. plus, he even has neurolength, the company implanting chips in  the brain. if you're wondering. is he going to bring all of  these things together? my guess is, my guess, my answer is, yes. >> the ability for him to  advance as quickly as he has literally there was no true a.i. effort in terms of inside xai  that didn't exist a year ago.  >> right i remember, coming to austin,  texas, sitting in the back of, by a swimming pool in a house  somebody rented. telling me i'm going to start  from scratch an a.i. company because i don't trust sam  altman.  >> how much, though, does, is  this a business that is just a function of processing power if you have enough money to buy  enough chips and you can get nvidia to give them to you, or to sell them to you, that you  can be, not just a player in this game but one of the top tier players how much is it that versus the alchemy, the sort of software  talent, the engineering talent,  to be able to write algorithms and how is it possible in a  year, or less, this group has  managed to do it while google, which was clearly at the, you  know, they were the art of all of this in the beginning i actually think inside google the same talents but struggled to productize it or what's happened, but it looks very  different? >> google, google deep mind and do gemini. my opinion greatest mind at the  moment looking at a.i. but you're right at the moment gemini is not  racing ahead of anthropic or xai or openai. i think that part of it is musk  was very smart and good at getting nvidia chips getting cpus one of the factors creating his own chip taking a longer time, dojo chip, doing  visual data, and once again you  saw a blurring of the lines. getting some nvidia chips for i  think tesla and then he was  moving it to xai.  >> his plan not to be open either, by the way.  >> no, no. >> right so this whole idea of he can be  frustrated or upset but thinks openai is not open but building  his own closed system, too.  >> total consistency >> is it about who controls it and do you have more faith in -- >> i mean from a very elevated perspective. having watched musk very up  close for a couple of years, i'm going to say something you might think is naive but i really  believe it, which is he has  certain missions he's had his  whole life read isaac, read the robot series thought the robots might turn on us i have to come in and save us  from hostile a.i i have to make this -- >> do you think he will? i believe you 100% on his  mission. i believe that's who he is.  >> and started an a.i. company buying twitter >> do you believe -- do you  think a.i. is safer in his hands than's in sam altman's hands no i don't know i wouldn't make that judgment. sorry not to give ayou a snap answer here. >> a complex question? >> here's a real question what he believes versus others. it's that the more a.i.s you have, does that make it safer? 12 companies, 20 companies doing it, competing a.i.s, does that make it safer? or is it better to be  concentrated in the hands of a few? like google -- >> like lina khan. >> and musk believes more the  merrier because they're check  each other.  >> a very important point. >> how many do you think there will all minutely be some argue a lot of smaller  language models but the  frontier, language, language models, cost a fortune to run. at some point, don't you think that they will either get  merged, people say, look take all the processing power  put it towards this or -- three  in the end or do you think this is a five or six or seven-player race? >> i think three or four and i think you're right certain natural factors. i mean, you need enormous  amounts of electricity three mile island plant agai<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Belfor Holdings CEO on Hurricane Helene aftermath: The damage is so extensive and devastating<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> >>> it's been a week since hurricane helene slammed into  the southwestern united states leaving a path of destruction. over 200 dead with hundreds for  still unaccounted for  potentially. more than a million without  power and the cost could total more than $34 billion. according to moody and joining us ceo of belfor holdings specializing in property restoration and recovery i think the largest property restoration and recovery >> largest in the world. >> in the world. sheldon, you have been down in florida until this time working. your voice strained as a result  of this is tell us what you've seen and what you all are working on. >> well, this storm reminds meep a little bit of katrina in 2005  with the depth of destruction, and then i couple it with  hurricane hugo back in 1989 with the whiff and geographic coverage look at the big bend area  between tampa and tallahassee  and go up through georgia, a little west to alabama, south  carolina, north carolina we've all heard about asheville  and then into tennessee you're talking about 600-plus miles of  coverage the damage, the devastation. and i think that when you look at the downed power lines, the lack of cell service, the  bridges, the infrastructure  that's wiped out, people still not able to return home, and,  again, please, i say, heed advice of your heroic first  responders remember downed power lines and  water don't mix. you cannot take it upon yourself to go back to see your house, to see your business. you have to get clearance to go  into these zones.  >> kind of shocking we are a week out and there are still so  many people unaccounted for. can you describe what you're seeing with this rescue efforts? >> the -- unfortunately our  hearts go out to the families  who have lost loved ones over 200 now excuse me. still 100 people unaccounted for. these first responders are using every minute they have to look,  search and rescue. it's still a rescue operation, and the devastation is so  widespread with lack of  communication, it's making it  very, very difficult some of our high-water terrain vehicles are being utilized to get responders in and our areas  and we're working alongside of them even belfor employees. but the damage we've seen is so  extensive and devastating. complete villages are wiped out. complete infrastructure needs to be rebuilt.  and belfor comes in with utility workers and all people restoring communications an everything,  because we have to restore these communities. how do you restore a community infrastructure and then  buildings that serve the community. hospitals. we are all over hospitals. k-12 belfor people in these facilities industrial and commercial. people's livelihoods dependent on the factories getting up and  running again and, again,  keeping safety first, because we have to make sure everybody's  safe, and we've got to prevent from mold and mildew growing so all of the equipment we bring in are mobile command centers  with satellite communications, being utilized our logistical operations are  enormous, because we have, in  asheville, we have over 800  people there now in the big bend area we have over 900 people there now. we have 65 people arriving every day. to add to the force. logistically we got to provide water, food for all of our people so they can continue to work,  and get these facilities back up and running as fast as possible. so communities can start to  return to normal.  >> have you run into problems  with fema not having money you see that all over the story  that they're broke fema is that, has that been an issue  in terms of what you're trying to do? do you know is that factual? >> so i don't know firsthand what money they have or don't  have, but i've always seen over  my mast 40 years is in a fema's  never funded for an event that they're talking about $34  billion additional dollars.  >> until after --  >> they get funded in short  order. >> okay. >> the stuff that happening on the ground it's horrific. we've heard people saying  there's not help there there's not help coming. can you explain what's happening? >> i think the reports of, there's no help available, is  also due to the fact that  there's a lack of communication. people don't know what others  are doing. what i can tell you firsthand, what i've seen i've seen the heroic efforts of  our everyday citizens. neighbor helping neighbor. people reaching out to do one  small act of kindness for  somebody one hug of hope. that is the energy that's needed in these situations. and i think that that is unfolding slowly i think when communication gets  restored, and power slowly comes back, because they're talking  about it could be another couple weeks. you're going to see people's hope rise. >> but, sheldon, you think the rescue workers, the front line,  are doing the best they can  under very difficult circumstances? >> our heroic first responders are doing everything they can. they are stopping at nothing like i said earlier, they're utilizing some of our equipment. some of our vehicles to get to areas they can't get to on their own. they're working shifts and i've  heard peop<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Israel has the ability to cripple, but not eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities: Meghan O’Sullivan<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> fears that israel could strike iran's oil industry in retaliation for tehran's missile attack earlier this week for the latest on the rising tensions there, we want to bring in megan o'sullivan, director of the bellfor center she's a former deputy national security adviser in the george w. bush administration and currently serves on secretary of state blinken's foreign policy advisory board thank you, megan, for joining us this morning we're trying to make sense of  what's happening right now with  the potential strikes, how do  you read this? what do you think is most  likely >> thanks, becky happy to be with you this  morning. i think what we're seeing is still a very large uncertain landscape where israel is  weighing the whole span of options. we have seen already that  president biden has publicly said that the u.s. would not support strikes against iran's nuclear facilities but the reality is, if you're  israel, you're looking at this landscape and you're thinking  about when will be a better time to take out and fundamentally  change the regional balance. right now, you have american forces and carriers in the region you also have israel's nemesis hezbollah, hamas, other iranian  proxies on the back foot and you have the price of oil  pretty low in the markets, weak  relative to what they could be and it may be that israel  assesses that there won't be a better time in the future, particularly if this confrontation leads iran to up its nuclear capabilities >> meaning, an attack on oil facilities or meaning an attack  on their nuclear positions >> i'm talking about why the question keeps arising will israel attack iran's  nuclear facilities i think they're weighing that  against, one, they're  capabilities but we have all been taught a  lesson in the last ten days or more that it is a mistake to underestimate iran's nuclear capabilities and perhaps it wouldn't be a military attack of some kind i know, of course, they're weighing other options, which  include energy infrastructure, as we have seen highlighted by president biden's off the cuff comments recently. and, of course, military targets are very much on the table >> very quickly, do you consider attacks on the oil infrastructure are a given >> no, not a given per se. we think about the attacks on  oil infrastructure, there are  two kinds that the israelis  might consider there are many kinds, but two  large. they could attack some infrastructure that is largely geared toward domestic consumption. iran is pumping maybe 3.3  million barrels of oil a day and consumie ing half that inside o  iran it will almost certainly, if it  comes, lead to more attacks  on -- or attacks on  infrastructure, around the region, potentially, which is  part of the reason why there is  nervousness in the oil markets right now. though, still less than we would expect if the oil markets were in a stronger, tighter position  than they are. >> the oil that they pump, that  they use internally, most of that is going to china do we care if china is unhappy,  if something happens to that oil supply >> i mean we do care about the global economy and, of course, the oil market is a global market it is not as if that oil, that potentially 1.8 million barrels  a day of oil that is flowing from iran to china, if that oil  is cut off, or terminated for  any reason, it is not just the chinese who will be affected by  the higher price it is, of course, the whole  global economy so, what could be potentially  useful here is that china could  be a constructive player in  this, in terms of trying to tamp down escalation and the  potential regional war but it just shows you that you have a lot of actors that are  going to be affected think about the russians,  increasing the price of oil is going to help the russians end their war against the  ukrainians this is already really moving  into having global implications, even before we have seen a retaliatory strike by the  israelis.  >> meghan, how likely do you think it is if israel went after their nuclear positions that they would be effective in setting back their -- iran's nuclear ambitions? >> yeah, i think this is the big question and frankly i think most military analysts believe that the israelis do not have the capability to go after -- to be  successfully in terms of eliminating iran's nuclear programs there are a variety of different places in which they could cripple the -- some elements of  the nuclear facilities the real question, i think, to focus on is even if the strikes  are not against the nuclear  facilities, what are the calculations of iran going to  be iran clearly has to have the message that its conventional  capabilities are just not up to  snuff against israel and that israel has the ability  to change the regional calculation, based on the  configuration of power right now. one way that iran can change that is by expediting or going beyond its current virtual threshold state or status as a nuclear power. and i think that we need to be seriously concerned about  whether these events, however  they play out, whatever the  configuration and the nature of  the israeli military action, whether <br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> potential effect on the  marketplace and investors  psyches, because we've seen the  fed now flip their lens to the labor market here's two seconds away. and -- as we come, hitting the wires on the september jobs  report --  the over wins. 254,000. significantly better than  150,000 expected and upward  revision to last month from  142,000. to 159,000 which means the two-month  revision now is a little over  70,000 if we look at the unemployment rate, it is at 4.1 4.1. it moved lower i can hear yields moving higher  as we speak, and 4.1, of course, equals where we were in june you have to go to may to get a lower number at 4% average hourly earnings month  over month bet than expected up  0.4% equalling where we have been in  may. you have to go back to the beginning of the year, january,  when we can up half of 1%. now, if you look at average  hourly earnings on a year over year basis, this number also much better than expected. 4% 4% that equals where we were in may. you have to go to march to find  a higher number at 4.1%. workweek 34.2 which makes it actually 0.1 less than expected and 0.1 less in  the rearview mirror. to find a lower workweek you have to go back a long way you have to go all the way back  to 34.3, which is going to bring you -- in february of this year. finally, the utilization the labor force participation  rate 62.7 it's been holding there. not a bad number 62.7's actually the best number  of the year that we've seen on multiple occasions you have to go to november of  last year to find a higher number at 62.8 and finally, the under employment rate. actual employment rate 4.1 called u3. u6 underemployment rate, moving  higher at 7.9 our last look, which was  the highest since october of '21. it came down 0.2 to 7.7 which  equated to lowest level since  june of this year. yields shot up now at now 394, 395 in ten year. and these are big, smart reversals. today now marks the third  consecutive session that treasury yields have climbed over the previous high yield or  look at it in terms of low prices, which means building momentum to higher yields and  that's important, considering we settled the ten year last week get this at 375 so we've seen some significant moves, and on the short end, we  settle a two year last week at 356. so it's up 30 basis points fro<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> The U.S. is enjoying a 'Goldilocks' moment, says BofA's Savita Subramanian<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> wisdom tree. welcome to the future of investing. >>> september employment report  will be coming our way at 8:30 a.m. eastern time. joining us now, savita subramanian, head of u.s. equity and quantity strategy at b of a  securities we usually have you here to talk overall about equities but is there a jobs number today. is it -- there are some  different i guess angles to  cover with the jobs report what it does for the fed, what that means to the stock market,  what it does for the election, are all these things things  you're considering for what you  tell your clients to do? >> well, today's report not so much i feel like we're one week doesn't make a trend, one month  doesn't make a trend but i think when you kind of look at the background right now, everything that we're hearing about is relatively  inflationary wouldn't you think like, i mean, when i look at what's going on with the fed,  the fed is cutting interest  rates or has embarked on an  interest rate cutting cycle. china is trying to stimulate their economy. the fed is actually cutting as profits are accelerating, which  almost never happens.  >> all time highs in the market. >> all time high >> the porstrike was settled,  that was not --  >> the port strike was settled,  it was settled for higher wages, 62% over the next ten years or something along those lines. we have this big kind of wage  increase in the works, and i feel like this is an environment where maybe inflation isn't  spiking back to 9%, but there is an argument we see a little  pickup in inflation over the next 12 to 24. >> i mean, 4 would be  devastating if that happened on  top of the 20. >> you know what's so  interesting, think about where we are now and i feel like it is anchoring. because, you know, back in 2017, if we thought that interest  rates were going to be 5% and  inflation was going to be 3-ish, we would have thought the market would be a heck of a lot lower than it is today so, i think what we're seeing is just corporates adapting to, you know, a different rate, a  different inflation environment. i said this, and some people think i'm crazy, but i think real rates of 1.5 to 2% would be okay for the economy we have seen this before, we have seen it in the '80s and the '90s folks think that rates are unsustainably high right now and they're going to choke off the economy. when you think about where rates are today, and nominal rates and real rates, they're lowish levels relative to --  >> if we did have a 4% print over the next year for inflation, you think that would  be okay? >> i think it would be okay for  certain parts of the market. >> you say corporations. for people buying eggs or  whatever it is they're buying, i don't think that's going to feel good at all. >> it is not going to feel good  for the consumer the lower income consumer and  lower to midincome consumers are also chasing prices. but when you look at corporate profits, what is shocking to me  is that we went through a period of, you know, 9% cpi and corporate profits barely compressed it was like a couple of basis  points >> if they're gouging, they  should have -- >> i don't think they were gouging, though. i think it was just an environment where they were  figuring out ways to cut costs.  >> they raised prices but not  enough to cover their costs. >> well, i think that it was an  environment where they did a bunch of everything as corporates do to rejigger their  business model margins compressed a tiny bit  and for certain sectors that were more labor intensive. but i think what was shocking is how little they compressed during that environment. so i guess what i'm saying is i  think we're in an environment  where corporates are adapting to this new normal of higher for  longer rates and inflation,  versus what we were in the 2010s. >> back to the 4%, not saying it would be that. who knows, pick a number higher  than 2 does the fed go another 120  basis points, 150 basis points down >> i think the fed has -- i'm  not a fed expert and i leave that up to our economists. but they're signaling they're  buying themselves latitude to  change their mantra. this whole time they have been data dependent, driven by the  data at the beginning of the year, we thought they were going to be a  lot more cuts than what we're  actually seeing, the market has  survived again, i think the fed is  important, but not necessarily the ultimate arbiter i think what is important, if  you step back and look at what's going on right now, in corporate america, we have got reshoring,  we have got this manufacturing pickup in certain parts of the u.s. economy that haven't been busy for a really long time. we have got nominal gdp growth,  surprising to the upside i hate to say this word, because i know that equity strategies  are always accused of being  polly annaish and i've been  bearish before, but i feel like  this is goldilocks this might be goldilocks we got the u.s. is actually in a pretty good position >> you feel scared saying that >> i do. i feel like i'm going to struck  down by lightning. but i think that there is an argument to be made that cyclicals are going to do okay,  that consumers are going to  continue to spend, maybe not as  much as they did when inflation  was zero, and, you know, the world goes on. >> getting resolved so quickly,  again, we don't know what  happens come january, getting  that resolved quickly before it  causes massive problems, you still have the middle east.  >> right, you have --  >> and china, that is doing all  kinds of stimulus. >> china is stimulating. the two biggest economies in the world are in stimulus mode i think that's positive. and potentially inflationary is the market multiple justified? in parts, it is too high but think about it, we have got  areas of the economy and manufacturing that have been underinvested in for a decade or more and now they're coming back  online and granted there is supply  chain issues and strikes and,  you know, the typical friction,  but i think that what we're  seeing right now is sort of a  shift from just spending on tech and asset light business models, all the time, to a more normal capex cycle, a more normal economy, a little bit higher rates, a little bit higher inflation, goldilocks, i'll say  it again.  >> higher inflation won't be goldilocks for most people it has got -- and the fed is set in stone at 2, they can't back off it they're getting criticized about, you know, shifting to labor when the job is not done with inflation if there is any spike back up  there, they're going to be -- i  just think they're very paranoid about that.  >> i think the fed might pause who knows. they could even hike again.  >> we'll know another pause that we'll be waiting for we'll finish with the last pause. that was going up. >> that was, yes, i know it is interesting. i think the fed is -- obviously  critically important, but i  think what is al<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Banerji: Buckle up for today's jobs report.<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> this one will factor in, but you need more than one surprise to move them off the base case of 25 basis points. >> speaking of surprises,  gunjan, the markets seem to be holding rather steady, kind of near the all-time levels is the market right now  expecting volatility given this  particular jobs report if so, just how volatile could it be? >> the message from the market is really buckle up for today's  jobs report. throughout the week when i had been talking to traders, they  say they are watching for this morning's release for clues on the labor market and economy is  headed we have seen mixed data. i think this is evis evident in  options market where they are  moving 1% for the s&p 500 and  1.9% for the russell 2000 which, of course, tends to be more  sensitive to the economic data releases and the economy ups and downs. i think the expect tations are high >> let's talk about the small  caps trade which is part of the  broadening out of the thesis of  the market why the volatility and just how  much are people expecting? you mentioned the moves for the  small caps 1% up or down. 1% for the s&p is that better or worse than we've seen in recent history >> it is really interesting. for the s&p 500, the 1% move is  above the moves we've seen for the broad stock market index and jobs market releases over the  past year. when you take a look at the  russell, it's interesting  because you hear about the broadening out and soft landing  trade that's swept markets the russell is down since the  federal reserve cut rates a few  weeks ago. it's down around 2% and the s&p  500 has risen. that is showing you there is fear creeping into the mar<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Ferguson: This number is one of several that will be important.<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> vice chairman and gunjan banerji. they are both cnbc contributors. ro roger, i'll start with you just how particular is this jobs number given the jumbo sized number we have gotten to kickoff a cycle of rate cuts >> i think this number is going  to be one of several that will be important the fed has said it is data  dependent, but not data point  depe dependent. this will factor into the  decision in november markets will focus on it,  obviously. it may lead to volatility. i would say overall for the fed, this is one number to look at  with others coming along they will also be in  a wait-and-see mode. >> roger, can you take us behind the doors? what does this conversation  sound like fromme fed chair jay powell to the board with the labor dynamic and inflation  given everything we've seen with the ports? >> look, i think you heard chair powell talk a little while ago he clearly was indicating to me, at least, 25 basis points as a cut, is the base case. i think he said clearly we're  not in a rush and we heard it  that from a few others having said that, we know they are willing to move higher and the decision is not yet made i think behind doors, basically, it's wait and see and this will  validate the market is the labor market coming into balance i think they know there are many other data points to come as well i think watching closely, but  not in the position to even  start to pencil numbers other  than t<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Firestone: A surprising jobs report could scare the market.<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> rates. joining me now is kari firestone of aureus management good morning, kari let's start off with the overall macro market narrative is this one you feel can be  really affected by the jobs  report today no matter what it says >> hi, dom great to see you, too. yes, of course, if the jobs  report is very different from  what was expected. if we have a low number or even  a negative number, it's hard to  believe. yes, you could have the market be scared that who knows what's  going on in the economy. the economy right now is leading the market it's good news and good movement in the market. we want the numbers to be  recently good. gdp to go up and this landing to not start crashing if the number is way too high, then we will worry whether the fed will keep lowering interest  rates. that's unlikely. the back drop is inflation is  coming down and the economy is recently strong. we are not in a recession. we know that interest rates are  on the decline so, that's a nice set up for this fourth quarter which is supposed to be a strong one for  earnings.  >> sure. seasonally strong for the  markets and stronger for ear earnings the economic back drop is okay all of those things should be  bullish. my question, kari, is the  broadening out trade continue? should we be focused on value  parts of the market which has of late, anyway, out performing >> exactly that's why my word of the day is dimension. we think that the dimension of the market really has been shifting outward the breadth is shifting. we have seen it over the last  quarter. the s&p has seen 490 names below the top ten which sell for under 19 times next year's earnings  have made a move they were 18 times now they're 19, but they're  still way below 26 times for the top ten which represent 34% of the weight of the market that's come down as we have seen industrials and healthcare and utilities. a real broadening. there is value in that part of the market they have to continue to show  earnings growth, but it's 490  names versus ten that is critical for the market  to continue to go higher.  >> if that is the case, and you  need that broadening out to  continue, what key parts of the  market are they value or growth -- what key parts are you seeing what benefits the stock market the most in the tailwind environment? >> dom, as you know, we're more  growth investors and if the  economy is growing, then we  believe that growth is really  going to continue to carry this  trade forward. it is not hyper growth it can be industrials. we own a company in the  industrial they do rental equipment they will help in hurricane  helene ford is breaking itself up similar to general electric. all sorts of capital products  and technology products. it can be financials names like health equity that's a health saving company american express we like on the healthcare side, we like  abbott because the test  equipment and devices are really showing dprgrowth and some of te problems they had in the last  couple years we feel will be minimized this year. if you are a stock picker, you look for ideas in different  sectors. it can<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Beijing is trying to put a 'floor' on the economy with its stimulus measures: China Beige Book CEO<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> sending stocks soaring in hong kong for the latest on the beige  book, leland miller. leland, welcome. why don't you tell us the  forecast >> we have to have a short-term  outlook in the macro economy the stimulus package has put us  in two directions. on the stock market, of course,  things are going well. they will probably go well for a while longer it's a short-term put by the government they are encouraging everyone t get in and redeem investor spirits and a cheery couple  months for the stocks. on the macro environment, it is  a different period very little of this is coming  into effect. they are trying to put a floor on the economy and stabilize it. they are not reaching for a  higher ceiling whether it is property or  consumption or credit, they're trying to do measures across the board that just improve things just enough so they can shift  their focus on things they care  about a lot more >> it's interesting. we were speaking with an oil analyst yesterday who made that  same point we were asking why, since then we have seen prices come up. we heard from president biden  yesterday addressing the middle  east why we hadn't seen oil prices  rise just on what china had done and he said the same thing these are stimulus measures  really targeting the stock market, not necessarily the  broader economy there. >> that's true, but if you also  look at what they're talking about doing, they're talking points about consumption they said, okay, we'll issue a couple trillion yuan of bonds. we'll use some of that for consumption, whether it is handouts or pulling growth forward through trade-in offers. on the other hand, we'll feed  the economy some things and  we're going to backstop  property the idea that's going to send  commodities to the moon that's going to juice the economy in  the traditional ways china sees  stimulus reacting inside it's  economy. very different type of thing they're talking about now. very few details so far. most of this is gain is about  making sure the doom confidence  op where consumers and investors and households seeking sentiment feeding off itself i think they're trying to stop that it's not really a commodities  play at this point.  >> leland, how much of that is boosting investors within china  and how much of that is boosting foreign investor confidence? i think that's the thing that's  been shaken so much. the tensions between beijing and washington and commentary out of beijing and concerns from u.s. businesses that maybe they don't have a safe way of doing business there do any of these measures make  you feel this is a safer place for american investors or  businesses these days? >> not at all. they don't have anything to do with rule of law or china  cracking down on western companies. what this is is an opportunistic play in the stock market the government will backstop you jump in as long as you can if you are in china and trying to actually determine whether  you're future looks better now than a month ago and you are a household, you are trying to figure out how this advantage is in the long term is this a onewone-offhandout ors this long term been efficiently  to me? if you are a corporate, we have  seen bottom barrel will this spur beyond a month or two or will it simply look at  lower rates and say no, thank  you. the question is, is this a structural pivot in the minds of people in china to change  behavior going forward i think we haven't seen enough from the stimulus package to convince this is going to  happen.  >> what would change your mind on that front? what would make you think this is more long lasting on the  grouped there? >> i think you have to be a lot  more demand side stimulus, but not one off. it has to be construction  economy so it is not disincentivizing in order to  advantage -- you don't want to reduce the savings rate to take  the credit and plow into manufacturers for instance you want to see an economy that  works for you if you are a chinese family what is happening as part of the financial system is suppression  of households to boost the state. they need to reverse that to see the sentiment shift. >> what's your expectation for growth there for the rest of the year and next year >> look, they've done enough so  they will claim to be near the 5% gdp growth target a lot of what's happening right  now as it has been suggested on  the consumption side is pulling  in growth. if you are trading in growth,  you will not need them in the  medium term negative.stabilize creating all these swap  facilities for stocks and they will be plowing all the money  into things they don't care  about like asset markets, how  long will this last? how much will the boost be once you get to the point in the stock market, what happens then? does everyone sell into this that's every stock market rally  in the last 15 years it's a real big question beyond  the next several months what's going to happen. growth will go up a little bit,  but we may be back to the  drawing board if they don't do a lot more.  >> leland, do you ever go to china or is this based on what you're reading what sources are you looking at? >> we have an active survey that tracks china for thousands of  firms every month. i do go to china it's a different environment there now than it was five or  ten years ago. i think the core here is we're trying to get responses from around the country the problem for people jumping into china is they go to beijing and shanghai and one other choice city and they bring back  their impressions. what china beige book is trying  to do is do away with that survey all of the country and sectors and regions rather than  just an impression of a trip or  two or three.  >> what is different versus five or ten years ago i haven't been there myself. >> that's why the sentiment. the idea for a while is china  was changing and china was growing. there was still opportunity. i think what happened offever t  last four or five years is the belief the government is cracking down and it's not focused on supporting growth or  not supporting households and  consumers. you look at borrowing and you  look at investing and hiring and metrics underneath the hood are  looking really bad and particularly borrowing for years now. the idea is how can you kick china sentiment back up a coup<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Pettit: The market is fairly valued; we need to dig deeper for stock picks.<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> and citigroup is laying out the  stocks that are in the best  position to out perform in the next few months. for the top picks, let's bring in drew pettit drew, let's go through the names because some have to really  stand out for you to call them the top picks. take us through what they are  and what makes them such appealing picks going into the first quarter of next year >> dom, thanks for having me look, let's start with the overall market view. we think the index is pretty fairly valued at this point. look, i think the trailing earnings just over 23 times and  an index that just exceeded our  target means we need to dig  through the surface to find the  stock picks. the three i look at this morning are meta and lng and on the  value side is united air >> okay. let's go through each of those first, let's talk about the  mystery chart. meta platforms i believe it made mark zuckerberg the second richest  person in the world behind elon  musk at this point let's go through the meta  thesis it's already up 65% so far this  year why is it up for more gains in the final three months of the  year >> so, just like its industry  group and sector, while the stock has run and expectations are high, they are attainable  when you look at estimates one,  two and three years out. so, this, honestly, on top of  potential any economic weakness, we think the secular trends  really hold here that should help drive this  stock forward. from our analyst perspective,  engagement is up on the  platform some of the early a.i. investment is really helping with return on advertising spend and then on top of that, you are actually seeing continual  operational improvement even though we're in an investment  year i think that's really key  because going forward we want to see platforms like this have operating leverage >> that's the meta story let's go through the lng it is well off the highs from  last few years it has seen a nice run as of late why lng? >> energy in general is well off its highs. this was a contrarian overweight for us heading into q4 we really think there was  nothing priced in for energy stocks in general. the markets really don't expect  much out of this for a lot of the sector, you are starting to see margin improvement as well. lng is a dominant natural gas  exporter we think it can double its u.s.  footprint and our analysts think 2024 ebitda dguide and estimate  are not too low. it might not be a high quality name versus some of the growth stocks people talk about all the time, but a quality improver again, that's important on the cyclical side of the market. >> drew, we have a few moments left i want to get through the last quickly. united airlines. why? >> so, we just upgraded  transports i think this is an interesting thesis here. a lot of companies have  fundamentals set to stabilize or not inflect higher when you look at ual, it is  still way down this is a value stock. trades at single digit pes the unit revenue is set to m<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> crude, price of crude up 10% this week alone. escalating violence in the middle east and fears of potential israeli strike on  iran's oil production keeping  the markets now on edge. >>> u.s. port workers are  returning to their jobs today  after reaching a temporary labor deal to end the strike frank holland joins us from  bayone, new jersey what does it look like there today? >> reporter: good morning to you, becky sun is coming up you see behind me the cranes aren't moving, but they're expected to get moving later on  today, things are expected to  get back to normal so from now to january 15th, ports from maine to texas  including the port of new york and new jersey, that's right here behind me, going to be back up and running as the first  eastern gulfport strike in just  about 50 years has come to an  end on a tentative agreement,  until january 15th the union and port operators,  they have agreed on wages with a 61.5% increase over a six-year contract they're going to continue to negotiate other issues including maybe most importantly the use of automation and semiautomation at ports you see me talking to union  president harold daggett, that's when he first told us of the demand of 61.5%. we're hearing from president biden, he issued a statement on  this tentative deal, he said in  part, i want to thank the union  workers, the carriers and port operators for acting patriotically to reopen our  ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for hurricane helene  recovery and rebuilding. the president mentioned a number of times that having a strike at the ports and the hurricane at the same time was very bad for the economy, put a strain on the supply chain he goes on to say, it is critical to building a stronger  economy. talking about this tentative deal the president also repeatedly  said he would not invoke the tap hartley act to get the union and port operators back to the negotiating table and keep the ports open we know from sources that the white house played a key role in getting this agreement done and  getting these two parties back to the table so here is where sources are telling cnbc at 5:30, just yesterday, white house chief of staff jeff  zients, julie su, pete buttigieg and the director of the national economic council lael brainard,  they met with usmx to emphasize  the need to reopen the ports,  especially after hurricane helene again, something the president just mentioned in his statement. we're told those officials together, they pressured usmx to make an offer before the end of  thursday and they promised to  get the union back to the table. this group of white house  officials met five times over  the day yesterday, according to  sources, to finalize the strategy that would eventually lead to this tentative deal that we're told was reached in the  late afternoon, early evening on thursday the question is what if any  impact this strike will have for every day of the strike, we  should expect a week of  congestion and backlog of the  ports. estimates vary on the daily  impact of the strike economically, ranging from half  a billion dollars to $4 billion  a day. also a question about the impact on holiday prices and inflation. i emailed with the chief economist of ernst & young, he doesn't expect any inflation due to the strike or any economic  impact he said it was too short if it would have been longer,  you would have seen some of  that in the markets, big downside moves in shipping stocks like  maersk the holiday season changes that  narrative. we're seeing upside moves in other transportation stocks like fedex, jb hunt, the biggest  container shipper in the u.s back over to you.  >> is there a feeling that these issues are going to be resolved  in january or that this is going to be a difficult conversation,  particularly around automation and we're putting things off for a few months at this point >> reporter: i reached out and spoken to the two sides, but they didn't get into the weeds about the negotiations but automation certainly is a  very contentious issue so right now globally, just to give you context, 4% to 5% of  container shipping facilities  are automated or semiautomated,  but that range of automation varies there is conflicting studies when it comes to what automation means for jobs so just, you know, put this in context, the west coast port workers, they commissioned a study a few years ago and found  over a course of two years automation costs their union to  lose 5% of jobs. at the same time, around the same time period, the pacific  maritime association, excuse me, they represent the port  operators on the west coast, they commissioned a study and  found automation didn't lead to  loss of any jobs globally we're seeing some kind  of different conflicting ideas you look at the international  ports, the union work with the port operators to try to ensure  jobs and als<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Countdown to September jobs report: Here's what to expect<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> don't know polled forecasters expect an increase of around 150,000 non-farm payroll numbers in  september. joining us now is michelle gerard head of coverage at natwest and  ceo of natwest markets with the estimates fresh in our  mind, michelle, you are at 100,  which is below, an  uptick of te employment rate. you think it will be weaker than what's indicated by the  consensus? >> slightly weaker although, fortunately, the trend is, not up last month, but we  get upward surprises, they are followed by downward revisions i think that's something we're all kind of mindful of even if we get a stronger number than  what we're looking for, we will  see it accompanied to downward months that's not a trend that's  encouraging. our number without any revisions to the prior month would put the three-month moving average at  110,000. that is a sharp downtick from  running 200,000 per month of payroll gains over the first half of the year whether it is 100 or 150,000,  the message is going to be there's slowing clearly in the pace of hiring >> the fed can argue that, yeah, we did 50, but it was really like 25 from the meeting where we didn't do it and another 25 and michelle girard says it is 110. they probably feel pretty good about the steps they have taken. they can certainly justify them. >> i think you're right. i think the fact it has taken an aggressive step given how high interest rates are versus  neutral. there's a lot of ground to make  up we heard goolsbee talking about  the fact that interest rates need to come down a lot. i think he's just recognizing  the fed is still in a pretty restrictive posture given the  fact we have seen tangible slowing on the economy and inflation is moving within range of the fed's target. they have that 2% target i think we all believe somewhere between 2% and 2.5% is where the fed feels comfortable. we expect to move in that and be that by the end of the year. we expect unemployment rate  ticking higher we have it stepping back by the  end of the year. we think that will be at 4.5%. g again, given all that where the  inflation rate is, we feel the fed would feel more comfortable  with rates closer to the neutral posture. >> i guess so. you think the fed was holding  its -- it's not a thing that could do that. the members of the fed,  collectively, were holding their breath with the port strike or is there continued angst about the oil? >> there are a lot of issues the fed is looking at and the port strike is obviously something  the fed -- with the economy and  inflation not positive trends. let's face it, that's probably something's transitory >> that word's banned. >> i know. i tell you, joe, one of the  things we're starting to pick up is the uncertainty around the  election and we saw that in the  beige book and we saw that in  commentary yesterday comments in response to the ism  non-manufacturing survey we are hearing companies saying  they are holding off on  decisions including hiring with  the outcome of the november  election there's a number of headwinds i  think the economy is facing  around uncertainty that, you know, the fed is mindful of in terms of, you know, again, wanting to position the fed to be able to support an economy  that is cooling for a bunch of reasons. >> is 110 okay for a soft  landing? that plays right into what they're trying to accomplish, i  guess. >> it is, but 110 is probably -- unfortunately, you are probably  110 heading sub-100 if the trend extends. we talked about many times the margin for error in terms of the numbers, if you are seeing job gains sub-100, you are seeing an outright decline in payrolls just to get a sense of the fact  that trend is not one -- if we settled around 100 and held  there, but i think everything  we're looking at -- one of the things is looking at the breadth of the job gains really narrow in the month of  august a lot of exclamation points, if you will, suggesting the labor market is certainly softening. >> we're at 385. that's been ticking up on the  ten-year it was 4 where it was with the fed rate cuts on the horizon is that okay >> it's interesting because you  do see the treasury yields moving down as you expected when the fed cuts interest rates. one of the factors we have to  keep in mind is the deficit  remains very large we are still seeing a great deal of fiscal stimulus and a lot of  treasury supply. the idea that ten-year yields or market rates can get as low as we have seen historically when the fed cuts inter<br>
