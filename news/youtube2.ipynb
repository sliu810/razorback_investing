       "      <td>from change research on the race for the white house in the wake  of president biden's decision  not to seek a second term. joining us now, betsy app,  change research lead analyst in  2020. change research was shown to be  among the most accurate polling  in battleground states for the  latest poll, a total of 2,137  interviews were conducted with  registered voters from july 22nd to the 24th. the model margin of error is  2.4%. and here are some of the  results. if the election were held today, who would you vote for, this was before the debate on june 27th,  and former president trump was  up by four points. a month later, in the 2024  election held today, who would  you vote for, harris 44 and  trump 43. and that's not totally different than what we have seen, betsy. i'm looking at the rcp results  from today. and confirming or at least  similar to yours was the reuters ipsos which had vice president  harris up two, but immediately,  i think you saw this, people  said, all right, the sampling of that group, there were 402  democrats and 361 republicans  that were sampled. do you have the same breakdown  in yours? do you know how that broke down  in your samplings? how many republicans versus how  many democrats? >> that's a great question. and we don't really know what  the electorate will look like in november. that's one thing that's really  reshaping right now in the wake  of biden's announcement that  he's withdrawing from the  presidential race. and so, we're trying to model  what we think that electorate  will look like. we're seeing increased  motivation among some key groups of voters. in fact, 44% of the registered  voters that we interviewed are  saying that they're more motivated to vote in the wake of biden's withdraw and harris'  near certain nomination. so, i think all of us pollsters  are doing our best to predict  what that likely electorate --  >> i was asking whether you knew of the -- this poll that you  just told us about, where vice  president harris was up by -- do you know the political  affiliation of the sample that  you used? here's the reason i ask. if you look at the rcp average  today, the cnn -- the average  has trump up 1.7%. cnn up 3. npr, up one. the reuters poll had vice  president harris up 2. but then quinnipiac, trump up 2. n consult, trump up 2. yahoo! a tie. forbes, trump up 6. cbs news, trump up 3. fox news, up 1. emerson, trump was up 6. so the reuters poll, you could  call it almost an outlier, not  an outlier, but they did  oversample democrats. did you oversample democrats in  your poll? >> we did not oversample  democrats, no. i think one thing that is  really --  >> so what were the numbers.  >> -- to wait on --  >> what were the numbers that  you did for political  affiliation? >> we don't ask people's party  affiliation, but we do ask who  did you vote for in the 2020  presidential election. what we're finding is that that  is a key variable in addition to other demographic  characteristics, geographic  characteristics, that help us  understand who the likely voters will be.  >> definitely a lot of -- the  enthusiasm is matched now. that was a problem with biden  and it is definitely trump  voters are much more  enthusiastic, but now maybe even on democrats, maybe they may  exceed the enthusiasm.  >> i was going to say, when you  ask them what they voted four  years ago, then you try to match it up for even number of biden  and trump supporters from four  years ago? >> that's exactly right. yes. so, biden won nationally by  roughly four points. that's what we're seeing in our  polls. i'm sure that's what the other  pollsters are seeing as well. >> how often do you take these  measurements and how often do  they change, i guess? if i'm looking for a vix  measure, a volatility measure as we would say for the stock  market. >> sure. yeah. we're measuring all the time. rarely do we see shifts of this  magnitude. in fact, it is exciting to see,  frankly, as a pollster who has  been measuring this race that  has been largely stagnant  january through up until the  june debate. >> do you -- there was an  interesting -- i think i saw  it -- i read so much, but  buttigieg is still the favorite. the core democrats, right? and although mark kelly is  getting a lot of attention as  well. do you have -- what do you think finally happens there? do you have poll numbers on what should happen, betsy? >> we do. well, we do. i think there are a lot of  variations that go into  selecting a running mate. among voters, voters are  excited, 23% say that they are  excited about the possibility of transportation secretary pete  buttigieg being kamala harris'  running mate. but not too far behind is u.s.  senator from arizona, mark  kelly, with 20%. i will say that mark kelly's  support among voters is more  regionally specific. it is more driven by voters in  the southwest, voters in  arizona. >> yeah. trying to -- there is a lot that goes into it, right? you don't want to necessarily  take a popular senator away from a state, necessarily, or a  governor. pennsylvania is such a huge --  >> that's a big decision in  arizona, absolutely. >> and if yo</td>\n",

is there another way to say that so you don't have to devlve int  it? you think trump will win the  white house or the betting  markets? >> the second. the betting market of a 65%  trump white house. the biggest beneficiary is m&a  and small cap stocks.  >> that's the link. you think we have seen a trump  trade. even after the betting markets  have moved somewhat, he's come  down. vice president kamala harrishas moved up since the weekend when  the news came out. you still think that's at play  from here on and not just to  explain the rotation that we've  already seen and you think it  will continue? >> that's right. from this point forward, there  is an opportunity in msmall cap. part of that is when the fed  cuts, that is good for small  caps and the regional banks. it boosts m&a. there is a lot of overlap with  the fed cut imminent and trump  white house. that's why the interplay is  positive for small kacaps. >> i still don't understand. you don't think the large caps  are done. you just think it's a slowdown  for the s&p 500? >> that's right. i think the mag seven was very  attractive at the start of the  year because growth was scarce  and they had great visibility. they're not expensive. 27 times earnings isn't  demanding. now there's a visible catalyst  for small caps, investors are  taking profits. nasdaq was up 20% and putting it in small caps.  >> we were talking earlier about the mag seven in particular and  the spending on the cloud. if alphabet's results are  indicative of what we will hear  from microsoft and amazon next  week where it comes to the cloud where they are spending more  than what they are able to bring in at this point, is this a  problem? it feels there is a little bit  of a sentiment shift even if it  is a brief one and early on.  >> i agree. i think perception is important  for equity valuations. the money spent by the companies in a.i. has a high expected  return because they have moats  that are getting stronger. there aren't companies like this anywhere else in the world, so  they're very scarce. i don't think it is wasted  capital. if investors want free cash  flows and 11 pe stocks, that is  becoming attractive. >> flat s&p, but russell or  small cap gain of 15% in the  month. >> yes. that's right. i think for the month of august, small caps can do something --  more than 15% even because they  under perform dramatically and  the type of move we have seen in the last two weeks is something  that only happens at the start  of the pretty significant  advance for small caps.  >> do you think the earnings  that we see for the big caps  will they continue to confirm  your case that maybe -- could  anyone blow their results out of the water and change this for  big caps and say, wow, we're  wrong and things are still okay. yesterday was 600 plus points. it had a lot to do with  earnings. not completely. it seemed like it was ready to  happen anyway. do you think there will be  surprises in that group? >> i think so. at the end of the day, i don't  think these companies are not  capable of positive surprise. a lot of good news was baked n.  the line in the sand ultimately  will be nvidia when they report. they are the last one to report. over the next ten years, the  outlook is good for all these  companies. i don't think investors should  lose faith. profit taking doesn't make  sense.  >> i think we will continue to  have you back on. yo</td>\n",

>> i think there we had a lot of algorithmic capabilities for  some time. but gen a.i. is an area of  focus. with an antifinancial crime, we  rolled out a process, i think  250 of our clients now are using this tool that really helps take down the time to research  potential, control activity, and research entities within their  banks by about 90% and so it is  really exciting there. and we also have a new tool that we launch in our investment  platform that summarizes the  meeting minutes from pension  boards, which then allows asset  managers to look at  understanding the strategies  that they might be par taking  in, and it gives them a leg up  in terms of their sales  opportunities there. so those are the types of things we try to do to enable a.i.  inside the products.  >> your chart looks great for  the year. one year, a gain of more than  23%. we have seen a lot of activity,  a lot of excitement about ipos  coming back and you got the  biggest ipo of the year, that is happening today at nasdaq. it comes a day after we have  seen the biggest drop in tech  stocks since 2022. and it has got people a little  bit on edge. it has been remarkably calm, it  has been remarkably steady in  terms of the upward climb for  technology stocks too. what do you see right now in  terms of demand for ipos and  where the market stands? >> we have seen a slow  progression of ipos coming back  to the market. we're so pleased to have lineage come and ipo on nasdaq today. very excited about that. we had a good week also with one stream and going public  yesterday. so, but it has been a slow  progression this year. and i think that's really still  the result of the monetary  policy still, the cost of  capital still being high, trying to understand when the monetary  policy could take down the cost  of capital, as well as just the  overall environment around us  continues to be very dynamic. generally, though, if you look  at our index business, it is a  good bellwether, our index  business is up 29% year over  year. you still -- as you mentioned,  there has been strong progress. but every day is a little bit of an adventure in the markets, and this week we have seen a fair  amount of adventure. >> and, it is such a strange  situation when you look at ipos. they want a strong stock market, they also want lower rates. you look at both of those  issues. what happens if they get the  rate cut, but the stock prices  come down? what is the calculus? >> it is a great question. on the one hand, the reason why, of course, the reason why the  fed has kept monetary policy as  tight as -- as high as it has, i think that is because of the  fact that we really wanted to  bring down inflation. and but now inflation is coming  down, also because of the higher cost of capital it is bringing  down gdp growth. so it is a delicate dance that  the fed has to navigate in terms of when is the right time to  start to ease off and bring down the cost of capital, meaning  bringing down rates, without  waiting too long for that gdp  growth to really slow down too  much. i think that's the delicate  dance. we're getting to the point,  though, where you're seeing  inflation at least approaching  2%. you're seeing the average  consumer starting to have more  challenge with the higher cost  of capital. and so i think that you're  feeling like now is getting to  be the time where change of the  monetary policy would be welcome by the markets.  >> what would you rather have,  though, when you're looking at  the ipo market, a strong market  or lower interest rates? >> i think the question is are  the interest rates really  sustainable where they are,  given the gdp growth of the  country? right now we have a 2% to 2.5%  gap between where the interest  rates are and what the overall  fundamental growth of the  country is. that's a pretty big gap. so, they could bring down the  rates and still have really  healthy markets. having a lower cost of capital  for companies overall is going  to be -- could be a boost to  growth. and so, it is not necessarily an either/or, it could end up being an and.  >> it is less than a week since  the biggest global i.t. outage  we have seen in history took  place here. there were some markets overseas that had trouble starting up  because of the microsoft  crowdstrike implementation of  that new line of code. there were no problems here. nasdaq opened on time, it was  great. if you looked at other airlines, there were massive outages  around the globe, some of those  companies got up and running  more quickly than others, delta  still kind of having some delays and issues that have been out  there, and people say that it  was because it was so reliant,  so heavily reliant, maybe more  than half of its systems reliant on microsoft for that. you always talked about the  importance of redundancies. what happened last week, how did you deal with it, and, you know, what is the lesson you take away from this, watching how this  played out? >> yeah, so our markets were  unaffected and the technology  that we provide to other market  operators around the world were  unaffected and the technology we provide to our clientele was  unaffected. we were, you know, we were  largely unaffected. we had some internal pcs that  were affected. redundancies is critically  important as well as thinking  about your architecture,  understanding how the software,  both your own save the ware and  third party software is  integrated into the solutions,  and making sure that you're  thinking about that from a  redundancy perspective is a  critical part of building that  resilience. our clients rely on us. we are a critical infrastructure provider ourselves. we provide critical  infrastructure technology to</td>\n",

it's a roll up a lot of  family-owned, called lineage  because of all the individual  companies that go into this now, it's a trust? >> call it our pedigree of the  families that have become part  of lineage. it was a fragmented industry. capital intensive because of the real estate. our sorry's been start with one  warehouse and we've done 116  acquisitions to turn lineage  into what it is today. it's amazing. so many family whose we bought  companies from rolled equity  into lineage as part of their  transaction. celebrating with us here today  as well. it's super exciting.  >> so the structure of it, why  does it make sense? as a reit? it doesn't make sense any  other -- because you what you  said? capital intensive real estate  involved? >> joe, you nailed it. our first mode, real estate,  second is technology. really special centralized data  asset we've created. we touch over 400 billion pounds of food a year.  >> say that again.  >> we touch over 400 billion  pounds of food a year.  >> are you sure? 400 billion? >> saying it a lot of time. a lot of food moving around the  world and it comes through our  warehouses and we are that food  infrastructure and tell people  open your fridge or freezer all  that product had to go somewhere and it's come through our  warehouses, a lot of that food.  >> you are eight light. showed a picture of trucks. not a lot of refrigerator  trucks? that's another --  >> obviously warehouse, a  totally different story. why we're structured on the  reit. solution business, basically  everything in our warehouse  chaim from somewhere and going  somewhere ems. our kind of secret sauce help  our customers do that bretter. a huge opportunity to save  costs. put more efficiently truck  volume together and a great  statability as well.  >> goes through the warehouse  quickly?

>> yes.  >> and exciting part of this  whole thing, you can do good, do well while doing good.  >> do you have everything in  these warehouses? everything? >> you got it. you'd be amazed what comes to  your freezefreezer. go to the high-end warehouse,  the sushi has been in our  warehouse.  >> anything you don't have in  there? >> a great question.  nothing we can tell you about. >> right.  >> got your hands on everything  that people are eating. it's really no good, if it stays out.  >> perishable stuff. truly the best way to preserve  product without preservatives  like salt. freeze it, just as good as when  it came out of the ground. frozen and fresh, but --  >> and --  >> we're global business. in 19 countries. close to 500 warehouses around  the world and that's really  because the global food supply  chain is global. our biggest customers use us  across all continents, across  10, 20, 50 buildings.  >> i'd like to see that. how does it get to you? farmers and livestock, ranches? it comes to you? they way? >> comes out of, think about the kind of food chain. food has to be harvested, grown  or produced somewhere. >> okay.  >> goes into our freezer and  then we forward, distribute that product to another warehouse  where it's distributed out to  krogers and walmarts or  restaurants of the world. but that food has to move  through the supply chain. comes out of a field goes to a  freezer and turns into -- think  about the life of a strawberry. comes out of a field. it kurn into a smoothie, or turn it into a jam or ice cream. all the different ways that  strawberry can travel on its  journey. uncrestable sandwiches we know  and love, come from our  freezers.  >> can you give me a quick idea  why things cost so much more  over the past couple years? do you see it, too? where was the main increases  that you had to pass along? what was it from? >> yeah. labor costs, growth. we have 26,000 members around  the world.  >> 26,000? >> yeah.  >> they do incredible work. they work in the cold. it's really cold in there and we really value the partnership  with them.  >> amazing.  >> invested a ton in retention  and the culture of being at  lineage. wage is a huge part of that. super excited. this ipo a broad-based equity  plan to make our team members  ownsers of the company as well. we have a huge belief in, you  know, our entrepreneurial  journey about ownership and  having pride in what we do and  we're so excited. quick shoutout to ownership  works, nonprofit supported us  and this team instituting this.  >> o</td>\n",

what would you do? tell us, finally be honest with  us. be honest, finally.  >> i think today's gdp report  will take july. there is a little bit of  residual talk about july i think it will get taken off the table  here with this report. this is reassuring that the  first half growth rate was  probably underlying growth rate  probably between 2 and 2.5%. pretty close to potential growth rate of the economy.  inflation news, just very  recently, it's been good, but  the committee has two more  reports before theseptember  meeting and will want to see  those. i think, i think the committee's on a pretty good track here at  the july meeting to not signal  too strongly that they're  probably about ready to go in  september and beyond that. >> in recent weeks you can sort  of feel the perception growing  that the labor market may be  slowing and maybe even more than people think, and i saw someone  throw in the towel. i guess it was dudley. you saw dudley's comments, i  guess. right? >> yeah.  >> he said, okay. i was wrong.  we need to cut now to make sure  it doesn't get worse.  oh. there it is. i can't believe that. i did not plan that. but the fed needs to cut rates  now to make, to stem what could  be something even worse in the  labor market. is that wrong? that could be wrong. >> i don't think the probability of recession is any higher right now than it is in ordinary  times. of course, we live with the  probability at any time there  could be a recession, could be a big shock, but i don't think  these numbers are really  pointing to recession at this  point. this is more normalization in  the labor market. the number of job openings per  unemployed workers a couple  years ago was two. that came down to 1.2, which is  the pre-pandemic number, but  that's still very high compared  to when we were talking 2013,  2014. that period it was way below 1. i think we've got normalization  in labor market. we've got inflation just 50, 60  basis points away from target. you've got the economy growing  at potential. this is a soft landing, and the  last piece of the soft landing  is to get the policy rate back  to normal, a more normal level,  and get the yield curve upward  slowly, which should also be  happening.  >> on almost any metric you look at in terms of the first friday  of every month, or the gdp  numbers, it's -- surprising  almost for, i guess, at least a  year. maybe 18 months. is it -- is it good? is it better productivity? is it residual government  stimulus? is it the size of the fed's  balance sheet? i know -- no. of course not, because you were  a part of that, but what do you  attribute it to? how has it been so surprisingly  resilient for so long? and is it a -- is it because of  good things or because of -- i  mean, we did have inflation. that's what happens when there's too many dollars floating  around. was that it? or is it productivity  improvement?  >> i'm optimistic that  productivity's improving. it's notoriously hard to  measure, and you know, my gut  instinct is that you are getting pretty good productivity, but if you look at the numbers, they're not really there yet, and so  we'll have to see if that story  holds. i think another thing that  happened here was last year, you had this overwhelming prediction by wall street and global  financial markets that the u.s.  would go into recession in the  second half of 2023 based on the problems at svb. that turned out to be epically  wrong. instead of shrinking in the  second half of 2023, the economy boomed, and i think that just  set everybody scrambling to  change their ideas. but the big picture is that the  economy is slowing and has been  slowing for a while, but that's  because it was growing way above trend post-pandemic. it's not slowing to a  recessionary situation, but just to the trend pace of growth, and that makes a lot of sense. you would grow rapidly after the big shock, and then you'd slow  down to the potential growth  rate. i think that's exactly what's  happening. that's the soft landing. >> so, you think that you grow  rapidly after what we went  through, but it just seems like  it's been of a longer duration  than anyone thought. does any of it have to do  with --  >> i kind of agree with that,  but this was -- if you look at  the charts, i mean, just a  gigantic shock, and you really  had to dig out from that. it was pretty much a v-shaped  recovery as far as  macroeconomics is concerned. you'll probably never see  anything quite as v-shaped, but  still, it takes a long time to  recover from such a big tsunami. >> interesting. but i guess the infrastructure  and the chips and i.r.a., none  of that hurt in terms of  stimulating some demand. i mean, we got a lot of that  left to still spend too. did that have any --  >> i was surprised the other  day. a lot of that has not been  spent, and i think it tells you  that that kind of expenditure is really more about the public  infrastructure over the medium  term and the long run and  probably doesn't affect business cycle-type dynamics that  financial markets worry about  quite as much, so yes, there's  some public projects that move  forward, but m</td>\n",

       "      <td>look at shares of lazard. up almost 10% this morning as  the company beats earnings and  revenue estimates for the second quarter. reports record revenue for the  financial business for the first half of the year. lazard aims to double from  revenue by 2030. ceo peter orszag joins us to  discuss the results and the  election too as a formatter  member of the obama  administration. the stock level higher since  2021, what's driving it? >> we're executing against it. it's exciting to see. i think we're at an inflection  moment as we continue to execute against our long-term growth. if anything, we're ahead of  schedule. we've got to keep going. that's what we're going to keep  going.  >> the m & a markets remain  challenging, so what's the story there? >> we've been doing a lot of  hiring. we have we saw a significant increase in advisory revenue. also in our business of raising  funds and equity in the  secondary part of it. >> what about the outlook for  the recovery and m&a. what is your accepts of where  this goes? >> we see increasing momentum in terms of client traction. it's not going to be linear, so  the overall trajectory coming up i think is positive but it won't be the nature of the advisory  business is not always one on  top of the other. and a big further spur to  activity as inflation comes down and the fed cuts rates. that will bring sponsors in the  playing field. it will spur further strategic  deal making and then the other  side of the business on our  asset management business, it  will cause increased inflows  into active management. >> peter, i wonder on the list  of dynamics that might make the  m&a picture more constructive,  is it more about price at the  moment or what regulation may  bring in the future? >> look, there have been over  the past few years several  headwinds on price divergences  between buyers and sellers  partly in financing, partly on  regulatory. those are all tending to fade. as the rate environment looms,  the spreads tend to narrow. financing is clearly more  available and regulatory here in the u.s., the deterrent effect  may be longer than five years  ago. because the government has lost  several prominent cases in  court, the deterrent effect is  smaller than it was a year or  two ago. in other words c suites are  saying the law hasn't changed. you're interpreting in a  different way but we'll see you  in court. >> the asset management, i know  you were asking about it on the  earnings call as well. that half of the business has  lagged. what has been the story there  and is the ability to leverage  the strength that you're seeing  in advisory to boost asset  management? >> yeah, i think the common  unlock there is as inflagstion s occurred as the fed turns to  rate cuts because one of the  impediments in that business has been when interest rates are  high like in the higher for  longer environment, more tends  to stay on the sidelines in the  form of money market funds and  t-bills. as interest rates come down,  those alterp ifnatives are less  attractive. at the same time we are starting perhaps to see a rotation into  value investing, and that</td>\n",
