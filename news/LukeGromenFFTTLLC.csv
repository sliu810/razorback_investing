Initial thoughts on JPY carry trade unwind volatility and potential implications,2024-08-07 17:00:13+00:00,24,L3OFI3_OhBc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3OFI3_OhBc,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hey everybody luke groman fft hope everybody had a great weekend it's a beautiful weekend of weather here i hope you all had a chance to enjoy it if it was nice by you as well going to jump right into the questions from earl what month do you think the fed will pivot august i've been saying by the end of 3q 22 at the latest uh what has happened in credit markets over the last couple weeks has brought that forward for me so that's that's what i think at this point uh from david recession seems guaranteed when the fed pivots can more qe levitate stocks in such a recession i agree that i think the recession is now fair to complete and and yes i do think that more qe will send stocks higher from pa what if the fed is willing to punish the u.s economy in order to save the dollar is there no way they could slow walk the tightening while a new administration basically cuts government spending in my opinion it's sort of what they're doing what the whole point of this uh tightening uh really is i think when you when you talk about fighting inflation you're really talking about defending the dollar um so i think they're i think they're doing that but in my opinion they're not willing and they will never be willing to punish washington dc they'll punish the regular america they'll punish the economy but they won't take it so far as to punish washington dc and by by that i mean if we have a stronger dollar from tightening and a recession you're going to have a shortfall of foreign buyers of treasuries you're already starting to see this in the data article out today japan selling treasuries due to where the dollar is due to the after fx hedge uh yield on u.s treasuries relative to other sovereign debt out there uh and so if you have a shortfall foreign buying a treasuries you either have to do one of three things you either have to cut spending in a recession uh at the federal level and with federal government 22 percent of gdp that's going to make the recession a lot worse the deficits a lot higher non-linearly or you're going to see yields on treasuries up in a recession which is highly unusual and again will worsen the recession given the interest rate sensitivity of tax receipts the u.s economy more broadly or the fed buys it with qe and the first two options really amount to the fed standing aside as a debt death spiral effectively with u.s debt to gdp us deficits to gdp this high where you're just gonna have higher interest rates higher dollar lower tax receipts bigger deficits higher interest rates higher dollar washers repeat until either the system collapses or the fed does what they did in april uh march and april 2020 uh which is going to uh expand their balance sheet much faster from mark g luke your premise that the us deficit will rise materially is predicated on much higher interest rates much higher interest expense but with higher rates it will take but higher rates will take quite some time to reflect in higher interest expense even with lower receipts the treasury could the treasury not run a medium-term deficit and the fed not need to pivot the rates are really a small part of it directly speaking historically the dynamic is really that historically in recessions last four recessions we have seen deficits as a percent of gdp rise by one thousand percent of uh excuse me one thousand basis points of gdp and the covet which we'll set aside 800 basis points of gdp and 08 500 basis points of gdp and o1 and 300 basis points of gdp going back to 91. so we've i've not been using the coven thousand basis points of gdp deficit increase although it may be apropos given how high debt levels are across the economy and around the world uh but what we're saying is basically let's just use the middle case of 500 basis points of gdp within the first year of a recession in terms of widening out the deficit as receipts come in sharply lower and uh counter cyclical payments rise with unemployment so 500 base points of gdp that's about a 1.1 trillion dollar increase in treasury issuance at a time where the fed's still theoretically selling treasuries uh the treasury's still selling treasuries to the tune of a trillion too right so the deficit would go to uh one 2.3 trillion fed selling treasuries foreigners are selling treasuries um who the we're talking about the the the effective supply of treasuries going to three or four trillion dollars it's unclear to me uh in a global economy of 80 trillion in gdp growing three percent in a non-recession that's 2.4 trillion of gdp growth against three to four trillion of net treasury issuance effective treasury issuance um who the buyer is at current rates uh and that's assuming global gdp is still growing you start shrinking global gdp that number gets even more backwards you get the stronger dollar flight to safety less foreign buying these are the dynamics where there's just this fundamental supply demand problem for treasuries that has never existed before debt wasn't this high deficits weren't this high dollar not as much offshore dollar debt that required people to sell treasuries to service dollar debt uh there's all these factories that factors that have never happened before and so that's really the dynamic now could the treasury the treasury i think has five or six hundred billion dollars in the treasury general account or tga could they run that down um to buy themselves a few months so they don't have to increase issuance i think they can i think the market will start to see through that pretty quickly because obviously it's only a finite amount of money in there and they don't like to usually drain it below certain levels but they could uh in the short run so that maybe is something that could push out the pivot date where i would be wrong from tf what should ordinary people without a ton of money be doing to prepare themselves to best weather this storm i think you want to be liquid i think you want to be unlevered as much as possible and i think you want to be balanced what we're going through this this first bursting global sovereign debt bubble in 100 plus years centered in the west for the first time in a hundred plus years uh with peak cheap energy peak cheap commodities for the first time ever uh this is the most frightening macro setup i've seen in my career doing this 27 years so it's it is it is not the time to be being brash and being hyper aggressive um i think the where we're getting to quickly is is is like the end game i think is is is pretty crystal clear i think is highly likely which is face peeling printing probably through some version of yield curve control it's already restarted in japan they're moving a little towards it right now we're talking about it in europe i think it's going to come to america as well that's something that's good for gold it's good for bitcoin it's good for commodities equities however it's critical uh as as as as a quote unquote ordinary person in these markets to understand that this is a political event this is a political process so between here and that endgame we're already seeing the mind-boggling volatility uh that that that that has happened and i will likely continue to happen it's a highly political process of what is effectively sovereign default in the west likely to be done via sustained high inflation but again that doesn't mean we can't go through six months in time like we've just had where we're seeing risk off in bonds and stocks in a way that has not happened in at least 50 years i expect these types of oh this hasn't happened in at least 50 years events to become increasingly common and when we talk about balance so you want to be unlevered you want to be borrowing a bunch of money and buying a bunch of of assets you want to be conservatively financed i think you want to maintain a higher than usual liquidity position so more cash than usual when i talk about balance i always go back in my mind to the jacob fugger the the richest man in history as a percent of global gdp supposedly and how he generated and passed down generational wealth with a very simple model 25 cash 25 gold 25 stocks 25 real estate rebalance when one gets out of whack with the others if you want to inject a little bit coin on the gold part if you want to inject a little bit of bonds with the stocks part or some commodities with the stocks uh part go for it i think there's different things you can do in real estate but that's what i mean about balance that that is balance so uh from dale why did oil drop so severely last week that's a good question that was what i was asking myself and other relationships in the business over the weekend the short answer is i don't know there were rumors of peace talks there were potentially the biden export bans some concerns about the impacts of that the fuel export bans that the biden administration is now talking about essentially out of political desperation uh demand fears as maybe the economy is slowing down although the the highway data the fuel usage data in the us at least don't seem to be supporting that at least yet just extreme positioning it doesn't take a whole lot if everybody's really bullish on energy and i know we are um it doesn't take a lot to get it to sell off a little bit in the other direction so i i don't really know those are some of the thoughts that i had heard over the weekend as possible explanations but i don't have a great explanation for you so i apologize uh from jeff here's my question if you were right but the fed is either in denial or doesn't get it yet what will break as they get it wrong or perhaps more concise how long can the fed keep pushing rates out before they're forced to relent what are endpoint conditions uh the stuff that'll break is the stuff that's already breaking uh bitcoin first stocks bonds mortgages treasuries high yield um and really it's stocks high yield mortgages um foreign sovereign treasury market uh housing you're starting inventories build tax receipts which are starting to get weak uh in may although it's a noisy data series everything we're seeing is what i'd expect to see breaking if they're starting to make a policy mistake on the downside so i think they really want to see oil and gas break i think they've effectively been co-opted into the geopolitical fight against putin and russia i just don't think they're going to be able to get oil and gas down a whole lot without doing critical damage to the u.s and western economies more broadly multiple questions about powell's comment last late last week that rapid changes in the global monetary system may affect future international roll of the u.s dollar then what my thoughts were around that here's another one i don't know it's a very odd thing for the federal reserve chairman to say i'm not sure if it was just a boilerplate warning type of legalese uh or if he's hearing something or or being debriefed on something i mean i russia could certainly do something in retaliation that would have have that effective impact right they could shut off the gas taps to europe they could say that's it we're only taking gold for our gas we're only taking bitcoin bitcoin for our oil in theory um saudi could do something similar hey we're now pricing oil in yuan uh and settling effectively uh at least some of it in gold that i i think a saudi announcement about yuan a russian announcement about gold uh would probably fit into the rapid changes in the global monetary system but until i see something else i i just have to believe it's probably just boilerplate i don't know the context of the question and then finally two questions that were sort of related could you explain why ten-year bond yields rising to three to four percent is bad and will force the fed to turn if a few years ago they were much higher italy and germany 10-year yields were doubled just 10 years ago why will rising yields force the ecb to turn two and luke could you please talk about the mounting sovereign debt crisis that now appears to be understood more broadly what you believe the awareness acknowledgement and response of the fed may be in coming weeks so i i think a key difference here is inflation's finally here right inflation's here and and and that is problem one and then secondly the debt levels in the west are much higher post covered and and so the issue is the amount of rate hikes needed to stop the inflation is likely to bankrupt the sovereigns because the debt's so high and so i i think i i agree there is greater awareness i still think it's in the minority it's not mainstream yet there's still a lot of mainstream policy makers out there that think the us can pull up a volcker a paul volcker to fight inflation but i do think an an aha moment uh is coming in the next couple months when u.s and global economic data i think have a chance of getting bad enough where inflation's not coming down that fast uh that suddenly there's this recognition that they can't type much more um and that i think that is a i think that will be reinforced by i think the u.s treasury's seeing tax receipts come in below expectations for several months in a row where they have to come out and say well we weren't going to issue much in the second or third quarter but now we've got to increase treasury issuance because tax receipts are coming in below expectations and if you increase treasury issuance into what we're already seeing is this uh sub-optimal u.s treasury supply demand dynamic which is part of the reason why yields are rising that may also really be an aha moment or a forcing factor where uh the treasury market sovereign debt markets more broadly get dysfunctional again you argue arguably we're already seeing that a bit in japan and europe in the last couple of weeks it's strange credulity i think if we're already seeing japan and europe that the fed won't be forced to follow so i think we're seeing a lot of the signposts of a breakdown or an acceleration in the in the global sovereign debt bubble bursting um and that's part of the reason why i think the fed's going to be forced to pivot by the end of 3q 22 at the latest probably earlier so with that i'm going to finish up

"“USD Dutch Disease”, how it has hurt US manufacturing, & more",2024-07-24 17:00:18+00:00,14,Uh72BwY0CRc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh72BwY0CRc,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fftt hope everybody is well and has had a great weekend uh busy weekend of baseball and actually my oldest son's birthday as well so had a lot of fun uh so let me with that preamble jump right into it first question comes from david can you give a two-minute articulation of your electro electric vehicle slash peak cheap oil hypothesis uh yeah i think it's it's pretty straightforward so for cheap oil i think is a key way to phrase it and and really the case is the biggest incremental increase in oil supply since 2005 678 pick your date uh has been from u.s shale globally and u.s shale producers over the last five six seven years have increasingly high graded their wells which means they've produced their most attractive acreage to maximize cash flows particularly during the 2014 to 2016 downturn and now having high graded a lot of their best acreage uh they are now having a harder time overcoming depletion rates that have always been around three to five percent per month in that industry depending on uh the prior two years worth of production so the faster they ramp production uh the higher the depletion rate goes initially and when they cut production the depletion rate actually falls uh which is a little counterintuitive but that's just how the business works so right now they've high graded the wells uh a lot of the best acreage and you've got a depletion rate at the big the four biggest shale fields that are right now running around sixty percent per year five percent per month so at the same time uh a disproportionate percentage of conventional oil supplies uh come from a relatively few uh major oil fields uh that are now uh you know when you look at the list of super giant oil fields as matt simmons called them almost 20 years ago they are now all almost 50 somewhere between 55 and 100 years old and all of these fields uh almost all oil fields have have followed some version of a bell curve uh your ramp production uh your peak and then you start uh see production fall on the other side so people forgot about peachy boil because shale came in shale now looks like it's going to be harder and harder more expensive to keep it to keep growth flat or grow grow supply grow grow supplies excuse me and then i i think something that has really hit me in the last two three months is a really big signpost potentially has been audi who's owned by volkswagen the single biggest corporation in germany and the biggest employer in germany gm last week mercedes-benz these companies that have 60 to 80 years plus vested invested into internal combustion engine supply chains uh tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars invested into internal combustion supply chains and they're all now talking about taking significant portions or all of their production to electric vehicles within five years and so to me it just doesn't make sense it suggests there's two options number one these companies are willing to bet their companies on uh electric vehicles uh completely reorganize their massive supply chains on what amounts to basically betting the company on virtue signaling that's one option or the other option is there is a supply issue coming and these nation these companies by virtue of being as big as they are have been tapped on the shoulders by their governments saying hey start reorganizing your supply chains this is coming don't get caught by surprise and to me uh it's strange credulity that the ceo of a major automaker would bet his company on uh virtue signaling i just don't think that's that's how uh executives work so with that said to me i i think uh we're about to see pete g boyle come back as a major theme in a major way in coming quarters and years i think it's really good for oil prices i think it's really good for broad commodities i think it's really good for metals and particularly uh and industrials within the electron electric vehicle supply chain so that is the i took a little bit longer than two minutes but i think it's a pretty important thing to start paying an increased amount of attention to particularly since oil remains pretty hated a second question from pete at what point is the world going to realize that we have a fossil fuels energy return on invested energy in other words the amount of the number of oil barrels you have to invest to get a barrel of oil back that number uh a hundred years ago call it was you get a hundred barrels back for every barrel you invested so to speak and that number has been shrinking over time continues to shrink that's an er energy return on invested energy problem or e-r-o-i-e problem uh and then when that happens how long do you expect dollar reserve uh currency expected dollar reserve currency won't producers and commodity exporters want some sort of tangible wealth to represent declining reserves i think it's a great question i think it gets to the crux of a number of issues if keeping oil supplies flat to up slightly requires significant sustained ongoing increases in oil prices which is really what we're talking about when we talk about peak jeep oil then a nation would have to be to be blunt either an idiot or afraid of being invaded by the us uh to hold their national wealth in treasuries yielding negative real rates which is happening now but in particular uh holding it in treasuries when peach boil means those treasuries mathematically have to buy less oil every single year on average permanently and or at least until you find you get prices high enough that you can significantly ramp up oil production this is a problem in particular for europe china japan uh south korea as well which are creditor nations or regions that are also major oil importers uh and so you can't those those nations can't hold treasuries that lose seven eight ten fifteen percent of their value against oil every year because pretty soon they're gonna have a currency crisis because they won't have enough um uh the real wealth of their country relative to the critical import of oil uh will evaporate oh not not that in not too long a period of time uh to me that then to to address your question is that it means these these these energy importing creditor nations and regions are going to be highly motivated to shift their fx reserves out of treasuries out of sovereign debt more broadly into wealth assets that can rise to preserve oil purchasing power gold is really the only thing on the central bank list to buy that satisfies that you could also make a case uh that the uh swiss national bank buying equities also works as well japanese have done a little bit of that as well although i don't know that that's what their goal has been so uh for individuals i think bitcoin fits that list as well but i think that is a critical point to make in in looking at okay what are some of the broader macro implications of peak jeep oil next question from mt i would like you to discuss possible immediate catalysts for the fed to turn more dovish and acknowledge the debt situation and its implications for policy will another tightening slash deflationary bust cycle be needed before they get the message uh i think i think the the catalysts uh the possible catalysts that are needed are already in place you've seen the china credit impulse roll over we have the delta variant now we've got commodity prices rolling over um certainly relative to recent highs and so i don't think the fed is ever going to acknowledge the debt situation uh as in we are doing qe because the us's debt situation is unsustainable and we're keeping uh we're financing the government at negative real rates even though that's effectively what they're doing but ultimately in my opinion that's a key driver to to to to what it is and so the question then do we need another bust um possible but unlikely certainly not of of of a very long duration in my opinion and that ties into the next question from jp which is does the path of dollar devaluation matter as much as some people seem to think and in my opinion that depends on your mandate on your investment mandate so if you are a hedge fund or uh somebody who's managing or managing your own money uh on a monthly basis or even on a quarterly basis and a lot as a lot of mutual fund investors do uh it matters greatly absolutely i think it matters greatly the path of of how things play out for the dollar for what the fed does etc for an investor with a lower time preference which by the way i think is a huge advantage these days if you have if you can manage with a lower time preference than someone who has to manage monthly it's a huge advantage but if you have a lower time preference than managing monthly or quarterly then i don't think it matters i don't think the path of a dollar devaluation potentially matters that much uh and the reason i say that is since 2018 we've had sequentially shorter and shorter big drops down and risk off and the fed responding rapidly right so it was a quarter long and 4 q18 and then it was a few weeks long maybe a month long in summer of 19 and ultimately then or early 2020 with covet obviously it's very sharp but it was very brief um you know we had the shortest recession on record two months uh uh in 2020 as we just learned last week uh and so ultimately i think we're in the situation where uh the gaps from the time of of any sort of risk off to when the fed has to step in to keep the treasury market functioning which they have all but laid out as their new third mandate last year those gaps in time have to keep getting shorter and shorter and shorter from the time you have a self to the time the fed steps in the lower your time preference and this i think is critical lower your time preference in other words if you're not a monthly guy or a quarterly person uh managing to a monthly or quarterly mandate uh it simplifies your ques the decision process down to uh ultimately the longer your time horizon down to a single question which is do i think the fed will let the us government default on treasuries or entitlements and when i say default nominally default i mean we're not sending you the money we're not paying treasuries go away we're not paying entitlements go away and that's the question then the longer your time preference and in my view there's zero chance that i can never say zero there's very little chance of that happening uh i think there's it's highly unlikely i do not think the fed will allow that to happen and so then again that allows us to have uh um a greater time preference uh uh uh uh in terms of how we want to structure how we think about things and then the last question is from john luke uh if the u.s completely bans cryptocurrencies do you believe the signals that signals the formal end of us dominance as you've hinted in past fft reports or has anything changed in your view that either makes you think that banning is more or less likely in my opinion i continue to feel how i how i have felt which is to say i don't think the in my opinion that the u.s can outright ban uh cryptocurrencies bitcoin in particular um setting aside any of the mechanical technology aspects which uh in bitcoin in particular i think would be very difficult to do based on what uh some of my friends on the tech angle of that have told me with that said from the macro perspective i don't think the us can outright ban bitcoin because us dollar reserve status requires as it's been structured since 1971 it requires a completely open capital account uh however the us government can maintain a nominally open capital account and make things very difficult in the short run for owners of bitcoin as we've seen in the last uh three four months uh they can threaten regulatory uh uh uh impacts uh they can uh some of which might be good in the long run uh quite frankly they can do a number of things to make people uncomfortable um and we've seen that happen and i think i i don't think that will ultimately matter to bitcoin in the long run uh but in the short run i think it's something you have to be aware of so that's it for tonight i appreciate everybody's questions i hope everybody has a great rest of your weekend and as always if you're interested in finding out more about what

"How a stronger USD pushes the US further into fiscal dominance, and vice versa",2024-07-11 16:00:49+00:00,34,sVqgQN33KvA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVqgQN33KvA,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope everybody had a great weekend going to jump in here with our sunday conversation so thank you for joining me first question comes from gr if you would please discuss in depth the path you see the fiscal stories taking what percentage drop in the stock market would cause the collaboration needed to bail out wall street uh i i think the easiest way to answer this look history is very clear uh over the last 200 to 220 years uh uh 52 out of the 53 countries that got to 130 debt to gdp like the u.s reached last year uh they had to either restructure their their debt their sovereign debt or inflated away especially when it's a twin deficit nation like the u.s there's no case of a twin deficit nation not either restructuring or inflating away their debt in terms of this happening however to your point it's a very political process so um you need to have political cover which obviously stock market drop is a very uh useful convenient has been used before um i would just expect to your point that that would be the cause again my view is a 15 to 20 percent drop in the s p from the highs would be enough uh to spur the fed to stop and possibly temporarily uh quote unquote re-increase qe uh to reverse the taper um that when you think about more fed qe with ongoing federal deficits that's effectively fiscal stimulus right there uh my guess is you'd probably need a 20 to 30 percent drawdown peak to trough for more fiscal to to scare washington uh into providing more fiscal or extending existing uh fiscal spending that is slated to go away whether that be student loan forbearance uh child tax credits uh etc um you know to be clear though i think too this isn't about bailing out wall street 2008 was about bailing out wall street um from now on this is about bailing out washington dc this is about bailing out entitlements this is about bailing out um 50 years of bad decisions uh starting around the time of nixon with closing the gold window uh in any series of particularly after 1989 after the soviet union fell a big uh reason detroit uh resounded a reason for existing uh for a lot of the apparatus for the europe petrodollar system we should have restructured the system at that point we didn't and so we've made us particularly since 89 a series of um horrifically bad foreign policy economic policy choices that were all generally slated toward um act now pay later act now pay later pull demand forward and the bills come and do and so that's what this is a bail this isn't about bailing out wall street anymore this is about bailing out all of us um so it's a little unsherry for right before the holidays but it is what it is second question from th jeff snyder as well as lacey hunt denies qe as money printing do you still disagree yes uh ben bernanke and fed vice chair stan fisher who was bernanke's mentor he was draghi's mentor um he is the godfather as one of my friends called it um as harold mamrum called him he's the ultimate behind the scenes actor this guy is tied in they were both extraordinarily clear on this point federal deficits spent into the economy with the fed engaged in qe is helicopter money i.e money printing i don't think this is particularly controversial the government hands money to people government issues a treasury to banks fed prints money buys the treasury from the bank there is a technicality that that is a bank reserves but again it's already leaked into the real economy via the government spending so unless the fed is going to completely reduce their balance sheet sell all those bonds back into the real economy someday which they say they will but they i mean they won't they can't then it's money printing if the fed doesn't shrink its balance sheet back down to its starting point it's money printing full stop and so um 2008 fed balance sheet was at 800 billion today it's at 8.4 trillion so unless um unless uh we're going the fed's going to be able to reduce its balance sheet by uh what is that 7.4 trillion dollars um sell those bonds back to the global private sector which makes me laugh there's there's no there's no frigging way uh to be blunt um then that's money printing de facto that is money printing so it's helicopter you can read it and ben bernanke's 2002 deflation speech uh you can read it from fed vice chair former fed vice chair stan fisher in 2019 in the black rock white paper august of 2019 both of these are publicly available google them find them online it's money printing it's helicopter money it's money printing deficits plus qe is money printing uh from jeff g if you had to choose fossil fuels or gold and by the way thanks so much for fftt i'll miss it the next three weeks thank you very much very kind jeff uh fossil fuels are gold both uh i i i want to own both i think it's important to understand from two angles number one gold is just energy it's compressed and and portable bitcoin is effectively the same uh gold and bitcoin are effectively batteries in that way just compressed portable energy uh gold at the sovereign level bitcoin for the people uh more importantly if we take a step back and look at peak cheap oil and gas which we're seeing peak cheap copper peak cheap a lot of resources uh which is becoming increasingly obvious um if you look at the data and the amount of evidence piling up it points to needing to uh that the commodities and neutral reserve assets should do well because ultimately uh peak cheap oil and gas and i'm just going to say that peak cheap a lot of commodities peak cheap oil and gas means the death of the traditional 60 40 stocks bond portfolio that's done so well for the last 30 to 40 years the reason that is is that if the fed tightens to try to fight commodity driven inflation then you're going to get modest modest amount of deflation but significant inflation at the back end again because you're not investing enough in energy and this other stuff like you should or if the fed doesn't tighten and lets inflation run hot for a sustain sustained period of time to both work down u.s debt but also to incent the private the global private market the global capitalist market to invest to address these higher prices then you're going to end up with very high prices later shortages later we're seeing shortages around the world of stuff this is no longer uh conspiracy theory tin foil hat stuff we're watching it de facto in europe in asia uh supply chains on the west coast uh etc so the fed is a choice cheap oil and gas means the fed is a choice a lot of inflation on a sustained basis now so that we don't have really bad inflation and shortages later or the fed can try to tighten for a little bit and fight this high inflation now and have really high inflation and shortages later high inflation now or really high inflation later isn't good for bonds either case and so in that case you want to hold a neutral reserve asset not bonds something that floats in value a bond of finite issuance and infinite duration with a floating face value something like gold that's all gold is it's a it's a it's a bond of zero percent coupon finite issuance and infinite duration um and so you want to own bonds with zero percent coupon floating face value and infinite duration uh uh that's gold that's bitcoin neutral reserve assets so i think you want to own both um for those reasons both fossil fuels and gold and bitcoin uh from valuable in a tweet response to macro alf you stated that other countries are not interested in treasuries anymore could you elaborate on this point could you also provide a point why that would not be the case as uh so uh what macro alf said was the u.s stock market represents 44 percent of world stock market cap despite u.s gdp representing less than 25 percent of cumulative gdp why do you think that's the case and i answered because the u.s runs the world's biggest deficits because we have to because we're the world's reserve currency issuer uh the world doesn't want nearly as many treasuries anymore and if i had more characters in twitter that's what i would have said i did say doesn't want treasuries anymore and so what the world's doing is recycling dollars back into u.s stocks instead in plain english what this means is that the post-71 structure of the u.s dollar triffins delamar which has always been known to be coming up is basically uh forcing uh the u.s to trade ownership of u.s stocks and real estate uh for cheap goods for china from china so china sends us cheap goods we send them dollars and instead of buying treasuries they buy stocks and they buy real estate so the reason i said the reason this is happening is is just geopolitical and economic realities you know per the math i ran through before uh regarding uh negative real rates uh etc um the math is clear the the us cannot pay back its debt in anything resembling real terms again once we get to 130 percent that the gdp 220 years of history you restructure or you inflate that's it and with rates already at zero basically uh there's no way to pay back the debt in anything resembling real terms especially when you factor in 110 100 trillion dollars plus in entitlement obligations which is just off balance sheet debt so treasuries have to be certificates of confiscation on a real basis and unlike uh unlike money managers who have to manage to a monthly mandate or a quarterly mandate um sovereigns don't have to manage to they can manage to a multi-year mandate that's very nice for them so uh foreign accreditors just don't see the value in u.s treasury bonds why would you buy a bond that has to yield negative real rates just for the u.s to keep the wheels on the car and the answer is you wouldn't you would buy stocks you'd buy real estate you'd buy gold and that's what they've been doing these foreign creditors have been doing that um and so uh the the you're seeing that in terms of um rising equities rising equities uh market cap as a percent of gdp we've seen that consistently uh you're seeing uh this it's been in rising peas obviously corporate earnings are rising as well but p e's are rising uh faster and and all of this is basically just a natural outcome and early warning of u.s deficit-driven inflation it starts in equities and then it spreads out so it also means that the dollar cannot be allowed to become too strong because foreigners are short dollars through dollar borrowing so dollar gets too strong they start selling u.s equities um to raise dollars uh and the whole system goes into reverse uh goes into a vicious cycle and that sends the us sends the world into recession uh and a recession when everybody's selling dollar related assets including treasuries and the u.s has record deficits to finance and at the gdp of 130 percent it's it's unsustainable you can't do it you would see yields and on treasuries rise into a recession it's called a balance of payments crisis when it happens in places like turkey as we're seeing in real time so um you know over time this turns the this the post 71 structure of the us dollar reserve status is turning the united states into a global tax haven um where the world buys our stocks uh plus we have some some some cool tech and we have shale and we have farms and that's an oversimplification but that's what this drives rather than sort of a more balanced economy geopolitically i didn't touch on that much but adversaries like china russia they would much rather buy gold in the case of russia or u.s equities and real estate in the case of china along with goal then they would own treasuries to finance their own military encirclement uh from nathan g is there a practical difference between the treasury minting a trillion dollar coin and the fed revaluing gold higher or do they effectively serve the same purpose a great question and no there's no effective difference both amount to a significant increase in the money supply without a commensurate increase in debt uh that could theoretically offset the increase in that money supply again remember what i said earlier if the fed buys that debt and never sells it it's money printing it's effectively the same thing if but there's at least the credible thing that snyder hunt others can point to say well that's debt they're gonna have to pay it back someday not if the fed's holding it um only if they want to uh only if it's politically convenient and 12 years and running 13 years of running hasn't been politically convenient has it over the state extended time frame it's not going to be either for the next 10 years in all likelihood uh so yeah effectively minting the coin and revaluing the gold uh on the balance sheet of the united states which then would deposit um whatever amount into the treasury tga treasury general account it's effectively the same thing it's basically money creation without offsetting debt and the final question from peter how did china manage to pop their equity bubble and keep it where they would like without causing recession why can't the usa do the same china is a major surplus nation with a closed capital account u.s is a twin deficit nation uh with an open capital account and the reserve currency u.s deficits recycled into the stock market in the way we talked about before that increases foreign ownership the u.s stock market policy makers as a result of in the us have increasingly allowed the system to evolve such that rising equity prices help create uh tax receipts uh consumer spending uh global demand um and so it means u.s government deficits uh need rising stocks to help fund so it's a giant to help fund it so it's it's a giant circular virtuous cycle uh contingent upon stocks going up into the right at infinite and so uh that and it's china and the us are in the same boat they're tied together at the hip with a very short rope so it's if u.s stocks fell yeah the u.s is going to recession but it ain't good for china either i mean it's going to drag on their economy as well they've been desperately trying to become much more domestic consumption driven they've made great strides in that however a u.s recession would still hurt them tremendously they still have a lot of capacity they have built that is export facing um and and would be negatively affected by a decline in the u.s stock market so it's uh it's a virtuous cycle but it's it or it's it's a it's a it's it's a virtuous cycle as long as stocks are rising china can in theory have more leeway they're less dependent uh they're less acutely dependent on rising u.s stocks but there still are dependent and china has other acute issues that the us does not have around energy and water so um a lot going on with that this is going to be the last video update for 2021 it's been an interesting year to say the least and i'm increasingly thinking 2022 may actually be a lot more interesting than 2021 uh in the broader sense of the word both fortunately unfortunately so let's watch for that as always if you like these updates please check out what we're up to fft llc.com you can look into our tree rings product which is uh 10 most interesting things um things that are grabbing our attention either they are surprising as positively negatively they make sense based on what we're seeing they don't make sense based on what we're seeing and always tying it back to different asset markets and sectors so get a lot of great feedback on that with that i'm going to sign off everybody i hope you have a wonderful holiday season merry christmas happy holidays uh and happy new year and we will see you all in 2022. take care everybody [music] you

[music] buddy luke grohmann fft hope everybody had a great weekend we had a great weekend here in cleveland uh obviously the uh the browns it looks like are gonna win we're gonna be four and one for the first time in a very long time i had a fun weekend out at the ball diamond even though my my kid did get robbed of a home run by the uh by a 20 mile an hour wind blowing in from right but what are you going to do the baseball godzilla so that's a good news we've also got a little bit of a changed background here we now in addition to mr x interviews volume one we have mr x interviews volume two so check it out if you haven't already i've gotten a lot of good reviews on it so with that we're gonna jump right into the questions here uh first off from kim finn twit in general seems to believe that gold is going to 5 000 but it will be a horrible world to live in quote unquote i i know you have the opposite view could you elaborate a bit yeah i'd be happy to um i i think it is possible there are scenarios where if we wake up one day in goals five thousand dollars per ounce that that it is possible it's there because things have gone very pear-shaped but my view is a little bit more optimistic in my opinion it it won't gold 5000 won't be terrible for the world the world won't be a terrible place to live and the reason i think that is 5 000 gold means that gold will be big enough the gold market will be big enough to be able to increasingly serve as a neutral reserve asset to settle trade globally which means that the uh the primary reserve asset of the past 49 years u.s treasury bonds will increasingly no longer be uh the primary reserve asset we've seen a little bit of this over the last 10 7 to 10 years seven years in particular in terms of gold taking share as a reserve asset from treasuries however if gold's at 5000 gold's going to take a lot more share from treasuries as primary reserve asset which means central banks aren't going to be buying as many treasuries which means the fed is going to have to buy them uh and they're gonna have to buy them with printed money and so that gets you a much weaker dollar since by virtue of the way the system worked for 50 years us has to run the biggest deficits to supply the dollars to the world so we the fed will be growing their balance sheet faster than every other central bank weakens the dollar and you get a much weaker dollar you're going to get stronger stronger global gdp is remember part of the bold case of the dollar is everyone's short dollar debt well if the dollar falls all that dollar debt gets easier to pay you're going to free up uh consumer spending around the world as the dollar the the cost of servicing dollar debt falls and this is something we saw in 2017 if you remember the dollar fell 12 percent 2017 coming into 2018 uh many strategists were uh admiring the global global coordinated growth we had in early 2018 uh and that global coordinated growth promptly stopped and reversed as soon as a dollar bottomed it began rising again so uh ultimately the the reason we think five thousand dollar gold would be positive is is gold would be gaining a lot of share from treasuries the fed would have to be buying a lot more treasuries with printed money weakening the dollar strengthening global growth and as the dollar weakens by the way you're going to have more on shoring uh of reshoring of manufacturing etc which is also a good thing for the u.s so uh that's why i say i think people would be shocked by how good the world could be with five thousand dollar gold next question iran and the yuan it came out this weekend that iran said the yuan is our primary currency now no longer the dollar to me i had several questions on it to me this is not a shocking announcement at all uh it is probably at least in no small part driven by ongoing sanctions that are going on eight years plus uh between the united states or the united states has put on iran i would argue there's a little bit of a chicken and egg question in terms of is iran moving the yuan because of the sanctions or are the sanctions on iran because they've been trying to move that you want them for years at any rate two thousand number one it's gonna be really hard for china to run out of dollars to buy iranian oil if china can buy it and you want that's important for the china's you know chinese yuan has to fall because they're to run out of dollars case um they can't run out of dollars for iranian oil anymore uh and then the second important thing is something we've harped on a lot i think it's a very important point is that if the marginal barrel of oil in the world is priced in yuan which it is and this is just further proof that it is then because as i've said before as a cfo of one of the biggest trading firms commodity trading firms in the world told me 10 years ago 15 years ago in commodities the marginal ton price is the whole the marginal ton of yuan is priced or a marginal ton of oil is priced in yuan instead of dollars then all of a sudden if the us wants the price of oil higher it's got to get the dollar down and so again this is something else that i think is an important dynamic to understand how and why that works third question from cm if biden wins and republicans hold the senate it's possible they could turn fiscally conservative and refuse to play ball on further stimulus packages how would you see this affecting the dollar the price of gold etc so the short version of it i would say is if that situation plays out which i think is possible if it plays out and stimulus is held up positive for the dollar negative for stocks negative for gold at least in the near term uh basically another scenario like we saw in march that said uh in my opinion fiscal conservativism is not is unlikely to last very long once it is pointed out to those same let's say that the uh the republicans do hold the senate and they decide to uh want to be fiscal conservatives i think they're going to want to be fiscal conservatives right up to the point where somebody points out to them that the us is either going to have to slash the defense spending to make the books to make the books balance or or to make the math work and obviously conservatives aren't going to slash defense spending number two slash entitlements uh and conservatives aren't going to slash entitlements because nobody in congress is going to slash entitlements because that's how you get uh voted out of office or number three nominally default on treasuries and conservatives aren't going to default on tracy she's not going to vote for that and why do i why are those the only two things those are the big three expenditures uh i didn't do that the big three expenditures uh those big three expenditures are now 140 of tax receipts in the united states in 2020 just that entitlements defense and interest expense and so when you look at that what you see is those are the only things they can cut that would make a difference if you don't do the stimulus covet blew the budget up full stop and so in my opinion fiscal conservativism is probably dead for years uh there may be threats of fiscal conservativism but as i said once they get sat down and said oh you want to call the pentagon and tell them you're slashing their budget or you want to tell the treasury market that you're not making the interest payment this month or you want to call tell tell 70 million baby boomer voters that that you're cutting their benefit it's not going to happen in my view so that's why i say i think any threats of fiscal conservativism from either side are to me likely to be very brief at most uh third question from mc seems like we're heading for a big shift from monetary to fiscal stimulus or fiscal policy do you think this creates the pos the potential excuse me for real growth uh and the value rotation rotation resulting from higher real rates uh so i agree we're heading for a big shift i think it's already underway in the early innings of a shift from monetary driving the boat to fiscal drive in the boat with that difference just being instead of the fed driving uh the economy it's basically u.s fiscal spending uh monetized by the fed uh i don't know that it'll drive real growth if we define real growth as uh growth in excess of inflation i don't think that that's likely to happen i think the playbook here is nominal growth and that's all you need when you've got debt to gdp at 135 percent at the federal level in the united states it's no longer about real growth it's just drive nominal growth and then the federal pin yields wherever they have to pin yields by growing their balance sheet and basically us treasury holders are going to be stuck with the bill um so we saw this in uh the aftermath of world war ii the last time u.s federal debt to gdp was this high we saw um uh nominal gdp growth ran 500 to 800 basis points above the nominal yield on 10-year u.s treasury bonds for the better part of 35 years and basically it was a long-term thank you for your donation treasury holders uh to recapitalize in the united states in that time that the gdp went from 100 plus back down to about 30 percent by 1980. um so uh in i don't the the long-winded way of saying uh i think it could bode very well for certain value names i think industrials uh would benefit from this i think they've maybe started to see a little bit of this i still think big tech works even though that's been sort of a growth slash duration trade and positive real rates i don't think is happening for a long long time um now could it happen in a very for a brief period of time uh sure uh and that's not that's gonna be an environment where you want to own dollars and basically nothing else uh but again that will positive real rates will force the united states to either slash defense slash entitlements or default on treasuries and none of those three things are happening and so the fed will in my view move heaven and earth to keep real rates negative and i for a long time and probably increasingly negative so that's that last point there and then the last question had a number of people ask me about the outlook for precious metals as well as stocks into your end and the answer here is it's intellectually offensive uh but i think it depends heavily on fiscal stimulus and i think it depends on the election outcome and if we get the stimulus i think you have to have a positive outlook on precious metals and stocks and i think if you don't uh then i think uh it basically is the beatings will continue until morale improves in other words uh you know dollar up precious metals and stocks down until uh congress can be convinced that they need that stimulus now to me i know it might be very instructive given we saw last week which is president trump said no deal at 3 54 pm and by 6 54 p.m he was tweeting out basically crying uncle i'm willing to talk i'm willing to send 1200 bucks i'm willing to do the airline deal please call me nancy pelosi uh and i think that's simply because he saw what happened to stocks he saw what happened to the dollar he saw what happened stocks i think the big one so stocks effectively are the economy now at 160 percent of gdp in terms of total equity market cap and for other reasons we've discussed before so i'm going to leave it at that uh as always check us out at fftt-llc.com for what we're up to and future appearances and if you like these updates uh please check out fftt tree rings it's a 10 most

"Bond market squeezing into stocks, gold, BTC; gold/oil ratio breaking out",2024-06-06 17:00:36+00:00,23,leQKNWwmJxs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leQKNWwmJxs,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope everybody had a great weekend i will say it was probably one of the nicest weekends of the year here in cleveland just absolutely perfect weather and to boot my cleveland browns one today making them two in one which means they are above 500 for the first time in 84 games so if we're looking for signs of the apocalypse uh or or something big happening maybe we could start there so at any rate just got back a little bit ago from throwing batting practice to my son so uh i'm good and loosened up ready to go here tonight so let's jump right in uh first question how likely are we to see an increase in monetary velocity sufficient enough to cause a meaningful jump in inflation what would what would cause that increase and when would you expect it considering unemployment is still near the 08 peak and bankruptcies are at a 10-year high to me it depends heavily if not entirely on what the fiscal side in other words what the government spends in deficits in conjunction with the monetary side what the fed does when we saw the u.s government deficits spend and basically hand money out from call it april through july and the fed effectively monetized most or all of that we saw inflation we didn't and so i think the important thing here to understand as it relates to this ongoing inflation discussion is it's a it's almost an entirely a political decision it's subject to u.s political processes but given u.s fiscal situation in my opinion we'll see more aggressive fiscal spending post-election now when i say it's almost exclusively a fiscal uh decision a political process what do i mean let's take an extreme example in theory if we can get through the political side of it let's pretend i hand out a trillion dollars a week for the next 52 weeks or 2 trillion a week let's say we hand out 2 trillion a week for the next 52 weeks so we're going to the government is going to run 2 trillion dollar deficits per week for the next 52 weeks there should be 104 trillion dollars injected into the economy over the next uh next 52 weeks i assure you we would see inflation uh the dollar wouldn't like it much and but we would see inflation and this to me i think is an important point that a lot of people are missing they're looking for inflation solely from uh monetary velocity from bank lending but you can have inflation come from currency depreciation without bank land we saw that in the 70s it was called stagflation uh the dollar falls enough and and it's given that we import as much as we do we would start to see inflation so ultimately you know crisis or not in my opinion excuse me if we have a crisis or not first that we need to get this type of spending post-election that to me is the key question at this point is what i was trying to say i'm not sure the crisis needed to spur this type of post-election spending is as big as a lot of people think though so let's jump into the next question here opinions on markets and gold and how it plays out into the election is there a potential potential deflationary bust across all assets with a biden win with the hike in capital gains tax rates in my opinion it depends you know on the fiscal side here uh do we get fiscal spending and stimulus before the election or do we not if we don't then i think we probably get a risk off if we do then i think you want to own stocks and gold i'm not sure who wins or loses matters as much as many people think um kovids pushed the u.s into a an acute fiscal crisis that really started a year ago with the repo rate spike that was when the u.s fiscal crisis went to cute and i think it became largely irrecoverable without mmt-like policies once coveted hit so i don't think the u.s government has nearly enough operating room to actually have a lot of difference between republicans and democrats in this election i know there's people talking about the capital gains tax hikes from biden i don't think that would be positive for stocks i think it could cause a risk off if he sticks by his if he wins and sticks by his guns during the lame duck period before he's in office but ultimately i would see it as a buying opportunity because i think he's going to get an office and they're going to sit him down run through the numbers and he's going to quickly realize that i think a capital gains tax that caused stocks to fall would actually lead to a lowering of tax receipts not an increase capital gains and asset price appreciation are so critical to driving us gdp u.s consumer spending that if stocks fell as a result of a capital gains tax you would likely actually see a decline in overall tax receipts uh not an increase with a capital gains tax increase so i don't think uh ultimately on the ones who if biden gets in i don't think he's going to implement that next question in light of recent events has the market properly priced in geopolitical risk as in dimitri coffinas we may be at greater risk of annihilation today like the pre the period pre-1914 the western world has become accustomed to peace and prosperity prosperity complacency combined with a revolution in technology of war making has led has laid the groundwork for the most destructive war in human history i agree the market's not pricing in geopolitical risk um i think that is partly because of a pre-1914 like attitude that the world is too interconnected to allow this to happen um and so i do think that tail risk assets or assets that would do well it's just further uh fuel you need to some gold you need some bitcoin you need some cash in your portfolio however i don't think a a global war is likely either and the reason i think that is is because the vulnerabilities of both china and the united states are so great and so immediate that were a conflict to break out like that i think it would quickly go nuclear and by that i mean the vulnerabilities the u.s would shut off china's food and oil supply the chinese would shut off the us's antibiotics and drug supply and you'd have tens of millions in each site dying probably within the first several months and so both sides will be desperate enough it'll go nuclear in my view and as a result i just don't think it's very much of an investable scenario um and so i do think you can see headlines geopolitical risk i just don't think a another world war as it were world war one world war ii is very likely so let's see here lastly here and short-term expectations on the dollar and the corollary your short-term expectations on gold and silver are you a short-term dollar bull ah i guess i guess the reason i say that is is look it's just a recognition of the machinery that's at work the us fiscal crisis has gone acute as we just described as a result of cobit and so either the us fiscal stimulus and the fed monetizes enough of it uh or they don't uh and if they don't the dollar is likely to remain bit as we've seen over the last two to three weeks in particular ultimately the dollar can't rise very far without breaking markets up to and including the treasury market and the united states is not going to let the treasury market break full stop we saw that march when the fed said that the treasury market effectively uh ceased functioning and uh we got 600 billion dollars a week in in qe so and then the dollar went from 102 to 92 in four months and so that's what i mean by they're not going to let that happen and so um ultimately have i sold any gold no have i sold any bitcoin no i'm i'm still buying gold and bitcoin uh they're still my two favorite assets even though i'm cognizant that in the short run uh the dollar technically looks good uh gold and and and bitcoin look like they're a little bit soft technically um ultimately i think the big takeaway and i'll leave you with this for tonight is we are living through the bursting of the first global sovereign debt bubble in 100 years we are living through the first changeover of a currency system in at least 50 years going back to 1971. these types of things are very difficult to trade and they're very difficult to trade on leverage dan oliver had a great chart uh earlier this year my friend at murmican capital and what he highlighted was that dur from 1914 to 1923 in the weimar republic uh the price of gold basically went to infinity and so the trade looks like borrow as much as you can buy gold and then the gold rises and pays off your debt problem was is the volatility was so great that you lost all your money four or five different times before gold went to infinity in in weimar mark terms and so my point here is is that i think you want to be unlevered and i think you want to be very careful about trying to trade a one the bursting of a 100 uh the first global sovereign debt bubble 100 years and the first currency system change in 50 years uh it's likely to be extremely difficult to do so i think you want to own the assets that are likely to win i think we've spent 50 years being asked what's what's the most levered way to play this given the bursting of the sovereign debt bubble and the change over the system i don't i think the question is no longer what's the most levered way to play this i think the question is becoming what's the best unlevered way to play this and to me that remains gold yes uh bitcoin silver and so

Foreign official asset shifts; “Silver Tsunami” thoughts,2024-05-15 17:00:10+00:00,19,DFDF5MQaEK0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFDF5MQaEK0,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope everybody is well and had a great weekend as we are getting into the middle of december here incredibly so i'm going to jump right in i appreciate everyone joining me here tonight first we are going to start with the most important question which is will the browns beat the ravens on monday night if we win we pretty much secure a playoff spot for the first time since my oldest son was a year old i think so it's been a long time uh i don't know it's gonna be a tough game uh i'm optimistic but uh we need to execute so now into the uh the economics and and all the other fun stuff first from afer most interesting thing i saw this week was the olaf schultz comment german finance minister and its ramifications do i care to expand the comment just for um for for context the comment was uh we must do everything possible to make sure the currency monopoly remains in the hands of states uh and i agree afer i think it was a very big shot across the bow of bitcoin and crypto in particular i i'm gonna preface this comment with i still like bitcoin i still have to a two to three percent position in bitcoin uh i actually just bought a little bit more bitcoin today uh that said uh look i think bitcoin is going to be regulated and i think it's going to be regulated pretty notably and uh i don't think it makes bitcoin irrelevant i don't think it makes bitcoin bad i do think that what they are talking about uh we will effectively go a long way in reducing one of the one of the bitcoin advantages that i often hear cited which is you you don't need third party trust to use bitcoin and i think that's a hundred percent right and i think the regulations are have already started to reduce that advantage and i think they will continue to do so and by that i mean know your customer anti-money laundering to come in and out of bitcoin you got to go through the banking system uh at least when i've transacted that's how it works um you have to report it on your taxes and they will find you if they don't if you don't i know that for a fact not because of me but because of a very dear friend has notified me of that my accountant has notified me of that so they are uh um i just think it's gonna be much more regulated and so i don't know that it changes that now there is a secondary question uh which was how does the system defend itself with gold in a printing press i made a comment a couple of weeks ago that the system can defend itself and and this straightforward to be to be blunt if the system decides that it wants gold to retain its primacy as the uh neutral reserve asset par excellence as someone once called it uh and not bitcoin uh they were printing press and they control fiat currency and this so they they the the system broadly speaking central banks treasury etc can say look we now value gold at you know bitcoins twenty thousand we've we value gold at twenty five thousand dollars announced thirty thousand dollars now whatever they wanna they have a printing press they can do that will they who knows that's all i'm saying is if if it's in their interest to defend their their currency monopoly um they may paradoxically uh draw gold into the defense of that currency monopoly the enemy of my enemy is my friend so to speak so all right i'm jumping on the next question from max does biden represent the dollar hegemony old order the mmt reshoring great power competition new order or is he an empty vessel waiting to be filled and we need to focus on the two sides fighting it out behind the scenes who's ahead on your card it's a great question uh the short answer is i don't know it's very early on thus far i've been surprised um in terms of the number of uh china adversarial comments out of biden and the biden administration thus far they're more than i would have expected but again he's not in office yet it's early and uh i i do think we're going to get a shift to mmt new d green new deal uh in the context of the fiscal problem no matter what as you guys know i've i'm on record uh thinking that there is um really didn't matter who won the election the fiscal order or the fiscal problem post covid was dominant to who won the election uh and to get out of that fiscal problem they need nominal gdp growth uh significantly ahead of treasury yield so let's let's watch i just don't have a strong feel strong opinion for it either way from jim doesn't it bode well very well for the equity markets that as long as the u.s keeps treasury rates below the growth rate of gdp uh there's no debt problem yes this is the short answer niall ferguson had a bloomberg op-ed this weekend quoting larry summers and jason furman joint working draft paper that they presented two weeks ago to ben bernanke ken rogoff olivier olivier blanchard uh at a combo uh brookings institution slash peterson institute zoom panel uh that the the the 64th of the the big panel or the big slide that they showed was this incredible piece of non-gaap accounting for for sovereigns which showed that as long as they kept the rate of interest on sovereign debt below the growth rate of gdp then the net present value of gdp was infinite which meant that the debt could be infinite which is mathematically true but it tells you what the game plan is uh they need to keep rates below the rates of growth uh how can they do that as long as the fed can grow the balance sheet uh enough um to keep rates wherever the fed needs to keep rates so that it's below growth they can do that uh and so they're telling us what they're gonna do rail real rates rates you know grow uh the the rate of gdp growth is going to be at a significant premium to treasury yields this is exactly the game plan they ran from 1945 1980 1945 1980 nominal gdp consistently ran at 500 to 800 basis points above 10-year treasury yields uh basically it was thank you for your donation 10-year treasury holder we appreciate your money uh and i think they're going to do the same thing and so it's very good for stocks very good for gold very good for bitcoin uh from od as someone who has followed your work closely since 2017 thank you and i believe i understand your thesis well and i'm continually amazed by your ability for correct prognosis thank you again it's very kind of you uh are you getting the same feeling that recent events are building to a climax in a word yeah i am covet pushed the fiscal situation to an unsustainable point uh it gives unprecedented political cover uh to do what you want to do we have uh uh an election where we've got people in there who seem to be willing to do those things uh you've got the vaccine coming out so now you have your cover for renormalization you've got mmt green d new deal uh being normalized in terms of policy uh you've got the fed talking about being involved in climate change which again more political cover so i don't know what the climax looks like yet but it does feel like we are building up to it so i i agree with that uh from john if gold is revalued who makes that decision is it in the usa is it the fed or treasury supposing a decision comes from the usa in consultation with the ecb bank of england is china consulted is china even warned or could china and russia attempt a revaluation without telling the usa great question my understanding is that it is u.s treasury directed by the u.s president if it was done by the u.s i would expect china to be consulted um i do not think china russia would do it unilaterally without telling the us unless the u.s took some sort of action that they deemed to be a direct act of war against them uh because i think if they did it unilaterally without consulting us it would be considered by us an act of war uh and so i just don't think that's likely to happen particularly given that it seems like a lot of things are going their way uh so i don't know that they need to do that we're building in that direction anyway towards some sort of revaluation of gold to write down the debt so they they right now they seem to be able to be patient um and so that's how i thought about that and and some of it is how it has been explained to me and then the final question id or from id to talk about where your thesis can go wrong what haven't you spent enough time thinking about uh where are your blind spots particularly when it comes to metals and printing implications so i've thought about it a lot um i used to have hair when i when i started thinking about it uh which is only half joke uh but i to to be serious the blind spots are political uh i do not have uh a you know intense deep connections into washington dc i'm watching from the outside i'm not an insider and when i say political look if the united states decides that it wants to make the decision to defend the dollar they want to send the dollar higher they come out and they slash entitlements they slash defense spending they significantly raise interest rates if the united states is willing to implement mass joblessness mass homelessness and ultimately mass starvation and death to global citizens and its own citizens via monetary policy i'll be wrong i'll be spectacularly wrong the dollar is going to go up everything else is going to go down to [music] levels that will will be extraordinarily painful i don't think politically that that's likely to happen uh i think if we look around and see events even just this year but of the past 10 years 15 years the odds of that seem very unlikely but that's that's sort of the biggest blind spot the other political blind spot is political overseas look if you get china that if china collapses uh chaotically if europe collapses chaotically or breaks up if russia collapses chaotically or has a change of leadership then again you're going to have probably a mass run to dollars for a bit but then we're right back to does the fed step in and if the fed does not and the fed decides that allowing the dollar to rise to break the entire world including the united states populous where again mass starvation mass homelessness mass joblessness if that's what they want to do they can do it anytime people say i i mean i made a comment a couple weeks ago on twitter it was half tongue and cheap it was half serious when the fed's talking about climate change i said look if the fed really wants to battle climate change take fed funds rate to 10 carbon emissions would collapse i don't know that we want to live in that world but they could battle climate change more effectively than anybody take take fed funds rates to 15 like paul volker did i assure you carbon emissions would absolutely collapse over the next year uh and stay down for probably a long time uh and so that's really the probably the biggest blind spots as i've thought about them or more the political side the political angles and then you know you can get into different uh alliances variations of that theme but i think the real big one is some sort of political decision is made where they decide to throw some big portion of the u.s and global populace into the volcano so to speak and right now i don't see that as likely but i i remain always on the lookout for signs that suggest that maybe that view has changed so with that i'm going to wrap it up for the night i appreciate

“Why is this time truly different? It isn’t.”,2024-04-24 17:00:10+00:00,27,Ds9nvNywGDI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds9nvNywGDI,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fftt hope everybody had a great weekend and a great start to your week gonna jump right into the questions here first from dm luke the west always seems to win despite having the ads stacked against them it seems that individualism and freedom are the most important factors in a nation's success is there any scenario where you see the us keeping us dollar reserve status for the next say five decades that's really my base case i think i think the u.s is going to keep global reserve currency status i think winning for the u.s is keeping global reserve currency status for the dollar while ending the u.s treasury bonds primary reserve asset status and basically ditching that for a neutral reserve asset like gold or even bitcoin that floats in all currencies if we don't do that if we don't get rid of the treasury bond as primary global reserve asset then we will lose uh and the reason that is is you will see uh what we have seen over the last 40 years uh continue which is a complete uh increasing de-industrialization of the u.s u.s defense supply chain uh a continued hollowing out of the u.s middle and working classes leading to increased uh political instability in the united states increased bifurcation of wealth uh and sort of all the negative impacts around that and so it really is a matter of national security to uh basically evolve the system back to the future and fix what was wrong with it before which is to say dollar remains global reserve currency status neutral reserve asset like gold or a bitcoin but that neutral reserve asset can't be pegged to the dollar it has to float in all currencies and so i think that's where the system is evolving to um and we'll see if it keeps evolving that direction from rd uh in the 1950s u.s or 1980s israel-style inflationary scenario like you discussed would medicare reimbursements and social security payments get debased to meaninglessness or raised greatly and offset by more money printing or somewhere in the middle i think it's somewhere in the middle i think last year's probably a pretty good example or this year excuse me we had a 5.9 cost of living adjustment for social security with eight seven eight percent cpi uh i think that's ultimately the goal i mean we saw from 1946 to 1980 we saw a nominal gdp uh consistently run 500 to 800 basis points above the interest rate on long-dated u.s treasuries so uh it's just a long more aggressive financial repression effectively from david we don't know the strike price of the jay powell pivot but what are the chances there is none and he lets the free market go i think the chances that powell lets the free market go or are very low uh bordering on zero percent the reason i say that is is if he allows that then what we will see is stocks down yields up we will see yields up because with stocks down we will see consumer spending down we will see gdp down we will see tax receipts down which means we will see treasury issuance up as uh we will see the dollar up which we will see global selling of treasuries alongside treasury alongside the fed we will be in a doom loop spiral of interest rates up asset prices down until either asset prices hit zero and the system collapses um or the us government defaults on treasuries or until jay powell steps in and so that's really we're just i don't think systemic collapse is what he is willing to allow on his watch and so we're all just sort of sitting around waiting to see where that is to be clear i think uh the fed is gonna have to relent on tightening uh by the end of three q22 which is far earlier than consensus uh from qr uh will markets break the economy or will the economy break markets uh markets effectively are the economy uh we've talked about consumer spending two-thirds of gdp net capital gains plus taxable ira distributions alone are 200 of annual growth in u.s consumer spending so if stocks aren't rising consumer spending can have a hard time rising um so it's a feedback loop dollar too high rates too high are going to trigger that doom loop feedback loop that we're that we've been seeing over the last really month and even much of the year to date from je hi luke your weekly writings are always top-notch thank you very much in a recent tree rings you mentioned that you've heard rumblings about new energy technologies even though it's far from reality what technologies are on your radar i think it's any type of revolutionary technology is really a energy technology excuse me in specific is a way out of the predicament in which we find ourselves basically a way of really improving the productivity of the us and global economy i've heard rumblings of small almost portable by truck pebble bed nuclear reactor type stuff hear rumblings that technology like that might exist or be under development um anytime i read anything about nuclear fusion i it gets my interest although i take it with a black assault but i'm not a scientist uh so it still seems pretty far off but those types of things um you know when you hear rumblings about them or see them that i think those are things that could be real game changers that i watched where they would force a real revisit of my world view from rj uh some commentary on the price action in gold would be interesting uh it's selling off a bit in a sharp market sell-off which is not it you know it's not atypical it's pretty typical uh quite frankly it's not been as much as i would have maybe feared thus far i mean we saw this in 2008 gold hit a thousand bucks an ounce in february of 08 was 700 by december um 2020 sold off sharply as well in a much more compressed time frame so ultimately i would expect gold at new highs whenever the fed is forced to relent in on tightening which as i said before continue to think is probably by the end of 3q22 um is is would be my uh current uh current estimate uh from tim do you think the russian oil for gold trade is more or less likely than when originally floated out there as an idea i think it's getting more likely because the west is getting more aggressive it seems like the situation is getting more hostile the west getting more draconian with some of the proposed energy sanctions on russia and so i think it strains credulity to think russia would just stand aside and not respond financially and this is one way that they could from justin uh curious to get your thoughts on the possibility of the 1980s soros druckenmiller strong dollar playbook being run where the fed titans policy strengthens the dollar sort of brings the world to its knees uh to paraphrase um and it raises justin i think raises a really interesting point that if if the u.s can strengthen the dollar enough that it breaks up the euro zone and basically freeze germany again to be its own standalone surplus nation that could then recycle surpluses into treasuries uh might that be a way to buy the u.s time in theory yes the challenge i think is just the mismatch between the deficits we need to finance and the size of the german surpluses are are massive there's there would still need to be some a lot of lot more uh we're still very short uh foreign creditors if that happens uh i think it also uh is a long shot simply because it would be a bet that basically the the eu would break up in a non-chaotic manner uh it would break up quickly and soon which is what the u.s needs uh in terms of increasing foreign financiers for treasury bonds and then it also assumes that in that scenario germany would immediately buy treasuries and i think most critically it assumes that the united states is not negatively impacted economically by rising rates and falling asset prices and i just think that rising rates and falling asset prices are likely going to hit the brakes on the u.s economy far faster than any uh potential breakup of the eurozone etc so uh continue to think that the soros druckenmiller playbook where the fed squeezes the dollar higher as there are as we wrote about last week washington insiders are saying that that's the plan i i think it's going to be they tried it in 2018 it failed miserably they're trying it again i think it's going to fail even more miserably even faster this time from ts in your view gold needs to be pegged to energy to fix rate or its price should be left free to fluctuate against all other assets aka free gold without the influence of paper derivatives i think the fix to the system is fixing a weight of gold to a unit of energy uh so 50 barrels per ounce of gold for example 100 barrels per ounce of gold then the price of both of those float every nation is free to make uh policy decisions uh about what works best for their country um countries that have a lot of oil can have uh can have cheap oil and cheap gold and they're gonna have a strong currency uh those that can produce a lot of oil at a high price can have expensive oil but they're gonna have expensive gold and through the gold link uh they're gonna have a weak currency um and so um that gets rid of mercantilist nations uh like uh china germany uh japan and it gets rid of mercantilist policies of nations like like china in particular but germany and japan as well uh and then it also gets rid of uh the u.s exorbitant privilege of of uh having having expensive oil and and cheap gold uh artificially overvaluing the dollar and hollowing out our manufacturing sector hurting working middle class jobs so with that i'm going to finish up for the night i want to thank everybody for joining me as always if you want

"Chinese buying gold on economic, geopolitical concerns – some secondary implications",2024-04-10 16:00:47+00:00,21,wVsbVnn26hQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVsbVnn26hQ,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everyone luke groman fftt hope everybody is well and had a great weekend uh the weather here in lovely cleveland ohio was absolutely beautiful particularly for a uh getting late march getting to be late march uh i was outside a bit today so got a little vitamin d on the uh on the old head here so hope everybody's well we're going to jump right into it here a few questions here first one is from max touch on basel 3 changes to gold holdings scheduled for june comex the last couple months golden miner action post fed even as the rates rise etc uh the so the the there's a basel iii net stable funding ratio uh nsfr for short uh is apparently it's part of basel it's apparently was scheduled to go live june 28 2021 globally uh it's apparently going live in the u.s july 1st um from what i've seen it's been delayed in the uk to january of 2022 um my reading of the of the regulations and take that with a grain of salt because i'm not a lawyer or a banker with that or a regulator but my uh my reading of it is it seems to read as if it is desirous of forcing an unwind of the massively uh levered unallocated paper gold markets because basically it it makes it very expensive for bullion banks to hold unallocated gold positions and very cheap to hold allocated physical gold positions so uh we'll see if it what happens with it uh i'm always reticent to say this is it for the gold market because i've been around the gold market now for 12 going on 13 years and i've been through a number of this zits before and so uh it's just uh uh i i want to be um conservative with that outlook uh nearer term i think you know i would say two things number one the action in gold prices where we have seen prices go down even with real yields falling a little bit and when we saw uh strong even even with strong global physical gold demand that over the last several months i think on some level was indicative of uh or something you would expect to see if if if bullion banks were trying to get on sides ahead of an nsfr change um i don't want to ascribe motive causation correlation is not causation but that's interesting more near-term and tactically what i think might be more interesting and relevant for us is if we look at what has happened to the price of gold and the price of gold miners over the last one to two weeks even as u.s nominal tenure yields have risen pretty significantly the the price of gold and gold miners have stopped going down and have actually held in pretty well on a relative on an absolute basis which is a change versus the prior couple of months so we'll see if there's some legs to it but it would seem to suggest that maybe the gold market is starting to sniff out uh the possibility of yield curve control uh from the fed in coming months or quarters uh the next question from mike g russell napier recently stated that the fed can use banks to control the money supply through banks curbing lending is this a workable way to control inflation without the need to raise interest rates to do so it sounds rather mmt-ish would this obviate the need for overt yield curve control in my opinion this makes sense uh in terms of just the mechanics of it my issue with it is that if we look at the fed's latest h.8 report which looks at u.s bank sector aggregate data what we find is this so we find total bank loans uh total bank assets total bank loans grew 0.9 in 2018 but bank loans to the u.s government bank treasury holdings and bank agency holdings grew 3.5 so about 4x the rate of growth uh of overall loans in 2019 we find total bank assets grew 4.1 percent while bank loans to the u.s government grew 14.2 percent again uh three plus uh percent uh about a three three times premium three times faster growth rate loans to the us government in 2020 we find total u.s bank or total u.s bank sector assets grew 15.1 percent while bank loans to the u.s government grew 22.3 percent again big premium and loans to the government and finally in january 21 at an annual rate for that month total u.s bank loans rose 3.3 percent while bank loans to the u.s government rose a cool 31.3 percent and so here's my point in all this and i agree with the mechanics of what the always brilliant russell napier says he's he's absolutely brilliant um and when i've been exposed to work i love his thought process with that said if we if we look at the reality of what's happening here in the u.s the us government is over 20 percent of gdp and bank loans to that sector of gdp that 20 of gdp are growing at a massive premium the total bank loans and there's likely no political will or political ability if we watch what happened throughout a lot of cities in the united states last summer uh to cut those loans so we could shift in theory they that the fed could shift um the the bank loans to the us government and and the fed could make those loans themselves effectively by upsizing qe uh but ultimately uh in the end it points to a u.s economy where the fed is losing its ability to control the money supply unless it is willing uh to to effectively choke off loans to the private sector to offset the growth in loans to the u.s government sector but in theory they could do that but if they do that that just seeds more control of total u.s money supply to the u.s government even faster than it's already happening so and we know or we we we think we know i think it's highly likely that the us government is likely going to just keep spending more and more money given the obligations they have given the the great power competition with china where defense spending looked like it looks like it's going to ramp up etc so uh that to me i think is is the issue with that where with basically and russell napier i believe has said something to this extent where basically you're starting to see this fiscal dominance where the government is basically gaining control of money supplies what i just delineated is exactly that is the government is gaining control of money supplies and there are very few governments in history that have managed money supply particularly well over time uh and then the last question from wmr have you looked at the differences today in the size of other debt markets as compared to the last time yield curve control was started size of the mortgage market corporate debt market personal debt etc if so what would you expect to happen to debt markets other than treasuries uh i think it's a great question and to me i think it's why yield curve control explicit yield curve control in particular scares the fed to death um i've not looked at in detail at the relative sizes of of the debt markets uh the last time the the us did explicit yield curve control but we do know that was 1942 to 1951. and so we do know the u.s debt markets were are in orders of magnitude uh bigger now than they were then and critically the euro dollar market as far as i know did not exist from 1942 to 51. and so this is why i think it scares the fed to death explicit yield curve control because uh yield curve control in treasuries okay they they cap those yields uh by growing their balance sheet great but all other debt markets are going to then look at that and go oh inflation might be coming currency debasement might be coming i need to sell debt you see the mortgage market sell off so mortgage spreads over treasuries would likely rise corporate spreads over treasuries junk spreads and uh the fed would likely be forced into eventually uh yield curve control in those markets as well and then the the finally the euro dollar market where you'd have these overseas dollar loans uh where the fed is setting policy but which over which they have very little direct control up you'd expect to see euro dollar market uh debt market loans also uh rise uh in terms of the spreads so yields rise and then the question becomes if that creates crises elsewhere uh ultimately uh you know that could create a stronger dollar short term but ultimately as we saw last year it's all the fed's problem when push comes to shove so uh to me it all boils down to when you say okay when you ask the question of how big are the debt markets now versus where they were the last time the the u.s did explicit yield curve control they're way bigger and the conclusion is this you could see the fed's balance sheet rise non-linearly in a very compressed period of time if this process is is managed poorly or if it just sort of gets away from them and and it might happen even if it's managed well and it doesn't get away from them so uh to me uh it continues to suggest uh you know the allocations we've long discussed gold bitcoin gold miners industrial equities uh uh uh tech equities uh things like that okay last question i i we're gonna do one more here from jerry your opinion on the status of the turkish currency what it means for the people of turkey in terms of uh the currency going forward price action i have no opinion uh what we're seeing happen tonight in fx markets to the uh to the uh the turkish lira uh makes sense it is selling off sharply given what erdogan did which was to apparently uh fire the central banker that was what was raising rates to defend the currency i think it is an important lesson here uh the problem of a central banker raising rates to defend the currency um but the actions of that slowing down the economy and creating domestic political problems for the domestic political class uh is a timeless problem and it's rearing its head again and critically turkey is not the only nation facing this problem there are many sovereigns in the same boat in terms of the outcomes for the turkish people it's likely to drive higher inflation potentially much higher inflation and so that's probably uh unfortunately not a great outcome for the turkish people so uh i would also say let's see if it drives any contagion elsewhere um uh you know it is a it is a a big move in a currency market and these are all these currency markets are all quite uh interrelated over time i don't know how big uh the the turkish uh the lira market is relative to others so we'll see we should start to see that uh go but it's just something always to pay attention so with that i'm gonna finish up for the night i hope everybody has a great week as always if you're interested in learning more about what we're up to check us out at fftt-llc.com and if you like these updates check us out

Macro views from 2 years ago I’ve been forced to rethink; US tax hike options to address deficits,2024-03-28 16:00:48+00:00,15,vMVMTk2BlyM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMVMTk2BlyM,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope everybody is well and had a great holiday weekend i guess it was more than a holiday weekend last two holiday weekends but i hope everyone had a great new year's it's 2021. so i think for me the overriding theme for 2021 is uh and i hate to be the one to say this but i think it's just something we need to be ready for prepared for is um just because the calendar rolled over i don't know that uh that that means things are immediately going to change unless we really act to change them or we we uh really take uh and and prepare ourselves for the potential things of the trends that we've been discussing for a long time and so with that i'm going to jump in here let's start off with a fun question from mary c uh hi mary how are you so many kids all over america who are seniors are having their baseball careers cut short in high school what are your son's friends doing and what are you doing to expose him to great baseball competition in this covet era to give him max exposure for college recruiting it's been an interesting thing um uh the class of 2021's really uh 2020 but to really 2021 putting a bit of a bind junior year summer of junior year after year junior is a big year for baseball recruiting and so thus far luckily my son is only a junior this year uh but a lot of his friends have had great uh mentors they've had summer team and high school coaches making a lot of calls and so it's it's happening i mean i guess i would answer the question two ways number one and i think this is apropos for a lot these days a lot of baseball college recruiting these days gets done via the iphone uh via smartphone because you can get such high quality videotape put together videos put it in front of coaches coaches the scouts they don't need to go out and look at everybody they can see the film they can break the film down in slow motion and see things um the second thing is uh what i've told them is is look ultimately if you take care of your business off the field on the field you're going to have a lot of options and if you don't take care of your business off the field on the field you won't and so uh we've just been encouraging him uh uh to take care of his business as coaches have been doing the same so with that we're gonna jump into the macro stuff uh from paul c i'm gonna go out on his question is i'm going to go out on a limb suggest that most people including myself want to know how you think gold will perform this year and especially over the next six months thanks for your content really appreciate your work thank you for reading it paul uh so in my opinion i think gold's going to do really well again the u.s fiscal situation is irrecoverable and uh barring a a few hail marys and that's really what i was alluding to when i came on here which is just because it's 2021 doesn't change the fact that u.s uh true interest expense uh which is entitlements gross interest expense and treasury payments doesn't change the fact that those are 120 percent of us federal tax receipts and so once we realize that uh doesn't matter it's 2021 it's the same issue the same issues are going to start presenting themselves in macro and so you know to me um i think gold does really well and i think bitcoin in my opinion is is a is a big positive for gold it's showing the system it it it's showing that the system has an issue and it's showing it in a way that can't it can't be masked by paper derivatives the way gold has been masked it's it's a thermometer that is not being able to be broken and it's telling you it's a temperature gauge where the pressure to mix my metaphors is rising and rising and rising and so i think it's an important sign signpost uh which uh is the uh is the price of bitcoin um ultimately um i think rising price of bitcoin uh puts the status quo which owns gold and not bitcoin in a bit of a bind they i think are coming to a point where they have to make a decision to let gold go let it rise significantly and re-capitalize the system and their own balance sheets or begin to seed increasing amounts of control of the system to those that own a lot of bitcoin and i think that statement would have been laughed at six months ago three months ago i think over what we've seen in the last three weeks uh i think fewer people are laughing now about that and so to me my view is ultimately what bitcoin's doing is a bit of a price target for gold in terms of um maybe not literally a price target but possibly but i think the system is going to have to choose let gold run given what bitcoin is doing because bitcoin is is providing a window in the into the world of what's happening in terms of the russians moved out of dollars into gold u.s citizens are now moving out of dollars into bitcoin so uh something that i think needs to be done there and i think it ultimately bodes well for gold from sean w uh chances the fed creates legal tender in 2021. i think the chance they create legal tender is extremely low however i would ask what is the difference uh between creating legal tender and between the biden administration running a four trillion dollar deficit including handing out increasing amounts of cash and then the fed financing those deficits uh by putting a quorum or a majority of those deficits on their balance sheet never to be removed from their balance sheet and in my opinion the differences are semantics barely in other words that's basically the fed creating legal tender through a marriage with treasury and so uh ultimately for our purposes technically they never they never create legal tender but i don't care it's likely to be good for gold gold miners bitcoin silver etc uh from vz if gold is brought back into the monetary system what will this mean for bitcoin uh in my opinion be very bullish for bitcoin neutral reserve asset for the people uh is how i see gold or excuse me how i see bitcoin and and gold the neutral reserve asset at the central bank and sovereign level uh from knl uh do energy commodities benefit from the currency debasement uh this cycle yes but in my opinion only once the dollar falls enough versus the euro and the yuan um one of the key points i've been talking about as it relates to multi-currency energy pricing where you've seen the marginal oil barrel priced in euros priced in yuan this means that uh multi-currency energy pricing plus the law of one price which says the same commodity cannot be priced in two different prices in two different currencies basically what that means is that if the marginal oil barrel is priced in euro priced in yuan then the dollar price of oil is likely not going to be able to rise until the dollar falls against the euro and yuan cross rate in fx markets so i don't think you're going to see energy prices really run away until the dollar falls significantly against the euro and the iran um in this cycle from jl can you see a scenario where the u.s government and banks eventually dictate the price of bitcoin as they've done with gold through cash settled derivatives i think they tried in 2017 and 2018 and you can find our tweets on that uh as bitcoin was hitting 17 18 000 back in late 17 early 18 where we specifically cited this as a risk saying that this was how they controlled the gold market interestingly one of the two bitcoin futures exchanges uh shut down in either march or april of 2019 uh and that just happened to coincide right around the bottom in bitcoin i'm not saying it caused it uh but all else equal to me the way i look at it from a very simplistic standpoint is the fewer amount of paper derivatives outstanding on bitcoin the better it is for the price of bitcoin ultimately um it's easier to buy physical bitcoin than it is to buy paper bitcoin to buy bitcoin futures and that is when you marry it with the decentralization of bitcoin relative to the centralization of physical gold where physical gold is held at centralized locations around the world is a way in which bitcoin is significantly better than gold and it makes it very hard for governments to use cash settled derivatives and unallocated paper accounts to control the price of bitcoin as they have done with gold for a long time from jim f lbma is threatening to blacklist uae gold what are your thoughts you know it's a very interesting article not least of which because we saw vietnam which just reopened its its borders to gold imports and switzerland which is obviously a global hub of the gold business uh put on the currency manipulator list for by the us which is curious in both cases however to directly answer your question i'm not sure what it means my spidey sense tingles a bit because i noticed that western agencies like the lbma are not in a big rush to blacklist any oil supplies from any middle eastern countries that they disagree with their social policies as seems to be the case here with the uae so i don't know because it makes me wonder if there's something else here a foot but i just don't know enough on it more than that to comment from darren s if we do get inflation and it runs to if it runs far or too hot how can it be controlled if yields are pinned and to me this is one of the sixty four thousand dollar questions out here this year is i and first i don't think it's going to be controlled and i think this is something a lot of the uh you know bond bowls uh i don't think they appreciate this as much as they should to me the question is less will they control it and more when will they control it if it happens because they can always control it by raising rates enough or by raising taxes uh controlling inflation but to me the when is really the key part and and the win to me is whenever there's been enough inflation with yields pinned that uh u.s debt that gdp is back to a sustainable level we're at a 135 percent of gdp now i would probably say a price target for that would be 65 to 80 percent debt to gdp is sustainable so you they would need to let it run for a while so i don't think they're going to be in a very big rush to stop inflation if it picks up and importantly inflation's one of those things where it can go little by little and all at once so caveat emptor there and then two late questions uh that i thought were really interesting from uh from knox uh max said luke wondering if a weakness of gold is that it is reserved by central banks and that gives us an incentive for the us to keep fighting the fight bitcoin on the other hand is not reserved by central banks is that the actual property that is allowing it to run what if central banks reserve bitcoin does the status change a lot of questions there um i think historically a weakness for gold is it has been that it's been reserved by central banks um i think there's been a lot of interest in keeping gold down to preserve the dollar system as structure i think there's a lot of incentive now around the world including in the us to change that system because china's been using that system against the us uh to uh to win for lack of a better word and there's uh i i think we can see that now bitcoin on the other hand is not reserved by central banks uh obviously i think that's that's true and if that changed i think that would be a huge that would be a huge change i think it would absolutely be a huge change i think the actual property that is allowing it to run is really i think it is a better reserve asset on all but two fronts um three fronts really number one liquidity but that's getting better uh obviously uh number two gold is held by central banks bitcoin isn't and in the case of the us and the us being the issuer of the global reserve currency the u.s can use gold to basically de-lever its balance sheet the fed the treasury can tell the fed to re-monetize the gold at a big number fed does so and then that money goes into the treasury general account we spend the money into the economy uh without a commensurate rise in debt uh outstanding and the u.s could in a weekend massively deliver and use gold to do that but not bitcoin and so i think that's number two where i think gold has an advantage versus bitcoin and number three and this is a little bit wonkish but and i don't think it matters in the near term however bitcoin has an ongoing energy debt in other words you have to keep consuming electricity to keep the system running whereas gold once you've got the gold coin in your hand in in the vault that's fully paid for there is not an ongoing energy debt in the same way that there is and so there would in theory i think certain interests in particular massive oil exporters uh particularly if their their oil supplies are depleting might have an interest in having um at least some of their reserves in a reserve currency with no ongoing energy debt or at least the absolute minimum ongoing energy debt which in which case gold wins versus bitcoin and that ties into your follow-up question knox which was nash equilibrium suggests there can be only one focal point as a neutral reserve asset can there actually be two in today's economy and uh i i think yes there can and i that's why is because i think energy exporters in particular uh may want to have a reserve asset that has no energy debt uh attached to it and i think culturally obviously it's been around quite a bit longer but i that's how i'm thinking about at this point but uh as you might be able to tell from some of my answers um a lot of what is happening is uh driving me to to um i wouldn't say adjust my views but just uh i'm learning i i'm learning a lot as all this transpires so uh that's it for tonight i

"Are BOJ discussions to end YCC, and thoughts on gold",2024-03-12 17:00:02+00:00,17,0oJtw_3S46U,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oJtw_3S46U,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everyone luke groman fft hope everybody's had a great weekend uh and uh uh is getting off to to a good start in the new week uh wanted to jump right into our our weekly uh update here first question is from cs is there a quantitative trigger level that the fed is looking at in order to determine that the current inflation expectations have become uh have become unanchored and would necessitate kicking off their rate tightening cycle before their employment mandate was hit it's a great question i inflation using home price appreciation instead of owner's equivalent rent uh would suggest that cpi is already running over ten percent um and in my opinion the inflation level would have to be so high that it that the average citizen on the street not only knew that the government was lying uh but about inflation but that it was high enough to actually drive a political response and even then i still think the fed would be slow on the trigger because i think they're subservient to delevering the us government balance sheet at this point so um i i i suspect the level there is a level where that happens but i think we're still a ways from there from sj what is the fed catalyst to pivot from tapering less easing to pedal down or more is it winter slash covert flare up in my opinion it's a 15 risk off in the stock market and i think accompanied by a rise in treasury yields as stocks fall would be the biggest one i do think there is uh a decline you know if if the economy got too soft uh maybe that could reverse it as well but to me given how much how critical rising asset prices are i think it really is around seeing how asset markets respond to what they're doing from bd so it appears taper will begin in november december with permanent reverse repo and the fima swaps what will be the market reaction i would assume negative initially until they realize inflation still runs and liquidity is still flush then a resumption of asset rallies i'm not sure uh in in in my opinion the most likely reaction particularly if they have the standing repo facility in place with those other facilities is is no reaction uh because ultimately they'll be if that's the case uh there's no reduction of liquidity um in effect dollar liquidity will still be increasing taper will be happening but it'll be still increasing liquidity um if there is insufficient alternative liquidity um you know in terms of those alternative channels in place at the time of taper then i do think you could have a brief risk off from lf is there still a plan technology with low interest rates or do you see bigger opportunities with industrial commodities i still think that real rates in the u.s have to get to negative 10 negative 15 or more uh i still think tech does well in those uh in that setup i just think in view of the inflation um uh that has been that has become i think higher conviction uh i think the opportunities with industrials and with in particular energy commodities electric vehicle related commodities uh are just better that's all uh from than big tech at this point from bf how do you foresee the idea of stack flash incoming stagflation coming versus hyperinflation can it be stagflation first then hyperinflation also what do you make of the idea that the u.s government has demonetized gold in my opinion a currency destroying hyperinflation in the u.s is very unlikely because at a high enough price the u.s can produce virtually everything it needs uh if you look at these countries that had currency destroying hyperinflations they tended to be smaller countries and couldn't produce uh what they needed uh at any price um hence the currency destroying hyperinflation i do think bitcoin could hyperinflate versus the dollar which is in my opinion what uh jack was referring to this weekend it is important to note that israel had a modest hyperinflation if you will inflation peaked at 400 percent per year uh in the early 80s for a brief time as a way of reforming pensions delevering the sovereign balance sheet etc um to me stagflation seems to most be the most likely outcome but with a few things going wrong i think you could see a a quote unquote modest hyperinflation a la israel in the early 80s in the u.s if you interrupt supply chains for a long enough time and continue monetary stimulus for a long enough time um i agree that the us the government has demonetized gold you can see it de facto has happened over the last 40 years will it be remonetized there are foreign central banks that look to be trying to move gold back into the system as a reserve asset that's how i would define it but it has been removed from the monetary system as a reserve asset uh up until uh just recently uh so i think de facto that has happened uh from ka share structure of the bitcoin etf bito can bito wag the bitcoin dog uh the crypto exchanges stay unregulated so institutions won't touch physical bitcoin finra allows ira money into bt bito and it's sipc protected bito increases shares instead of allowing share price to increase thus horizontal sterilizing fund flows throwing a few well-timed exchange hacks to push people into insured bito i think it's possible i think we need to be cognizant of it i've just started reading the bit of prospectus it's cash settled futures uh and so that certainly raises that potential issue ultimately though i think the the the decentralized nature of bitcoin and importantly the fact that it's way easier to buy bitcoin on coinbase than it is to set up a brokerage account and be and by bito through the etf um and then perhaps most importantly the ease of taking delivery of physical bitcoin if you will uh during any potential futures sell-offs i think it makes it a very different animal at this point than gld so um let's watch and see but i'm not that concerned about it at this at this point uh mechanics of a gold revaluation had a number of people ask about that um the mechanics are pretty straightforward they're detailed in the federal reserve accounting manual as it was updated in july of 2021 uh treasury instructs fed to buy gold at a price as fed buys gold at that price with printed money uh the treasury's gold is revalued higher uh that revaluation amount gets deposited into the treasury general account or tga and treasury has total discretion over how it wants to spend that tga if it spends that tga into the economy on different projects without a commensurate rise in debt that will significantly increase u s g d p probably primarily through a nominal increase with very high rates of inflation but ultimately that would then allow gdp to rise a lot and were that to happen you would de-lever the us government's balance sheet that the gdp would go from 125 percent to 70 or something and at that point the fed could begin to normalize rates so i think that is uh that that's the mechanics of how you would do it and it would work uh from mh doesn't a gold revaluation significantly benefit our adversaries who increasingly hold gold uh it depends on who you think are our adversaries it's complicated high gold prices gold's a neutral neutral reserve asset so a neutral reserve asset a high priced big in terms of market cap neutral reserve asset is bad for certain elements of washington d.c and bad for certain elements of wall street it's very good for main street america it's very good for the u.s military it's very good for the rebuilding of u.s defense and industrial infrastructure that have been completely hollowed out by the strong dollar mantra of the last 40 years right now the u.s military and a lot of critical components is dependent on china to source the us military and you have to ask yourself if a china is an adversary would an adversary supply the united states with defense goods in a war against that adversary and the answer of course is no high gold prices certainly agree would be good for russia and china in terms of their mark to market profits on gold and in terms of changing the system away from the dollar system but the dollar system of the last 20 years nobody's loved it more than china who's won more than china under the dollar system of the last 20 years nobody washington dc wall street china love the dollar system as it's been structured so if you change the dollar system i don't think china's necessarily going to love it so that's why i say it's complicated so to me bottom line on net gold revaluation benefits adversaries tactically from a mark to market trading standpoint in fx reserve balances uh but it doesn't benefit our adversary strategically uh bitcoin could be used in this way as well but ultimately a revaluation of a neutral reserve asset much higher means the united states is going to start rebuilding its own defense its own industrial base uh and that is really good for the united states strategically really bad for our adversaries strategically um and so uh you know we'll we'll see from there so uh great questions as always uh if you're interested in what we're up to you like these updates check us out at fftt dash llc.com uh follow us on youtube as

Rising global concern on US debt/GDP – can there be enough UST demand at higher rates?,2024-02-22 18:00:23+00:00,16,s0WBfv9otGo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0WBfv9otGo,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope everybody had a great weekend i am going to jump right in here a bunch of great questions so thanks to everyone as usual first question i spent a lot of time with this one because i think it touched on a number of uh questions actually people asked and i think it's important to frame um i i think how to think about things or one way to think about things it's not the only way to think about things but i think it helps frame some of the big gears that i think we need to be thinking about as investors and the question is from kim lee it says what is a balanced portfolio in 2022 stocks growth in value bonds including treasuries long and short term cash dollars and other fiat precious metals other commodities real estate it also ties into a question from astro about how to conduct construct a portfolio excuse me for the average 65 year old boomer and so i think you need to start with the setup where we are like i just mentioned which is to say it's historically unique we've got the first bursting global sovereign debt bubble in a hundred years and we have peak cheap energy and so you what that ultimately means is mankind is attempting to move off of a higher energy return on invested energy or ero ie higher eroi energy source to a lower eroie energy source first time in recorded history and so you'll frequently hear some people say well the stone age didn't end for lack of stones which is correct they moved to the bronze age because bronze was better than stone we're trying to move from fossil fuels to energy that right now is actually less efficient and that's a huge that's a huge deal energy is the master resource energy is nature's discount rate effectively uh and so a lower eroie means structurally higher energy costs and that's a problem on two fronts one it sends inflation structurally higher uh and two it makes because it's nature's nature's discount rate you're basically raising the hurdle rate um whether central bankers do it or not for all sorts of projects and assets and that makes a lot of debt on economic over time and given debt levels runs the risk of basically a debt deflationary spiral and so that leads you to one of two options really from a policy standpoint uh unless they're able to find some sort of a massively better energy source and commercialize it very soon those two options are default or restructuring of the debt sovereign debt as well as a lot of other corporate muni etc along with obligations or central banks have to print money and more fully reserve the the debt that's outstanding which is to say they grow their balance sheets to buy debt to keep it from defaulting and the release valve or fiat currencies globally and we saw this in 2021 uh 2020 to 2021 uh the inflation side and in the last five six months we've seen what happens uh when they just stop doing that let alone start trying to sell debt back into the market they being central banks so ultimately they have to inflate uh sovereign debt underpins the currencies the sovereign debt uh with the system as structured also represents collateral for a lot of a very very highly leveraged system derivatives etc and so that debt is allowed to nominally default the entire system collapses the backing of the currencies gets very weird and so simply put default restructuring of sovereign debt is not a policy option in the end so they have to inflate um but they're trying to sort us inflate as a way of slowly restructuring the system on the fly basically sort of trying to change the tires on the car while the tires on the hot while the cars on the highway excuse me and or as we've put it trying to ride two horses with one ass and so they need to consistently print more over time to more fully reserve the debt for as long as peak cheap energy continues to drive the marginal cost of an oil and energy fossil fuel barrel a fossil fuel calorie if you will uh higher but they don't want to print so much so fast so that they lose control of inflation on the upside and then they have to institute yield curve control across much of the bond market which is effectively just an all at once rapid restructuring of the debt um and that would be extraordinarily inflationary and so to me ultimately peak cheap energy is a is a real world constraint that they can't print around and that's putting uh constant upward pressure on commodity prices and therefore inflation and debt levels are another constraint uh both on if inflation gets too high and if inflation gets too low risking the debt deflation death spiral and so this space of debt of of inflation too high inflation too low that sort of goldilocks area is shrinking over time as energy prices rise and as debt levels rise um and eventually that goldilocks space is going to go to zero unless this new energy solution is found and rapidly commercialized and rolled out and so when we think about it this way let's bring it back to asset allocation to me asset allocation in the current environment is really about understanding both the end game where they're gonna have to print it uh and then the optionality and the path uh optionality of the path uh and where one is based on those two things based where one is in one's lifespan and one's investment goals and so ultimately i think the the real value uh um i i think the real value of debt in things you need in other words the purchasing power of bonds over the course of this cycle is likely to fall sharply so you get i think you need to be overweight things you need over the course of the cycle commodities real estate equities exposed to commodities and industrials and then i think things that do well when central banks more fully reserve debt gold bitcoin um i think you want to be underweight bonds which over the course of the cycle will likely lose significant value in real terms as we just talked about but anytime they don't print enough you're going to likely see debt outperform these other asset classes for a bet at least until the deflation involved begins to call into question the very solvency of of sovereigns and western sovereigns in particular along with corporates muni's etc because again they're they're levered and they need rising inflation and rising asset prices particularly in the u.s to stay solvent to be able to basically make the interest payment fully broadly defined our true interest expense definition of interest plus entitlement payments and so for me what this asset allocation looks like through this historically unique time is a heavy cash allocation overweight industrial equities overweight commodities especially energy underweight debt long attractive residential real estate and vacation property stuff that is i think unique uh or has a a finite value lake houses ocean houses things you can rent cash flow etc i think you want to be long gold and gold miners i think you want to be long bitcoin i think farm land which has obviously done well i think likely continues to do well ag is i think it's just a derivative of energy uh and so the netapp is i think when we think about asset allocation i think that the next third 20 to 30 years are going to look very very different than the last 30 to 40 years especially when you start throwing the possibility slash likelihood of deglobalization into this mix uh d if globalization was disinflationary or deflationary uh it's strange credulity to think that deglobalization isn't going to be inflationary uh and so i would be very careful about trying to trade the end of a 50-year currency system first bursting global sovereign debt bubble in 100 years the first ever human shift from a higher energy return on invested energy energy source to a lower eroi source and do and deglobalization when you combine all of these things i think trying to trade what is happening is likely to be a fool's errand unfortunately and i think this chart we've showed before of what gold did in weimar germany is a perfect example uh yes gold in german rex marks went from basically one to a trillion over five years but if you were levered you lost all your money four or five different times uh the volatility was just face peeling and so i think it's important to stay low over your skis the asset allocations we talked about before is i think again adjusted for um adjusted for life span uh where you are your investment goals are are how i'm thinking about things at the moment my next question tom luke what strategy do you give the average middle-class person in the given environment kind of ties on to the first point i think in addition to the the points made before for about asset allocation and what a unique environment this is i think entrepreneurship wins over the course of this cycle i think the internet levels the playing field uh particularly in content related businesses versus bigger corporate competitors and i think you find a niche and you exploit it to the best of your abilities um alternatively there's a lot of boomers retiring i've heard probably three or four different times in the last year uh baby boomers that want to retire they own a business they would love to sell it they can't find a buyer for their business uh and so i think if i wasn't doing this i'd be i'd be tempted to raise money or deploy my own capital making a deal with a baby boomer to buy their business from them pay them a retainer for a year to act as a consultant teach me the business and then expand after they retire and boom you have your own business there's i just think a lot of businesses are sort of small mid-size they're too small to be uh getting bit up by private equity and there's a lot of boomers looking to cash out um not as many people look at the buying and so i think that that's a potential opportunity as well when you think about entrepreneurship over the next five to ten years next question is from fm hi luke question is probably overdone to death but do you see a global recession as a foregone conclusion eu asia how about the u.s uh in the eu yes uh i think the ads of a recession they are extraordinarily high they have gone about effectively attempting to commit economic suicide vis-a-vis what they've done with energy asia is a maybe a very possible recession um and and if the eu just keeps doing what they're doing um if the fed does not reverse course and begin growing their balance sheet again i i think the u.s will be in a recession on a lag just given my career i remember in late 90s when uh asia pac was five percent of sales ten percent of sales for u.s industrial companies and so when the thai bot got devalued it wasn't going to be a big deal the asian crisis was not a big deal for us industrials nine months later u.s industrials were in a recession uh and that's when that the gdp was lower debt levels and the system were lower asia was way smaller uh the system was less interconnected and so to me i think it's highly likely the eu has a recession if the eu is a recession it unless the fed reverses course it's only a matter of time till the us has one it's just there's so much leverage eu is huge as a trading partner um it's it's i think it's fair to complete unless unless the fed reverses course um and i as as you guys know we think they're going to stop tightening no later than the end of 3q 22. will that be early enough i don't i i i don't know unless they renew qe it might not be jp can you explain how how the ruble and russian oil and gas are interrelated sure effectively i've used oil and gas to create a short squeeze in the ruble there's very little float in the ruble and there's a heck of a lot of demand for oil and gas i mean the europeans are importing 150 billion dollars a year of russian oil and gas and russia is saying hey only rubles and yes there's a conversion process they have to go to gas from bank and uh change them into rubles but ultimately that puts the value of the ruble completely at the control of the russian central bank is is gas trump going out and buying rubles in the open market are they are they getting them from the central bank who are creating them uh at the end of the day depending on how that goes russian central bank has control of the ruble not the u.s as the us had hoped with sanctions from chris could the u.s mandate uh u.s stable coins to be backed by treasuries to give the stables the all clear to be used in u.s transactions could the new buyer of treasuries could be the new buyer of treasuries the us government desperately needs uh it's a great question a couple people asked that um in the thread today so i i appreciate you guys uh highlighting that on the legal side i don't know if the u.s can mandate that i suspect they can but that's just not my belly wick i would defer to someone who would know the legalese if you will of that uh however if they can then yes in my opinion it would basically would be akin to the money market fund reforms or mmf reforms that the uh us implemented in 2014 it was past 2015 16 they went into effect but what those basically did was force the multi-trillion dollar money market fund industry in the u.s uh they they they didn't have to buy treasuries let me i don't want to misspeak they were treasuries were given favorable treatment for regulators relative to gating in stress times of stress and i think maybe even relative to capital or bailouts but i know definitely as it related to gating and so the point was they didn't make the money market fund uh industry by treasuries but they they they definitely encouraged them via regulation and they responded you saw a massive increase in treasury funds treasury money market funds and who was the loser here was you can go back and find articles in the journal and elsewhere at the time that um the cost of capital in money market funds in dollar money market funds around the world went up libor went up the u.s government basically crowded out global money market funds and so i think this would be something similar structurally if i'm understanding it properly um and uh effectively be tapping the global crypto buying pool capital pool for treasuries which i think it would be brilliant it would it would absolutely i think uh drive more uh capital into treasuries uh short term in particular um however it would also undermine other bond markets around the world to the extent that we continue to have this inflation there's gonna be money out of bonds into crypto on the margin um then u.s treasury's still getting their cut at least in short-term paper uh but the rest of the world rest of the global dollar bond markets will be borrowing more uh and that ultimately means either you have a crisis or you have a uh central bank's uh getting more liquid to fight that crisis which is going to encourage more money into crypto which is it'll it be turns into a virtuous cycle for crypto and short-term treasuries uh and it ends up choking off capital from uh competing dollar borrowers like we saw in the money market fund example in 2015 and 2016. so with that i'm going to wrap up for today i appreciate as always you joining me uh if you want more information about what we're up to check us out fftt-llc.com you

How the chance of outright deflation informs our macro view,2024-02-07 17:00:45+00:00,14,qShjgtPcdJg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qShjgtPcdJg,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fftt hope you're well and had a great weekend a lot of stuff going on so in the interest of your time and and trying to cover as much as we can i'm going to jump right in so first question is from np what are the realistic off-ramps here luke for both sides russia faces financial ruin west faces extreme commodity shortages and supply disruptions taking away mutual armageddon is there a path forward here for all parties uh i don't know um maybe some sort it's it's maybe a ceasefire some sort of political resolution acceptable to both you know neutrality uh declaration and russia pulls back uh i don't know on the political side what i what i do feel increasingly strongly about is that we're quickly reaching the point uh where we are past the point of no return for global markets where supply chains uh commodities uh growing season in ukraine and russia collapse in russia contagion recession in the u.s europe and the world um all of these things i think if we're not already past sort of the point of return on those things i think we're very close and so to me it's it's it's just not a good setup for risk assets broadly uh even with markets doing what they're doing so far um until you get great clarity on this to me uh i think gold dollars bitcoin are about all you can all to me they're the things i feel most comfortable with uh second question from gv uh now that one russia's financial options are limited to using gold one way or another and two that china sees its us dollar accounts are exposed and may try to sell treasuries how does the dollar funding market and commodities evolve ahead especially if taiwan comes in to play another questions uh somewhat in the same vein from edwin daniel if i understand you this clip represents your complete your conclusions about what happened last wednesday night by the way i love your newsletter recommend you to all my friends i love the non-political honest and brilliant analysis thank you edwin to me the us and eu sanctioning russian fx reserves might be remembered in time as every bit as important an event as nixon closing the gold window two saturdays ago the united states closed the fx reserve window now some people are still pushing back that well it'll only be bad actors that get this treatment what they are missing and i think this is very important to understand is the list of countries in the world that the united states has never considered a bad actor over the last 80 years is exceedingly short so uh i'd increasingly expect fx reserves and in the future commodity related surpluses to bid for physical gold and the important thing there is as we wrote about tree rings last week fx reserves current fx reserves are uh roughly 20 times the size of the annual physical uh product annual physical gold production uh commodities are another 12 well the oil market alone is another 12 to 15 times uh global uh physical gold production annually then you layer more commodities on tablet what you quickly see is you have an epic mismatch uh arguably of fx reserves and commodities bidding for physical gold as a result of what was announced last week so let's see how it plays out i don't know how it plays into the dollar funding markets i think what we've seen i guess if i a gun to my head if you look what the fed has been busy setting up over the last two years they look a lot like the fed setting up facilities to ensure that dollar funding markets will remain very well supplied standing repo facility uh swap lines etc so i don't think the problem will show up in dollar funding markets per se nor in the us banking system i think it's a sovereign balance sheet issue um and and we're seeing that in real time as the west doesn't have a lot of options policy options vis-a-vis russia if any of those policy options cause a recession in the west because that starts to cause problems with the the sovereign balance sheet okay next question from mary chapman hey mary uh hi luke my question is to what extent will higher uh and higher gasoline prices impact consumer spending and add to consumer credit cards what's the warning sign that credit's about to freeze up uh in my opinion the key thing i'm watching is uh total u.s consumption is a percent of gdp uh as of about four to six weeks ago uh that number was just below three percent which historically over the last 50 or so years has been the the percentage that uh begins to um foreshadow a recession uh with the move we've had in oil over the last two weeks we are now well above that percentage of u.s oil consumption as a percent of gdp so i i think a recession is likely coming probably it starts in the eu if they're not there already followed shortly thereafter by the us i don't think the banking system um is is at risk uh like it was in 2008 i think the issue like i was saying is more on the sovereign debt side there is so little attention being paid to western sovereign balance sheets because for 50 years they just haven't mattered underneath all of the noise and the rhetoric about this crisis what is being whispered uh quietly now but it will be increasingly loud in coming days and weeks is in my opinion sovereign balance sheets matter the us's options are limited because its sovereign balance sheet is such a dumpster fire it's in the worst shape in 150 years the eu's options strategically are very limited because it's sovereign balance sheet is a dumpster fire so i think you know and when we say if the problems at the sovereign level this time what does that look like well that looks like the central bank's printing into an inflation spike so i think that's what we're going to see so what do we do i think you still like i said the things i feel best about owning at the moment given what i know gold dollars bitcoin after that the list might my levels of comfort fall sharply until we get some sort of political clarity uh on some sort of de-escalation uh from paul m how can china hedge their three trillion dollars uh fx reserves um if they don't will the fed monetize all of it and i guess move moving on to their balance sheet mechanically that's what they could or would do i don't think china's gonna sell it because as a practical matter china's gotten rid of it on a net basis a long time ago if you look what china's done over the last 10 to 15 years particularly after 2008 when the u.s showed its hand that it would print whatever needed in crisis uh the the the chinese have been busy uh effectively uh borrowing money and and spending it on finite hard assets around the world ports oil fields uh uh refineries gold gold mines so on so forth if you're long three trillion dollars of us dollar fx reserves and you are borrowed three trillion or more against hard assets on the other side you've sort of net yourself out you've already effectively sold those treasuries without ever selling those treasuries i think that's really what has been done next question is from dc hi luke the absence of the pivot to china and the china trade wars from the news flow would suggest the us administration is having problems keeping all the plates spinning and is being distracted from the main game thoughts [music] yes i i think right now they are putting out the fire of trying to overcome energy shortfalls in the very short run um in an election year uh that's obviously being caused by russian self-sanctions uh in the western in the western hemisphere um so it seems like they are being preoccupied by that um i do suspect that if it hasn't happened already there will soon be a realization a dawning realization in washington dc uh that separating the us from china is going to be a lot more painful and a lot more inflationary than a lot of people in washington would have asserted just two three weeks ago um i i do think they're still aware of the main game uh which is to say um moving away from china and and reassuring but i think there's a growing realization that it's not gonna be as easy as they thought uh from zp based on your understanding of macro and everything as a young american should i plan on staying in america for the next 50 years or so would it be better to make plans and eventually move somewhere else in my opinion america is going to be the best place to be for the next 50 years and arguably beyond i would say in particular areas of america that are long energy food water uh fresh water um yeah we're seeing energy shortages now what that looks like um water remains an issue globally um and so in addition there's as it happens places in the u.s that have a lot of energy food and water um also have relatively low-cost housing low-cost education high quality education for your kids so between that the rules of law um uh numerous other advantages for me i think places like the midwestern and southeastern us uh are likely to be amongst the best places to be in the whole world over the next 10 15 20 50 years from pm how can powell raise more than once or twice without inverting the yield curve and if he does that is a recession guaranteed going from memory inversion is not necessarily a guarantee of an immediate recession however it's been an exceedingly accurate indicator of an eventual recession historically um i at the moment i think the fed will still try to raise once if only for token just to prove that they could do it maybe they do twice i'd be surprised but ultimately continue to believe that the fed is going to have to print money into an inflation spike sooner than expected and what has transpired over the last two weeks in my opinion pulls forward that sooner than expected date so we'll have to keep an eye on that there was an article about treasury market illiquidity this afternoon on bloomberg i think that's a very important notif uh uh indicator we've repeatedly said over the last several years that the fed's shadow third mandate has been treasury market functioning in other words make sure the treasury market is working well so continue to think that's the case um so uh bottom line maybe a rate hike maybe two but i continue to think the date of the fed having to print money into an inflation hike is not only sooner than expected my sooner than expected is being pulled forward by events and then finally from mb how would you allocate if you were retiring in three months and all you had was a self-directed ira currently valued at 25 years of purchasing power that's a great question uh if it was me i would do 25 cash in dollars i would do 20 gold in one ounce gold phys gold coins american eagles or maple leafs i would do probably 15 percent in commodity and industrial related equities slanted toward the united states i would do 25 percent in what i would call u.s consumer cartels procter gamble coca-cola clorox philip morris starbucks things that are relatively not that expensively valued they're sort of bond proxies with an inflation hedge that either have pricing power due to their market share or pricing power due to their addictive nature uh in the case of philip morris and i would argue starbucks as well at least for me uh i would put 13 percent into nasdaq uh stocks or into a nasdaq index since it's mostly big cap tech anyway and then i would take the last two percent and i would put it in bitcoin and so with that i'm going to finish for today i wanted to thank everybody for joining me as usual uh if you enjoyed these updates check us out

"If US avoids a recession, are equities attractive?",2024-01-23 17:00:49+00:00,16,vp6VHF5SxEg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp6VHF5SxEg,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] thank you all very much for joining me uh this is a uh mailing list fftt mailing list only special event we didn't let anyone else know we're doing this it's an exclusive so thanks for signing in thanks for joining us run through questions here for the next 45 minutes as many as i can and so i'm gonna jump in here starting with a question from lee could you explain your dollar gold devaluation idea in a little more detail please wouldn't the us government have to buy all gold below the higher new amount to keep up the new price if necessary uh the short answer is yes they would have to probably make that market on an ongoing basis but to explain it in a little bit more detail the us government's debt the gdp is called 130 percent the problem once it gets that high is if they really want to raise rates uh significantly for any reason uh say for example they want to control bitcoin or they want to restrain inflation etc the problem is that significantly raising rates will put the u.s fiscal situation in a very difficult position right away because the debt the gdp is so high and so step one and whether it's now whether it's down the road step one has to be delivering the balance sheet at some point so that raising rates doesn't hurt the u.s fiscal situation much more than it slows down the economy create more problems than it solves so a one way of doing this would be if the fed uh was told by treasury bid for gold roughly every four thousand dollars in gold is about a trillion dollars the mechanics of this per the fed operating manual fed bank uh federal reserve bank's operating manual is that if the if the fed was told to do this by treasury it would result in an uh account or a and a deposit in the treasury general account with the fed or the tga so every four thousand bucks is a trillion roughly in the tga say we use 40 000 for round math that's 10 trillion dollars into the tga which the treasury could then spend into the economy assuming that they do something relatively smart with it infrastructure etc there would be in theory some measure of ongoing multiplicative uh effect to that uh it would boost gdp immensely and so then you would be de-levering the economy your debt the gdp ratio would go down as your gdp went up uh uh and in theory again if it's infrastructure stuff with a longer tail there would be a multiplier an ongoing effect that would then get dd debt to gdp down to a level where the fed could raise rates significantly without bankrupting the us government in effect so that's how i've thought about that to as i said they would probably have to buy a gold in an ongoing basis to keep that market uh where uh where they want that market to be which again would be more liquidity next question uh from eric what is the possible influence of basel iii accords on banking on mon i don't know what just happened here okay uh it's just skipped on me here so we'll go back to that other one uh thanks for hosting another q a a question i have for you was on what were your thoughts on grant williams interview with paul singer a great interview what about his thoughts about the fed being completely clueless um a lot of you are our investment thesis ties around policy makers being in the know any thoughts on them just being so out of touch and tied up in the system there's no plan we could spoil out of control quickly so i have printed out but have not read the transcript from paul singer and grant williams yet i don't think they are clueless i think particularly at the highest levels uh when you get to the fed chair fed vice chair i think they are very tied in i think the challenge is that they're effectively uh they cannot go speak out of turn with the politicians uh and so the politicians that that makes them buy uh transitive property effectively politicians and so i think they have to sound clueless i think at the lower fed levels uh i think they in turn can't speak out of out of turn with the higher fed officials uh but for example uh harold malmgren on twitter we had a conversation uh last year late last year where i mentioned stan fisher and harold who's been in washington for 60 years very tight in said that stan fisher is one of the ultimate behind the scenes players in the world so i was fed vice chairman uh for a number of years under obama in the early years of the trump administration so i don't think they're clueless i do think that does not preclude the system from spiraling out of control quickly but that's how i would answer that okay so let me see here um can you comment on the article about tether being used by the cpcp as a pump and later dump web bitcoin as a weapon against the dollar system i i i thought that nick carter did an excellent job highlighting the lack of visibility in tether and that that is a problem um i i think that ccp using it as a pump and dump i i i know we know that roughly 60 65 of bitcoin are mined in china we know that uh we know that apparently in the offshore exchanges uh tether is used a lot more um to me i just i i think tether is where where i've come to untether is i think it's a near-term risk in the price for bitcoin potentially where if something if if there is a a blow up there um it could cause a problem in the short run for bitcoin's price with that said i would be a buyer on that because when you look at the domestic exchanges to me i think maybe the cleanest way to play if you really have a concern about tether is you buy a coinbase on the ipo because to me all the tether concern uh coinbase doesn't use tether and and um it would seem like coinbase would gain enormous share if anything happened or tether was uh was regulated so um let's uh that that's how i've kind of thought of that let me move to our next question here we answered that one okay from eric what is the possible influence let me start answering there we go what is the possible influence of basel iii accords on banking on monetary situation this year will the banking tier one regulation have an effect on the markets currencies trade commodities and precious metals is it might sound like conspiracy theory but is it a part of the endgame solution um to me what i've read so far of this net stable funding ratio as it relates to uh basically a separation of unallocated gold versus allocated gold in how they are treated it seems like it has the potential uh to give preferential treatment to physical gold over unallocated paper gold you've seen the lbma squawking about it you've seen uh that the fed was meeting with the lbma about this three years ago which to me was very odd given uh the consensus is that gold is irrelevant the fed doesn't care about gold it's unclear to me why they would be meeting with the lbma about this three years ago unless it did matter um so i i have not done enough research i haven't been able to get my arms around enough what it means other than there seems to be a clear delineation between paper and physical that has the potential to be really good for gold prices but i just don't know enough to say that this is it this is a reset etc what catalyst do you think gold is looking for to resume uptrend seems like real rates continue to push it down um you know i for me it really is all about real rates in the short run uh and then in the bigger picture it continues to be about uh the us fiscal picture and the u.s fictional fiscal picture needing uh increasingly negative real rates to basically keep the wheels on the cart because the debt is so high because the deficits are so high because the fiscal picture was uh positioned was so damaged by coven uh and because the entitlements are going cash flow uh negative uh etc so for me i'm really in the short run watching negative real rates which are they've pulled off their lows um but they're still you know comfortably negative there seems to be this consensus that they're going to be moving higher and that um the the reflation trade and so i think part of it is uh whether or not this how the reflation trade and how that goes i think if you get another turn down you get another turn down in real rates um then um as the fed is forced to come in and stimulate more then i think you get another leg up i think if the fed is as we think they will be uh forced to resume yield curve control later this year or not resume but uh implement explicit yield curve control um later this year that i think is really the sort of turbocharged uh catalyst for gold that we're looking for but for the moment it doesn't seem like they're going to need to do that and so all else equal yeah i think it probably just continues to sort of uh hang out where it where it's been hanging out from hussein does biden's order on new gas leases most likely result in higher oil prices or or do anything to prolong the life of the petrol dollar said differently does it change uh your idea on oil trades settled in gold uh to me when i think about the flows of it anything that causes us us to be in the u.s to produce less oil it increases our dependence on foreign oil all else equal which means we import more oil we export more dollars all else equal that's negative for the dollar and and should result in higher oil prices uh in terms of trade changing uh my idea on oil trade settled in gold the answer is no ultimately that's par with oil settled in gold is part and parcel to multi-currency energy trading which if we look last week the european union released a draft saying they want to continue moving toward more oil pricing in euros it would seem like russia would be more than willing to do so uh and in fact actually already is uh pricing in euros and so once you have oil priced in dollars and then marginal barrels of oil priced in euro and yuan as is the case uh basically what's happening there is not that oil is settling in in in gold directly barrel for barrel but ultimately in the case of euro oil in the case of yuan oil it's effectively settling in european and chinese goods these these areas run goods surpluses they they uh so they make more than they consume more than they import with the exception of of energy and and other commodities and so to the extent there is a uh a a a surplus left over of euros uh in places like russia and elsewhere uh and they want to deploy those into a reserve asset uh to me it looks like that reserve asset at least one of them would be gold and that's ultimately how that fits in so the short answer is is i think higher oil prices weaker dollar all else equal how would you look at the price of gold today versus the bottom in 99 even though it's gone up 6x uh relative to the debt is it still valued similarly any comments on the gold oil ratio are appreciated as well from mike yeah if you look at where uh foreign held treasuries as a percentage of the market value of u.s uh official gold we are marginally higher than we were in 99 2000 so it's probably six seven percent of foreign held treasuries outstanding relative who uh it's been off you know a month or so since i looked at the chart but i want to say it's probably four percent five percent uh at the bottom in 99 or 2000. so you're still talking about gold collateralizing u.s federal debt outstanding the foreign held portion of it at a pretty similar rate and for pretty much most of history prior to 1989 that that ratio that's seven percent today was 20 to 130 in in 1980 so still think there's a lot of upside there gold the oil ratio to me is really a function of the ongoing uh penetration or development of the multi-currency energy market which per my last comment seems to still be developing both in china as well as in europe so i'd expect the gold oil ratio to continue rising all else equal for as long as that happens can you explain the mechanics of how treasury's coming due can cause a crisis in the repo market when the treasury's come due the government has to cash the holders so why does this cause problems for the banks why can't they just print it my understanding is a significant portion of treasuries will roll over this year so when we to go back i'll i'll use the last the repo rate spike i wanted to say last year but we're moving fast it was actually a year and a half ago so september 2019 we had the repo rate spike and the issue there was multi-faceted but ultimately it was a combination of uh too much issuance of treasuries at the short end a lack of sufficient foreign buying due to fx hedge treasury yields being negative uh an increase in the amount of the treasuries being financed by highly levered players like big hedge funds who were hurt or or or incented to stop buying them as the yield curve flattened because they were basically making a carry uh taking on a carry trade uh and then some regulatory issues where banks either were getting close to or were afraid of getting close to regulatory limits on leverage that the treasury's counted against and they backed away from that market and so ultimately uh that was a sim that was the supply demand dynamics that fed into the repo rate spike that forced the fed to grow their balance sheet to ameliorate the problem and it also eventually led to as we saw in april of last year a suspension of some regulations as it related to treasuries for the banking sector in the us the slr regulations which uh meant that the fed or excuse me u.s banking system uh under certain circumstances wouldn't have to count treasury bonds against their leverage ratios so the some of the leverage constraints have been removed um the yield curve has steepened and so there has been uh in theory some of that leveraged trade has been brought back that hedge funds could be marginal buyers fx hedge treasury yields particularly for japanese buyers but also for europeans have risen significantly they are positive again we wrote about this a bit uh in last week's uh tree rings report uh and so in theory marginal uh foreign buying of treasuries is probably uh up uh and and certainly better than it was in september of 2019 given where those fx hedge treasury yields are um and so it really is a kind and and those importantly are a function of the dollar falling the dollar was 98 or whatever it was in september 19 it's 90 now so um it's a fluid situation ultimately the underlying fundamental problem is size of u.s treasury issuance how much of that issuance is being done at the short end and as we've shown that uh uh 75 percent plus as of uh a few months back was being done at six months or less the question then is is why is the government issuing so much in the treasury market at six months or less um and there's really only two feasible reasons in our view number one uh treasury doesn't know that it's the best time in a hundred years to extend maturity as far as they can which strains credulity or the demand or the amount of demand for long-dated us treasuries is not nearly what people say it is and that's really the only possible explanation so they keep issuing this stuff at the short end because there's not a strong enough bid at the back end if they try to displace too much of this at the back end yields will rise significantly at the 10-year level which is really your policy rate for the government they will hurt the housing market hurt the economy and so they're stuck basically so uh that is going to be the challenge of trying to manage those factors and they all sort of move around depending on what the dollar does depending on what issuance does depending on what the economy is doing etc so hopefully that gives you some sense of sort of the factors to watch uh and and what the dollar does gives you a really good sense of of how tight the liquidity is around all of that let's see from jeffrey thanks for all your hard work please you're welcome thanks for tuning in please discuss inflation in regards to the us dollar uh being devalued in the economic consequences so all else equal the dollar goes down inflation will go up because we import uh whatever we import call it 500 billion a year in goods um and so if the the key is you got to get inflation up and then you have to not allow interest rates to rise commensurate with that rise in inflation to offset the gains or the the benefit of delivering from the higher inflation and that's where the yield curve control comes in so it really speaks to a way to de-lever uh the us government to de-lever corporates consumers um households on the backs of the real purchasing power of bondholders that is the game plan um it speaks to owning assets that do well when real interest rates are negative and so they've been trying to do that they've had some success uh there are more aggressive things they could do in theory uh but that's the dynamic of of what the consequences would be it's a hoped for slow de-levering of the balance sheet without having to do a massive devaluation all at once any thoughts on the game stop squeeze um it's interesting um just in terms of i i think people talk about the decentralization of finance around uh d5 and bitcoin and crypto but i think this is another example of it where you've got uh basically a swarm of people on robin hood uh able to log in on reddit and basically short squeeze a major hedge fund it's it's just sort of interesting it's kind of a kind of a fourth turning thing as well uh from jim please explain the mechanics of paper gold contracts controlling gold prices yeah so it's it's the easiest way to think about it ultimately is if there is demand for gold there are two ways to address it you can have the price of the underlying gold go up or you can have the number of claims on the underlying gold go up and historically uh because gold is centralized uh and the sort of the the central ground zero for all of this is is the london gold market it is uh what has happened is the amount of paper claims on gold have been allowed to rise significantly there are no great data sources on how big that leverage is um and so that is how um that is how it is used is basically the the expansion of paper leverage instead of the rise in prices let's see from pv you often mention that the fed is cornered in supporting equity prices as they are critical to us gdp can you please elaborate on the connection between equity prices and gdp yes uh so net capital gains plus taxable ira distributions are 200 percent of u.s personal consumption expenditure or pce growth pce is two-thirds of u.s gdp and uh so ultimately uh it is mathematically difficult if not impossible for pce to rise if stocks aren't rising and asset prices aren't rising and if can pce isn't rising it's mathematically difficult or impossible for gdp to rise and if gdp doesn't rise tax receipts don't rise if tax receipts don't rise when you've got 135 percent that the gdp you have a debt crisis and so basically uh through a multi-step daisy chain uh falling stocks uh will result before very long in a debt crisis for the united states people would say well a hallmark of a debt crisis is rising yields uh rising treasury yields while stocks sold off i would say you're right and i would say that's exactly what happened march 9th to march 18 2020 and i would say that's exactly why the fed stepped in with 625 billion per week an unprecedented amount to stop that from happening you've mentioned the multi-currency pricing of oil helps explain why oil price is so low what impact have we seen on yuan pricing of other commodities great question hussein uh so far um it has not been the same i don't think i quite frankly i've not spent as much time on iron and iron ore and copper because those are two of the other big ones where i've seen the contracts i think they're at a younger stage uh all else equal you would expect the same dynamic to happen which is to say um unless the dollar falls those commodity prices won't rise that much but i just haven't done that much work on those i've been more focused on the oil side let's see from michael can you comment on the velocity of bitcoin 300 000 transactions daily 110 million annually at 20 000 each is 2.2 trillion yet only probably 10 million bitcoin actually circulate due to what has been lost and savers this is the one piece of bitcoin that i just can't wrap my head around from a valuation standpoint especially in light of lynn alden's recent valuation piece using quantity theory of money thanks for the consideration love the reports thank you michael um this is the first time i've looked at this so i'm uh it's a it's a very good question i haven't had a chance to read that from lynn uh yet either let's see um for me i guess ultimately it it comes out in price and i think speaks to the volatility we've seen where um you'd expect to see massive volatility given sort of the relatively big volumes flowing through the relatively small amount of bitcoin that you highlight and so i think that's probably without having a chance to dive through all of that to me what those numbers say to me gut instinct is that uh volatility of bitcoins likely to remain high given those dynamics uh and then ultimately as bitcoin's market cap rises on high volatility uh that volatility should over time shrink um as the as the in in theory the transactions and velocity as a percent of market caps shrink as the price rises so that that's how i would answer that but that's a great question let's see from uh from max max how are you thoughts on bit uh sorry bitcoin thoughts on pboc stance this week easy for me to say uh draining liquidity less accommodative talking about slowing froth in markets it's very interesting to me i was looking at a chart today that showed the repo rate in china at 2.75 and the repo rate in the united states at negative one basis point and i think some of what is going on i think they probably are trying to drain some froth but i'm also wondering if this isn't part of sort of ongoing uh capital slash currency wars where you're seeing both sides the u.s and china uh the u.s has had uh as we've written about in our work recently uh several different uh policymaker comments and op-eds talking about the need uh to effectively uh uh prevent or begin to get concerned about the amount of capital flows flowing to china uh for example goldman sachs said last week of the week prior they expect 140 billion dollars of bond flows to china this year which uh that's uh the way certain u.s policy makers look at that i suspect is that's 140 billion dollars that should be flowing into the treasury market that are not because china offers a better rate and so uh after adjusting for the currency uh so uh is this china to me it's either china just doing what they're saying they're doing which is draining liquidity trying to take some froth out or uh trying to maintain an advantage of being more attractive source uh or destination uh excuse me for for capital uh hi luke love trading from dean uh hi luke love tree rings thank you how does holding a gold affect the balance sheet of a commercial bank like jp morgan i believe it is still uh um [music] held as an asset i believe it's lumped in with fx uh at this point and so there are uh a haircut for holding it uh and i don't have more details than that unfortunately um is how it would be treated at the commercial bank level from max how what are you looking for in fed minutes tomorrow are they really going to shoot across the bow with a tape or tightening hint gun to my head no i don't think they will um but you know it's i am the old two-handed economist rather than one-handed i don't think they will is the short answer i think they are trying to string this along as long as they can i think they want to uh try to jawbone without jawboning uh to try to restrain some of the levels of froth that we're seeing across a number of different asset markets without actually having to go all the way to hey we're going to taper but i'll be watching it with great interest expound on your recent comment about midwest real estate feeling as bubbly as some stocks and sectors thoughts on reasons behind it especially with rates rising quickly yeah so recently i i've noticed that it's not just we're seeing things in midwestern housing markets that have long been sleepy parma ohio indianapolis indiana uh i saw on my twitter feed omaha nebraska um where you're seeing bidding wars houses going for seventy five thousand fifty thousand dollars over asking all cash etc um what i think is happening at least in part is that uh baby boomers own some big chunk of the 30 trillion dollars plus in retirement assets and uh once they reach a certain age they have to have a required minimum distribution works out to about three percent a year four percent a year starting at age 70 and a half so as boomers get the 70 and a half they got to start taking out in aggregate you know let's say they own let's say they own 20 of the 30 trillion so they got to start taking out 600 billion to 800 billion a year mandated they can throw some of that into bond markets or if they have concerns about currency or paying attention to what's going on or just don't like the fact they're getting paid no yield in the bond market they might consider buying a house for rental properties they might consider buying a house for their kids uh and i think that is what is happening hi luke you often mentioned that you invest in uh gold silver uh and bitcoin and tech stocks are you not worried about a market crash when it comes to tech how are you protecting against this highly inflated market uh for me i'm just looking at things on a relative basis and to me the uh issue it always comes back to the biggest bubble is the government bond market where uh you have uh a debt to gdp of 135 percent obligations of another 500 to a thousand percent um and so you have this need for uh to keep rates from reaching any market level they have to be kept at politically expedient levels which suggests an ongoing need for negative real rates and increasingly negative real rates as the debt and obligations increase so uh for me it's it's really um it comes down to what i rather own a share of microsoft or a treasury bond microsoft would i rather own a share of google or my or treasury bond google would i rather own um you know intel or you you get the point there are some of the more frothy ones that i i probably there's a level on yields where that would start to reconsider or if we see we've seen the early phases of uh of a reflation trade and that's we've always said hey i like industrials i like tech i think the industrials would benefit continue to benefit from a reflation trade you'd maybe move some into there but that's that's how i think about the the high levels of valuation of tech relative to the higher levels of valuation implied in government bond markets is there from ian is there a scenario where the dollar gold and bitcoin go up together yes i do um i think ultimately if you get a situation where something happens in the eurozone something happens to china then i think you could get those things happening i think if you had some sort of other um some sort of big sovereign risk off where uh you basically are for forcing and unwinding the dollar market um but it also concerns the u.s so the dollar is the cleanest dirty shirt in fiat but then you also still have people interested you know there's wanting to be hedging or a realization that um you know if if the eurozone blew up dollar would go up uh you might even see gold go and bitcoin go down initially on that but i think people would very quickly realize it's only a matter of time till either authorities step in or until the banking system uh el er in the us has a problem and that requires a response uh so uh ultimately i do think you can see that but i think it would probably be fairly short-lived from derek thanks for your hard work you're welcome thank you unfortunately in canada the maximum mortgage terms 10 years based on your various potential outcomes do you envision g7 central banks and governments being forced to rate drastically raise interest rates within 10 years uh 10 years a long time i would answer it this way i don't think they can drastically raise rates until the underlying fiat currencies are significantly devalued to reduce the real interest rate burden of governments themselves because otherwise drastically raising interest rates is only going to bankrupt them and they won't go bankrupt they will simply have the central banks print what's needed so that's um until rate uh currencies are significantly devalued i don't think that'll happen uh how do you envision kyc impacting bitcoin do you have a view on timing from dan i think it's i think kyc's already started i don't think it's a bad thing that they have kyc uh i think that will bring more institutions into the market and so to me there's probably this gap in time from kyc as it gets big begins to hurt the highly levered or the rumored to be highly levered offshore bitcoin market and that could cause some downside i suppose in the near term but ultimately it's sort of this baton pass from that market the offshore unregulated market to the onshore regulated market where um there's a lot more dollar flows there's a lot less leverage in theory that would be good for price it'd be good for volatility in other words reduced volatility over time both as price rose and as there were less levered flows moving into bitcoin so i think um i i don't think kyc is a bad thing i think it's it's a good thing uh from norm luke is the fed actually surfacing the paper it is bought via treasury issuance um so isn't this debt essentially a mirage of the fed and treasury can cancel the debt leave all of the non-fed held debt outstanding isn't this an option versus the draconian move for the fed to revalue gold as a means to fund the spending needs of treasury why is this debt cancellation idea not an obvious way to reduce the debt to gdp problem uh i i think it is probably a way you could do it i would argue that gold and other reserve assets would respond equities would respond were you to do that um and and from what i've been told policy makers uh are thinking about it in these terms in other words um i've been told that that they say the only the only the the uh the debt held by the public matters uh which is which tells you they're thinking along these types of lines so um it's a little bit of um this it's a little bit of semantics they could certainly do it the question then would be would the fed then have to buy the issuance going forward because people would it would it would a little bit um remove pull back the curtain or remove the mirage that they've said hey this is you know these are separate entities that would it would it would further tear down that wall so that i think there would be implications but it wouldn't be as extreme as revaluing gold i think you're right there thoughts on saudi opec cutting production when art berman said on macro voices said u.s supply is about to fall off a cliff in early 2021 is ksa unaware are they adding fuel to a future short squeeze in oil price later this year i would highly doubt saudi's unaware of what would happen with shale is it possible there's some sort of deal where saudi cuts production opec cuts production while the u.s cuts production drives price up and then they recycle some of those back into the u.s uh for financing flows uh that the quid pro quo is we kill our biden kills shale and then saudi uh supports more with financial flows into the u.s that would seem to be possible to me uh maybe there's some of that happening it would speak to higher dollar oil prices later this year were that the case uh from michael wonder if the plan powers that be plan on including bitcoin and or gold and sdr somehow during some sort of great reset um to me if you include gold in the sdr and make it convertible you might as well only make it gold because everyone's going to want to try to convert it for gold everything else for gold uh because it's sort of the the the hardest currency of the five um within the sdr uh to me i think it is some sort of maybe a link through sdr where you set the price of gold in sdrs and then everybody has to settle deficits and sdrs that's one way of doing it in theory they could do it with bitcoin as well but i don't i see it more likely being gold than bitcoin let's see here what happens with the short positions in gold held by investment banks if it's revalued i think it depends on who holds the short positions i think if uh if the banks are short gold i think they'll be cash settled at the priority's close so in other words the people with the longs retail investors speculators etc will be cash settled at the prior days close and not participate in the upside uh if the banks are net long paper gold or net long derivative positions when a revaluation happens i think they will get paid in whole that is effectively what happened in 2008 with the credit default swaps um aig etc basically whatever is needed to be done to keep the banks solvent will be done is i think the way to think about that so uh if they're short they'll screw the the long paper holders and if the banks are long they will make the the banks whole what's your view on the lack of on the risk of a lack of collateral treasuries to repo lending to cause serious disruptions in the financial system how could this play out you know this is i wrestle with this a bit ultimately i guess the the us could certainly run a lot bigger deficits to address this the fed could i think in the short run do reverse repos to supply the treasuries um needed for this so i think there are some things they could do so i don't think it's a huge risk at the moment but um it's really a question that is uh better asked of of guys like zoltan pozar etc than me from guy it feels as if bitcoin has free reign to run as a hedge against all this turmoil while gold is being manipulated or kept in check are your views changing regarding gold since it can't seem to break the mold i wouldn't say my views are changing my views are uh i would say evolving that i think i i had hoped gold would run um as things happen i increasingly think gold will do what it is likely going to do in my view all at once so over a weekend over a week over a month and people will either be there or they will not um and so it's basically you know gold catching up towards bitcoin all at once instead of moving lockstep people like kyle bass and mike green have been suggesting the likelihood of a mark to market annual tax on bitcoin do i see it as a possibility i would never say never i guess um i think it would be challenged in the courts i'm not a lawyer but private property has never been taxed in that way it would be a very um it would be a very dangerous precedent it would amount to property seizure by the u.s government uh and i would think it would drive 600 billion in capital associated with bitcoin overseas uh at a time when the united states quite frankly needs the capital um so i i would be surprised but like i said i would never say never uh there we go okay uh the basel three we talked we touched on that one uh before luke what is the best way to buy mining stocks one of the best miners stocks you know i've i've never gone into the individuals for me i've always looked at it as i want to own uh majors i'm conservative i want to own majors with uh most of their uh production in um or all of their production in countries with a tradition of property rights and anglo-american law so u.s canada alaska to reduce the risk of seizure by the government from max you mentioned recently in a tweet you have solar and geothermal heating at home can you expound on the thought process for that we've been looking to have an off-grid option for our energy home energy needs as well uh yeah so i built my house in 08 at the time i thought that energy prices uh natural gas etc would continue to rise i was wrong about natural gas galactically so um with that said my energy bill is still my natural gas utility bill has still risen so it wasn't a disaster so no we've got a belt and suspenders and and drawstring approach we've got a natural gas uh backup we have geothermal thermal primary so we've got the geothermal lines they do the base heating natural gas secondary which also warms it up the solar panels reduce the electrical uh pull and then i've also got a couple of wood-burning stoves which uh um so the gist of it is as as i've never had a natural gas bill more than probably 20 or 30 dollars in a month uh in cleveland ohio and i've never had a air conditioning bill and we run the ac all summer uh that never more than ever an electrical bill of more than a couple hundred bucks so um it's really i just thought of it as i'm gonna invest the money and look at it as basically a bond uh where my payback comes over time and reduced energy bills and the coupon effectively gets bigger over time as the savings increases as there's some natural inflation that takes place with rise in my uh utility bills from suzanne you've mentioned the possibility of the central bank revaluing uh gold to improve their balance sheets since gold is marked to market with a global trade how could the central banks reprice it uh they've got printing presses so they could do it one of a couple ways they could simply do open market operations in the same way that they've done with the bonds which is we're gonna we're gonna buy them and yields are globally where central banks say yields are same thing with gold ultimately central banks if they wanted to could buy gold and put the price where they want it to be their printing press is infinite you could also have oil countries do this if they wanted to in theory i think that's a where they say we now value gold at 1 000 barrels per ounce and uh if they did that it would force uh an adjustment in either the price of oil or the price of gold uh one way or another from jan the dollar is down today and the 10-year yield is trending lower and yet gold silver and miners seen controlled any sense as to how long paper markets will control physical no unfortunately it's one of these things where we've said before that uh it it it's the the improving fundamentals for gold are not going to matter until they matter and i like i said before i think increasingly uh you know we had a nice run last year in gold but i think increasingly it's looking like they may matter effectively all at once from antonia how could gold be revalued much higher with no regard to the production cost uh through the through the printing press if the fed if if the fed wanted to bid for gold it could do so at whatever price uh they and and uh in the same way that they can set prices for bonds with open market operations expand on thoughts regarding mike green reference to marks and how that ties to separation of reserve assets from the medium of exchange so i tweeted yesterday there was a great interview with mike green nick carter that grant williams moderated and i was really surprised because because i i know mike mike's brilliant he made this comment that was effectively uh from each according to his ability to each according to his need uh out of straight out of karl marx is in terms of speaking out against bitcoin uh is part of an argument against bitcoin and to me i i just think it the fix that we need to have what has really driven a lot of the problems we have in our currency system right now is the fact that the us dollar is the primary reserve currency and the us treasury bonds still a primary reserve asset and if you separate those two so you have medium of exchange dollar and probably other reserve currencies as well as we talked about with multi-currency energy pricing uh and then a neutral reserve asset that floats in all currencies to settle imbalances whether that's gold whether it's bitcoin whether that's sdr's tied to one or the other um ultimately that then uh would allow the dollar to weaken as we run deficits and allow us to compete uh and and begin producing things again uh because as we ran deficits we would need to buy uh more and more of the reserve asset or excuse me we would have to settle more and more of the reserve asset or our currency would fall against the reserve asset well as the uh the debt the creditor arrangements would rise versus the reserve asset and so the dollar would get more competitive vis-a-vis our creditors like the yuan like the euro and uh then we would uh be able to rebalance trade a bit more and uh rebalance our economy rebalance some of the politics a lot more uh let's see where where would the gold come from for the fed to buy it all the gold in the registered category at the comex is only 95 billion at 5 000. the the the man the manual is basically remonetizing the gold sitting uh in washing or the uh the united states gold so the 261 million ounces uh is what i'm referring to there so basically they're just talking about marking that up and it's a way to create dollars in the tga without a commensurate rise in federal debt outstanding is where that would come from so it would they would in theory be able to buy or could in theory buy in the open market after that but as far as that exercise i mentioned before about the every four thousand dollars is a trillion dollars and it getting deposited in the tga by virtue of the accounting of it that was in reference to the 261 million ounces that the united states owns from peter in an insolvency crisis do you expect the miners to also have a short-term crash along with the stock market yeah i think in an insolvency crisis if it's really bad as we saw last march it's it's dollars when uh in the near term and nothing else wins and as we were saying at the time i was quite frankly surprised how quickly it happened but ultimately that dynamic will continue until the treasury market is threatened and once the treasury market's threatened then those dollars will come fast and furious which is what we saw last last march from mike hey luke least to most probable in your opinion lower dollar and higher equities vice versa or same direction either up or down it's a bit of a trick question mike it's tough from a standpoint of uh least to most probable so in the short run lower dollar and higher equities i actually think in the short run higher dollar and slightly lower equities is more probable than lower dollar and higher equities uh but then i think the further out you get i think once you start getting a little bit lower equities then you're on the clock for lower dollar and higher equities i think the fed is trying to manage between these two um uh and we'll see how much uh how how much longer they can keep this going on but that's really been uh the dynamic for the last five or six years you have stronger dollar weaker equities and then weaker dollars stronger equities and vice versa and these cycles keep getting shorter and shorter and shorter and at some point um then i think it the the rubber is going to meet the road and you get ultimately much lower dollar um probably much higher equities but there's a way you could get much lower dollar much lower equities depending on what happens with capital flows we recently mentioned that you are buying more bitcoin you're not a financial advisor but you can tell can you tell us what's your personal allocation of bitcoin and gold miners versus stocks other i would lump uh it is a it is it is probably between gold gold miners and bitcoin it's probably uh in excess of 25 at this point uh relative to stocks and everything else and that's of my liquid investable assets i've got you know when you look at fftt and other uh as a business i own i don't include that in that number understand the process of reducing debt via yield curve control and inflation as well as global regime change global reserve regime change wondering how much consideration you give to being in a purely fiat world now perhaps reducing the downside risk and prolonging the slow growth process um let's see um the process to me that's when you talk about reducing the downside risk that's really what this is the fiat expansion has all been about ultimately i don't think the central banks are bad guys i don't think they're trying to increase wealth inequality i think what they're trying to do is prevent a catastrophic de-levering of the system where unemployment is reduced uh by reducing the denominator in other words uh you unemployment is number of people and unemployed over a number of people and i think the thing that scares the central banks more than anything and what they're trying to do is prevent uh the unemployment rate from falling in a severe depression by having the number of unemployed stay where it is but the number of people in the denominator shrink due to just severe uh deflation unwind etc that's what i think they are concerned about and so i don't i do think that the fiat central bank expansion game debasement game is really all about that that said they run a fine line because if they go too far with that game and you get into uh and disorderly uh dish hoarding of fiat currencies then you run the risk of the same type of uh problem except via hyperinflation from bruce what are your thoughts on the fed quietly announcing just before christmas it will change the way it reports money supply grouping m1 and m2 together as well as reporting once a month versus currently every week i hadn't noticed that bruce thank you very much um no comment i i just i mean it's interesting to me but that's the first i've heard of it all right last couple here i pause i'm not gonna be able to get to everything uh but i know we started late so i wanted to make sure to run a bit longer last couple to confirm is your base case real demand pull inflation or some kind of stagflation scenario i'm struggling to get my head around how demand pull inflation can happen in a debt-based economy where the only entity taking on new debt is the government who will most likely renege on their obligations to the central bank and with credit contracting in most sectors other than housing my base case is uh that for inflation is that the government is growing rapidly as a percentage of the economy government of bank bank sector loans to the u.s government are rising rapidly as a percent of total bank loans and we're going to hit a tipping point on current course and track where the government becomes a big enough for the majority of the economy and of uh bank lending and suddenly the measure that most analysts and macro analysts economists have been watching for inflation in the united states which is what is private sector bank lending doing becomes increasingly irrelevant because what it what becomes the key driver is is what is the us government doing and it's very much a u.s economy with chinese characteristics model it's very much centrally planned but if the us government is spending all kinds of money and the us government goes from 22 24 of gdp today bank loans to the us government are rising 35 to 40 percent um we're not it's not going to take that long for the u.s government's deficits um particularly if they're handing out money to people increasing amounts doing ubi to begin showing up in real world supply demand dynamics and then layering on top of that the currency depreciation induced inflation as a result of what is really an ongoing and accelerating move away from the dollar in global energy markets global fx reserves etc so that's why i think we're in this sort of transition from no inflation towards inflation um uh and that's that's my base case the for me the only question is how long will it take and i think it's going to become much more obvious as we move through 2021 then when we get into 2022 and into 23 i think it gets really obvious and things get interesting because then you get into okay rates rise paul volcker ain't coming this time fed's gonna have to come in cap rates and that means defense balance sheets gonna have to rise faster not shrink in response to inflation so people are thinking this inflation's gonna be a little little little and then kind of up a little and linear and i'm thinking it's it's going to go fro all at once okay uh from ben luke legard and yellen have not mentioned gold but appear worried by bitcoin this indicates they believe they have complete control of gold agree uh can they paint the tape enough to dissuade gold bugs and use bitcoin interest to distract and help before hitting bitcoin with regulation i i think possible um that might even be the game plan uh ultimately the challenge they have with bitcoin is it's hard to have these uh these these derivatives the unallocated expansion and the cash settle derivatives um and the way they do with gold because it's easier to buy physical bitcoin physical bitcoin an actual bitcoin than it is with gold right i can get on my phone here and um buy a bitcoin if i think the price is down a whole bunch and um i can buy gold if the gold price is down but that's just paper gold buying physical gold is is sort of difficult which i think is one of the attractions of it but ultimately this centralization of gold makes it easier for them to manipulate gold and the decentralization of bitcoin harder for them to manipulate bitcoin all right and let's see here one more from dean can the u.s do anything to lower the dollar slowly given that all of our trade partners have figured out to combat that via u.s asset purchases i think they've been trying to do it it's just been sort of choppy where they they they the dollar gets lowered and then quite frankly it feels like they've they've tried to support the dollar that they being the u.s uh at key points i i think the world is moving away from the dollar um you know it's interesting your treasury purchases since 2014 by foreign central banks are net zero they haven't bought a single treasury bond in seven years uh and so you know it moves up and it moves down but ultimately um you're seeing a steady move away from the dollar and so to me it's more the u.s doing things to manage the rate of decline rather than the other way around so with that i am going to um wrap it up for here i've been going for a little over an hour uh again i appreciate everyone joining uh and really appreciate the opportunity to interact with everybody these kinds of sessions are my favorite to do because this is just informal it's and and we can kind of bring up the issues of the day so thank you everybody again for being on our mailing list for being uh uh with fftt and for this conversation and i look forward to chatting with all of you very soon everybody have a great night [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] you
"Comments on non-USD oil, real rates, Peak Cheap Oil",2024-01-09 18:00:02+00:00,18,11nnaP9MbyQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11nnaP9MbyQ,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope everybody had a great weekend uh hope everyone enjoyed that bills chiefs game last night that was uh um it's a shame somebody had to lose that game so at any rate i'm going to jump right in here uh first question is from andrew can you explain more about gold's potential rise with oil in the coming years and what their relationship is or may continue to be sure to oversimplify it's unwise to store surpluses uh in debt that has negative real yields versus oil if you're an oil producer right so in other words uh if oil rises seven to ten percent per year let's just pick a range uh because of peak cheap oil geology that we're seeing de facto at the end of seven years the oil producer is going to have if he stores his surpluses in negative yielding debt uh on a real basis negative real yielding debt versus oil on a real basis that oil producer is going to have in oil terms about half as much oil as he did when he started he's better off leaving it in the ground and so uh if they want to avoid that outcome they need to buy a reserve asset whose value can also rise in real terms so that at the end of that seven year period of oil rising they will be able to buy the same amount of or more oil with their surpluses otherwise they're just losing and that something historically has been gold and that's why if you look over long stretches uh gold holds its value versus oil uh dollars and debt don't okay secondly uh patrick from patrick luke thoughts on why bitcoin has been trading seemingly in line with tech stocks rather than as a flight to safety or value store like gold and silver do you see any catalysts that could help bitcoin decouple from risk on equities i think ultimately it's over leverage that is driving it um i mean it's i've been as it relates to gold i've been very surprised how well gold has held in given what real rates have done over the last several weeks so last several weeks with real rates bouncing as hard as they have off the lows uh i would have thought gold would be down 150 to 200 per ounce it hasn't been it's actually up a bit so i've been surprised how strong gold has been in the face of that uh ultimately in my view uh the catalyst the key catalyst for bitcoin and gold remain increasingly negative real rates needed for sovereigns to earn their way to inflate their way out of high levels of sovereign debt post covid crisis also think the near term cash catalyst will be an eventual capitulation uh by the fed on rate hikes in 2022. now i think ultimately bitcoin is still acting as an fx hedge as a hedge it's a hedge of fx depreciation over time it also correlates with the nasdaq and long duration assets and and real rates like i said i think it's important no bitcoin is trading like gold did in weimar germany uh it's trading like gold did in argentina venezuela turkey more recently which is to say even in weimar germany when the german as the as the reichsmark was going uh basically hyperinflating away to zero against gold um in one of the great hyperinflations of all time there were still four five six times where uh on a month-over-month basis uh when the german government said something political about austerity or whatever they were doing the german rights mark rose significantly against gold gold collapsed against the reichsmark uh as the rexmark was ultimately going to zero against gold and so i'm not saying that the the the gold is going or excuse me the dollar is going to hyperinflate like weimar germany uh that's not my base case i think it's a very big tail risk i do think that the us is well along the way to argentina with u.s characteristics and i think we need only look around uh to see the evidence of that building almost on a monthly basis over the last several years my point though is that you got to stay conservative with your leverage um like i said even in one of the great hyperinflations of all time somebody who barrio borrowed too much bought gold against the german reichsmark lost it all four five even six times in three years okay next question from diaz favorite non-bitcoin or gold investment with a five to ten year time horizon i would probably say uh a combination of of of a basket of oil copper and agricultural assets along with commodities that benefit from electric vehicles and there's some etfs that you can buy that are electric vehicle related etfs i believe uh if you're looking for low carrying costs from a tax perspective it's hard to beat farmland farmland is very rich right now uh in terms of of pricing relative to crop output but historically uh farm us farmland has correlated with usm2 money supplies over time uh it has a real yield that adjusts with crop prices and i we've been talking a bit more about water in the last three months um water i think is going to be increasingly critical the easiest way for a layman to play water uh is to own farmland uh basically importing food is just importing water a derivative of water and so um it's especially i think a good way to own water because i don't think people are going to be allowed to own water i think it's going to be too politically sensitive so i'll pause there on that one uh from sms what are you doing to hedge yourself against the 20 decline in markets overall um it's a good question um i would say first back earlier in 2021 i sold enough bitcoin at 48 000 uh give or take to uh to pay off my house and so for me my thought was look if bitcoin crashes from here goes to zero and never comes back or crashes and never comes back up then at least i got a house out of it uh and so i don't think bitcoin is going to crash and never come back i don't think bitcoin's going to zero i continue to own uh a lot of bitcoin but i'm a conservative guy by nature and this is just a way of de-risking beforehand uh i haven't been through a few cycles before just hey this is my worst case now i know my downside i've defined my downside and i can measure my upside uh um you know the the risk that i have uh with what i still have on the table so to speak more recently i've been letting cash levels increase not really from selling anything but just in terms of different businesses that we own uh have cash flows coming in i'm letting those cash flows build up in the bank uh and as they do i'm looking to deploy them i don't feel like there's enough blood in the streets yet still uh i'll be watching for that to see uh looking to basically deploy that money and into asset prices or into assets excuse me gold bitcoin uh commodity related assets industrials um with with those funds as i i think we still have a little bit more pain to feel uh from rizzo an explan an explanation of the balance of payments equation would be helpful you frequently speak of the us running dual deficits and having a balance of payments problems sure so the the balance of payments equation is simply the current account deficit which is your fiscal deficit trade deficit equals your capital account surplus or vice versa you run a capital account deficit then you must run a current account surplus either via your fiscal or trade or both uh trade surpluses or both by design the system that we have had since 1971 in particular is we sell assets to buy stuff um lately we've been selling a lot of u.s tech stocks to foreigners to effectively finance our purchases of foreign goods and the united states government's uh fiscal deficit the challenge i guess really is that if tech stocks fall and or or foreign or stop buying tech stocks we likely can't they likely can't or won't buy enough treasuries to balance the balance of payments equation in which case the release valve uh to balance that identity will likely become the international trade value of the dollar in other words the dollar will fall to balance that equation so hopefully that helps some of the framework that we've been talking about recently uh from odysseus what do you think about russia's announcement of a potential gold-backed stable coin or crypto amidst the ukraine war-mongering rhetoric is this russia putting a shot across the bow and alluding to its us dollar trump card and threatening gold backing i did see that article i thought it was pretty interesting in my opinion it might be a shot across the bow i don't know how the the person who said it was a member of the russian duma which i as i understand it is their uh house of representatives uh and so i don't know if that was a senior person with a lot of clout or if that was you know one of the equivalents of a junior congress person here who's just speaking off the cuff so uh let's assume that they were serious that they do have some clout um i think it's a really interesting point because i think it's something that u.s policy makers are just completely blind to which is if they kick russia out of swift a this would be a nuclear reaction in terms of um a response from russia but they could very easily just say listen we now value physical gold at a thousand barrels of oil per ounce uh it would instantaneously revalue russia's massive gold reserves using russia's own oil production number one uh and really in oil terms is really the only terms that really matters energy is the key is the key resource it's it's just the money is simply an expression of energy and it would force the west to do one of two things either revalue their gold significantly higher uh in order to allow oil prices to stay economic for u.s shale to produce right because of russia the biggest energy produced in the world says oil is one one thousandth of an ounce of gold uh in the united states uh right now oil is 83 and gold's 1800 so you're talking right now oil is 122nd of an ounce of gold so russia's oil would be way cheaper than shale so either the west would have to revalue gold way higher thereby having significant impacts on the structure of the global dollar system or they would the west would see oil prices collapse to 1 1000 of an ounce of gold or 1800 divided by a thousand so oil will go to a buck 80. there isn't a shale well in the united states that is remotely close to profitable at a buck 80 a barrel shale shuts down and now we have oil uh supply problems we're much more dependent on russia because they have changed their pricing to undercut everybody else so uh you can see strategically how that would play out like i said i think that's the nuclear option for russia with that said iran moved to gold in 2012 uh turkey moved to gold in 2012 uae was selling gas in 2012 using gold uh and so there is precedent for this and again that was after iran got kicked out of the swift system in 2012 so let's watch let's see uh from cp why does the financial media allow the fed to lie about the cpi rate uh i think it's understated uh cpi uh why is that done it's done by every almost every sovereign historically domestically here today in 2022 the u.s media thrives on access not on reporting and i think that's important to understand so if they talked about the true rates of inflation or talk them up it would result in the revocation or limiting of access to fed officials us government officials and that in turn would lose them credibility with their sponsors and their readers uh and their listeners and that would hurt them in the wallet and so uh that's why they don't and why does the fed and us government work to undermine uh or understate inflation well that's purely in service to the debt market right so lower inflation equals lower yields and 25 years ago lower inflation meant lower yields that was a convenience it was just lower interest expense no biggie higher asset prices hey great now with us that the debt the gdp this high and off-balance sheet liabilities coming on balance sheet because of the baby boomers retiring it's a matter of national security to understate inflation they absolutely need to understate inflation so that interest rates stay low and it makes it easier to keep uh to inflate away the bond market if if you say cpi is three and it's really eight and the bond market believes you that it's really three you're gaining five percent per year in purchasing power at the expense of bondholders and that's what sovereigns do so it is what it is but that's why i think it happens the way it does from rd what kind of drawdown on equity market will cause powell to roll over what's more likely concession to quell market fear a pullback on rate hikes or a pullback on qt also had a couple questions about how high is too high from the for the dollar i think whatever decline in the market is enough to create rising treasury yields in a market decline and or send the u.s economic indices into recessionary levels uh practically speaking i think that's probably down another 10 to 15 percent from here on the s p worst case it is interesting today you saw the ism services index get borderline recessionary at a 50 reading now that's not a purely clean number because of omicron so i don't want to get carried away with that you're also seeing yields at the long end not do that great with the market down you know the dow down a thousand points whatever that is two and a half percent three percent um so let's watch and see it seems like maybe we're starting to bump up against that a little but i don't want to get too carried away on two too few data points uh in terms of what level on the dixie dxy is too high i think it's probably 98 to 100 and that's whatever level starts to break starts to put enough pressure on foreigners that have dollar borrowings that they start to sell dollar assets and it starts that vicious cycle downward of falling us dollar asset prices leading to reduced u.s consumption leading to reduced u.s tax receipts receipts leading to increased us borrowing against foreign selling uh yields up as stocks go down the dynamic that vicious cycle we saw in march 2020 in spades that was only broken when the fed went to 625 billion dollars per week in qe uh and then finally from ryan is sitting on a 10 to 15 percent cash a bad idea as we wait for the fed theater to end what do you think about taking profits and holding a strong cash position in these times i i think having 10 to 15 cash makes sense uh given what we're seeing um like i said i've worked cash up just not by selling anything but by virtue of as cash flow has come in from various businesses um allowing it to sit in the bank for the moment not putting it to work uh as quickly as i was certainly a year ago at this time where um it was i was was waving in a number of different types of assets gold bitcoin uh etc uh stocks so uh i will leave it at that as always thank you very much for joining me it was great catching up uh if you would like to see more information about these types of updates in a written form check out fftt

What is the “right” level of rates?  Why does a strong USD drive UST market “dysfunction”?,2023-12-19 17:00:47+00:00,23,yu8r46Su-mk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu8r46Su-mk,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope you're well uh and that everybody had a great weekend it uh beautiful weather here yesterday particularly for cleveland 82 degrees which is pretty nice for this time of year it's probably been the nicest spring we've had in maybe 20 years so at any rate let me jump in for tonight a few few questions here the first one is from georges here monetary policy is about who wins it's a political decision if this is true why would the politicians go for inflation when the main losers would be those on a fixed income like the baby boomers politically this way out's a very bad choice why would they do this and and the to me the answer is because nobody's a bigger debtor than the government uh and i agree it's all about politics but let's take a look at the situation the the the political authority the u.s government sovereigns more broadly are the biggest debtors uh they have complete control of the printing press and they have complete control of the inflation statistics and so i suspect we're going to look back in five ten years history books will look back and and say how did anybody think postcode that the outcome was going to be deflation given that the political authority desperately needs inflation is the biggest debtor has the printing press and prints the inflation statistics next question is from sv what would be the biggest or best investment theme for the next 10 years to me i think certainly for the next five years and maybe the next 10 years is that u.s nate real rates are going to far more negative levels than virtually anybody thinks uh consensus as far as i can tell is still that u.s rio rates bottomed at negative one point one percent in august of last year i think at a minimum they're going to negative five to ten percent uh and i think they could go lower than that and the reason i think that is if you look back to the last time uh the and was in close to as bad of fiscal shape as it was now us which was immediately after world war ii u.s real rates went to negative 14 and and the us was the winner of that war we still had a lot of capacity the losers the people who had been de-industrialized by world war ii uh saw negative real rates of negative 20 to negative 60 percent so it's interesting you hear policy makers say we have to fight covet like it's a war it's a war we need to spend like it's a war well the last time is a war reel rates at the losers went to negative 20 to 60 and at the winners they went to negative 14. so to me the biggest investment theme by far is real rates didn't bottom in all likelihood in august of last year at negative one so let's see here as such the following question that is is inflation transient at any given moment it could be if the fed doesn't do enough if fiscal authorities don't do enough however if authorities want to de-lever their balance sheets if they want to avoid a debt crisis no inflation is not in transient it is going to be much more persistent and i think persistently under-measured but persistent from wd best guess on how long financial repression would have to run before real rates could be allowed to rise uh in my opinion the price the the the price target is not something that we're going to measure in time i think it's something that the price target for monetary policy is going to be in in the aftermath of kovid uh the u.s is getting debt to gdp excuse me uh and so we're at 130 percent today i think financial repression and significantly negative real rates will stay that way until we are at 80 percent at the gdp maybe 70 maybe 60 maybe 50. i think it's instructive to look back again to the last time the us fiscal situation was nearly as bad as it is now but really it's much worse now for a number of reasons and that was in the immediate aftermath of world war ii and we saw debt to gdp in the us go from 110 to 50 to 60 in five to six years from 1946 to 1951 and again during that time we saw u.s rio rates of negative 14 persistently negative real rates and so i think ultimately this isn't about inflation this isn't about employment although it's more about employment than inflation it's about delivering the government balance sheet and following whatever policies are needed to do that from wmr why is yield curve control necessary if the us government's funding itself primarily with debt of less than two years in duration additionally if longer-term rates are rising maybe it gives off false signals of higher future growth as opposed to less buyers interested in longer-term treasuries and i i think to me it's really about managing a process because the longer term longer dated treasury particularly the 10-year is a key policy rate for the real economy out there and in particular the housing market and everything tied to the housing markets and certain other real estate markets uh which are a huge part of effectively the collateral that backs the entire banking system of the united states and so i i do agree that uh longer term rates are rising in part due to this supply-demand mismatch we have been highlighting for an extended period of time and i think that will also factor into why uh why they will ultimately they the fed will ultimately be forced into some form of yield curve control i think later this year from df seems like you've swayed from being uber bullish gold to uber bullish bitcoin if so what's led to this change in philosophy i don't think it's it's a switch from one to the other i think it's been just much more of a realization that the structure of bitcoin with its lack of an unallocated bitcoin market like uh the unallocated gold market in london uh the fact that there's no unallocated bitcoin market means that bitcoin can actually function bitcoin to me is just the last functioning smoke detector in a financial asset world where policy makers have largely broken many or most of the others they've broken gold with the unregulated unlimited expansion of paper gold derivatives centered in london they've broken interest rates by the unlimited expansion of central bank balance sheets you can tell those are the key if you may if you if you if you control those um risk-free rate to the capital asset pricing models u.s treasuries if the fed's balance sheet is going to grow to make sure rates are at certain levels then all other asset prices are going to be influenced the release valve will be their balance sheet and by extension you would expect the currency to impact you'd expect gold to go up but instead of gold going up gold derivatives have gone up bitcoin doesn't have those derivatives and so we're seeing bitcoin doing what gold should be doing uh ultimately i think gold is going to do that but increasingly i think gold is going to do that in a very short period of time unfortunately um i had thought maybe they would let it go um it's not being let go uh it's very range-bound um and so i still really like both i uh like i said i when when will they let it go is of course a question it could be tomorrow i wouldn't be surprised it could be five to ten years i wouldn't be surprised and so i think it's important to just kind of own both i mean i am cognizant that if i'm a policy maker and gold's going nowhere as i'm inflating things away i can credibly say look there's no inflation gold's doing nothing and as bitcoin goes to 100 200 000 hundred thousand whatever it's gonna do i can sit there and say oh well bitcoin's a bubble and oh i'm gonna regulate bitcoin next week i'm gonna regulate bitcoin next month i'm gonna regulate bitcoin and just try to sort of uh control it by jawboning which is sort of what seems like what they're doing so that's really it it's not that i have changed my view on gold at all it's just more this practical realization that uh bitcoin's structure is allowing it to move gold is not yet finally outlook for gold for the rest of the year uh i think it's positive you've got real rates i think likely to turn back down i think you've got more stimulus likely to come even beyond what's been announced already and i think you have a call option with the basel three regulations coming in june or excuse me early july i believe in the united states and uh early january in london and again i'm always careful with this because i've seen this sort of uh this is it for the for the unallocated gold market uh dynamic i've seen this a number of different times so i'm very i see any types of announcements regarding that with a big grain of salt with that said to my uh non-legalese trained eyes the basel iii net stable funding ratio regulations as it relates to the gold market does seem do seem to be designed to force a a leverage wind down of the unallocated gold market and as we were just talking about were that to happen were there just regulations on the amount of leverage that could exist in the gold market it'd be a very bullish thing for gold prices because then the price of gold would be the release valve will allow be uh the release valve for those pressures rather than the amount of paper gold derivatives expanding so that's it for

"USD cycle in 1980s v. now, key bottlenecks on USD strength",2023-11-29 18:00:21+00:00,19,PlcIU0mPMS8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlcIU0mPMS8,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fftt hope everybody's well had a great week and i apologize i'm running a few minutes late here i was uh trying to get the last little uh bit of the browns uh touchdown drive uh there so we're we're up nine with ten to play at kansas city so we'll see we we're looking like a pretty good football team this year so that's a that's that's something to be optimistic so hope you had a great weekend i'm going to jump in here speaking of football first questions from my friend brent johnson osu versus oregon what happened um well two things obviously our defense didn't play all that well uh we gave up 250 something yards on the ground which is something you're not going to win a lot of football games doing however as a lot of you know i actually went to the university of cincinnati which is the second biggest school in the state of ohio and we are actually our football team is actually ranked higher than the ohio state buckeyes coming out of this weekend uh for the first time in a long long time so we'll see how long that lasts so there is a silver lining for me there so into the macro stuff first off from dc comments on this uh harold malngren's saying effectively no stimulus is coming um harold knows harold is very tied in gentleman uh i i've had the pleasure of uh the privilege really of meeting him a number of times spending uh a number of hours talking with him uh he's brilliant he's very well tied in he understands the political game he's been in and around washington for 60 plus years um if there is no stimulus coming that's a big problem uh and that is going to put pressure on the fed to qe more if they taper qe into no stimulus and i'm saying a real taper i'm not talking about hey we're going to taper with the left-hander we're going to do standing repo and the the fema swap lines or fima swap lines and reverse repo with the right hand i'm talking about real taper um any lack of enough stimulus or lack of stimulus at all will likely be very good for the dollar it probably be good for treasury bonds in other words yields down at the long end of the curve at least initially it's likely to be very good for volatility and probably bad for just about everything else now if they persist in that situation where the fed continues uh to let global markets twist in the wind then eventually it would actually start to be bad for treasuries like we saw in march of 2020 when you saw yields rise after 12 days of the market being down sharply and it'd probably start to be good for gold uh and bitcoin as well so let's see um if there's no stimulus though that is a that is an important data point following up on that from d.a what is the most important thing to pay attention to for the next six months i think for the next six months it's probably are the fed and treasury going to do quote-unquote enough now what's enough we'll know when we see it because if it's not enough we'll see the dollar rising and a lot of other things falling um but um i think more pressingly in the next six weeks i think the most important things to pay attention to are what we're seeing in supply chains which are getting worse and worse uh and which we continue to hear are likely to be a much longer uh issue uh driving upward pressure on inflation than consensus currently believes and the other thing i think we need to watch for is this what we've been calling this great resignation which is uh these vaccine mandates uh biden raised the ante last week and uh they are making a bet that the a large number of of for a quorum certainly of critical employees and supply chain and in health care etc are not going to resign their jobs uh resign and and go find something else to do and maybe they're right however i think it's to be really critical to watch over the next three to six weeks because if we start to see the job market get worse if we start to see supply chain pressures get worse the vaccine mandate has a possibility of being a stagflationary turbocharger to what's already a stagflationary environment so let's watch and see what happens uh from kw you've spoken before about selling your farm partially to start fftt is a farm something you'd be interested in owning again someday as part of a long hard asset play have you looked into farmland how farmland performed during other times in the history of financial repression and negative real rates uh in short yeah it's absolutely something i would like to own again i owned about 100 acres uh from i think 2011 to 2013 i would have held it longer but i needed to sell the farmland for startup capital for fft because i didn't want to take outside investors so i could have complete creative control to write what i felt like needed to be written and needed to be said uh farmland has tended to correlate with u.s money supply over time broad money supplies lyndon alden my friend lynn alden has actually done some great work around that and so it is a good hedge of currency debasement and the rental rate that you pull off of farmland uh correlates with crop prices on a lag and so it tends to be a true inflation protected uh security if you will you don't have to trust what the government's telling you inflation is you can just look at the price of corn and beans and wheat and say okay rent next year is going to be this and uh that's it and if corn and if all those things go up the year after that you can raise rents i was always very flexible uh with the uh my friend who was a farmer uh i i i i i like the little phrase um you're partnering with your with with your with you with your business partners so when crop prices fell um we cut rents uh and we worked out a deal because it's important it was important to me for the farmer to make uh good money on running the land as much as it was for me to make a nice a nice yield owning the land so the other nice thing about farmland is is that if it's treated properly i think it's crp is the tax program the net of it is was on that hundred acres i was paying like 600 bucks a year in property taxes i don't know if that's still the case that was uh nearly a decade ago now obviously but um philosophically the government does not tax farmland very highly because it just would filter through into higher food prices which as we know uh food inflation triggers political unrest so uh that's the reason for that so uh next question from mv can a focus on public sector deaths excluding households and businesses be misleading for example rogue art and rogue off and reinhardt excuse me and this time is different for only focus on government debts where and the the two the u.s government debt is often compared with 1945 but in 1945 businesses and households were in better shape back then um i i guess it would it could be from the standpoint that if you're only looking at the federal government debt but the household business sector is also very levered then i do think it actually is misleading from the standpoint that um that you actually are in much worse fiscal shape because the household business sector uh can't offset what's going on in the in the federal government sector uh ultimately it's supply it means that um real rates to get out of that situation probably would need to be even more negative so households and businesses are highly levered now whereas they weren't during world war ii the federal government now is more levered than it was during world war ii after world war ii u.s real rates had to go to negative 14 uh to help get out of basically to financially repress earn our way out of the uh the uh they help the government deliver their their debt to gdp from call it 110 percent to about 55 percent over a five year time frame real rates are widely considered to have bottomed uh at about 1.1 negative 1.1 negative 1.2 either in august of last year or a little bit earlier this year um ultimately if you've got debt at the household and business sector as well it suggests it would have to get even more negative than that so the other thing i think that's that's interesting within that as a side note is there's an old theory or old saw uh in in credit ratings that no company or private organization within a sovereign can have a higher credit rating at least sustainably than the sovereign so you in other words a corporation can't be triple a rated in america if the u.s government's only double a-rated uh and that makes sense because ultimately if you're a triple-a rated corporation in the us government's double a they can always tax that corporation more to make ends meet uh whereas the the reverse is not true for the uh for the corporation uh so that's just sort of an interesting side note uh and then last but not least we received multiple questions about uranium uh and just talking about it we talked about it probably for one of the first times in last week's tree rings uh i am a newbie to the space so take this with a block of salt but i'm not a newbie to the energy side in particular particularly excuse me a theme we've been talking about for um a number of uh really uh well over a year uh peak cheap oil coming back which is that that looks increasingly like there is a um fossil fuel supply problem uh that is getting worse uh and the general gist of it is that uh if you look at global oil supplies they haven't risen much since 2005 if you x out u.s shale you've got some depletion rates some some for example there's a giant uh gas field in europe uh uh groningen i believe is the name i think it is in the netherlands uh and it is being shut down more rapidly than thought uh and so you're running into or would know not only no longer just peak cheap oil you're starting to have gas uh crunches in europe in the uk in california um you basically you're starting to run into this situation where narratives around green are running into reality of energy demand being infinite and some of the conveniences around it so california is getting permission to turn natural gas turbines back on because as much as they want to be green voters don't like when they're freezing in the dark or when they have to take cold showers so i think it's an interesting theme as it relates back to uranium because ultimately you're looking at turning gas turbines back on you're looking at peak cheap oil you're looking at coal being burned in increasing amounts or lately because again everybody wants to be green until they have to freeze in the dark and when you freeze when you have your constituents freezing in the dark you don't get reelected so it's i think like i said i'm a very much a newbie to the uranium side there looks to be some very structural positive uh demand drivers to it i have not looked into the supply side at all i know sprott's doing something with an etf where they're buying up a lot of supply i do know what's i've paid a lot of attention what's happening on the fossil fuel supply side along with the demand side and from that side of it um it seems like uh it seems like it could be a really good environment for uranium from a structural standpoint so with that i'm going to sign off for tonight i paused the browns game so no spoiler alerts please i'm hoping we're gonna be able to pull it out for our first week one win since 04. in the meantime if you like these updates uh we are running a promotion check out tree rings uh we're running a promotion on trainings fft treerings.com you can find out more about the promotion

[applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everyone luke groman fftt hope everybody is well and had a great weekend uh before i jump into this week's uh edition wanted to give a quick shout out to mary chapman uh tree ring subscriber and uh finally got to meet her uh face to face uh last week and unfortunately uh at the sad circumstances at the uh the funeral of a dear friend of both of ours uh father uh but it's great catching up with you mary very nice to meet you in person so with that i'm gonna jump right in um first questions from hyanni any warning signs to look for the next fed pivot will they even disclose if they don't shrink the balance sheet and just keep printing your respective of rates in my opinion the warning signs will come from debt markets fi if issuance uh begins to dry up basically if markets get too volatile issuance begins to dry up that'll be one warning sign i think volatility and equity markets another warning sign and we've started to see that a bit of course with equities selling off volatility rising and i think the biggest one as we've talked about before is is u.s treasury market liquidity or illiquidity as it were you've already had some tremors in in volatility you've had tremors in u.s treasury uh illiquidity we wrote about that a little bit last week not a lot but a little bit you've also had i'm told a little bit a little bit of ill liquidity or a little bit of softness in debt market issuance in the last week or two nothing huge yet but something to keep an eye on as a signpost so uh i think the last one would probably be the yield curve if you get a yield curve in version that i think will be another big warning sign so those are the things i'm watching um along with the dollar and some other things in terms of the the big ones at least in terms of when we start thinking about timing of a potential fed reversal or relenting on on their tightening program from laura any chance the u.s is the sovereign you mentioned your friday letter that's secretly buying gold i was highlighting a uh uh report or an article in bloomberg by eddie vanderveld talking about a gold a sovereign whale buying gold every time it falls below hundred dollars per ounce over the last year year and a half um and laura then goes on to ask if you can freely print money doesn't it make sense to secretly accumulate gold with printed money till the jig is up to me it's possible uh it would make sense i agree with you on that however in my opinion it's unlikely just the risk is that if word got out that the united states government was buying gold number one from a policy standpoint the people in washington many of the policy makers in washington at treasury etc are so dogmatic about the dollar uh ditto the fed i just think that it's it's it's like a religion for them they're not gonna they're not gonna do that even though it's probably the smart thing to do given the fiscal situation uh in my opinion uh more likely that sovereign in question in the bloomberg article uh was was russia or china and obviously we've seen those trends over the last decade or so from bruno what are your thoughts about long treasuries uh the the the long treasury uh the bond curve steepening which is desired promoted by the fed against the current need although not quite possible to hike short rates i i they need the long end of the curve to rise as as much as possible uh so that they can hike rates without inviting inverting the curve excuse me uh but they can't let the long end rise so much that it begins to hurt the real economy because really the long the 10-year treasury is really the policy rate for a lot of the the real economy uh through the housing link um consumer lending link uh more broadly um and so uh you're already seeing the economy slow a bit per the atlanta fed's data uh other data in theory uh the fed can manage the curve by selling off part of the long you know long bonds that they own uh and in theory uh steep in the curve in that fashion and they might even try to uh and it would probably work given some of the treasury market liquidity just talked about them a second ago all of this implies that the fed can judge uh both the non-recessionary level of long-dated treasury yields uh on a lag um ahead of time uh and what the economy is doing in real time uh better than the bond market and the yield curve can judge that and in my opinion uh both of those are are pretty tough asks of the fed so we'll see but in theory they could they have some flexibility to manage the long end based on the fact that they own own bonds that they can sell into a an increasingly illiquid at least relative to history uh treasury market from pm how can inflation possibly persist into the summer when qe is ending rates are already up stimulus checks have likely run out supply chains are improving and base effects are in place well base effects were in place in the second half of last year too and that didn't help so we'll we'll take the last one first i think supply chains are probably the key swing factor to watch they are improving uh seasonally in particular um they're always really busy in 4q and not so busy in one queue just given the consumer heavy nature of america consumer-spending nature of america and gdp so it is definitely improvement uh particularly in the last several weeks i i'm we'll see if it continues to improve inflation at this point i think depends very heavily on that continued improvement uh supply chains depend very heavily on china and i think china and how well they play along depend in no small part on how much the state department the u.s state department keeps picking a fight with china um every time that you know something i've been watching every time we hear the state department talk about xinjiang rightly or wrongly you get or taiwan you got to believe that that there's going to be some sort of retaliation and one of the easiest ways one of the most plausible and plausibly deniable ways for retaliation for china is to figure out a way to just delay the improvement in supply chains um whoops we found two coveted cases in ningbo gotta short the short the uh shut the port down for two weeks that's gonna back everything up shutting a port for two weeks gonna back up things for two three four months so uh given that given the the elaborate nature supply chain so long-winded way of saying is is supply chains will improve as long as china doesn't weaponize them and and state department is giving china a lot of excuse to weaponize them we can agree disagree but it's a weapon china can use particularly knowing that stagflation is the fed's worst nightmare right now and so weaponizing supply chains will be a very effective weapon against the fed against the biden administration the last thing they need for midterms is stagflation now if the economy goes into recession uh yeah you're likely to get inflation to roll over but that's going to create a whole new set of problems that still very few people are talking about you're going to have debt market problems you're going to have western sovereign debt market problems in a sustained recession and uh western sovereign debt will be at risk of nominal default including treasury bonds in a sustained recession and so i think it is highly unlikely that we will see western sovereign debt put at risk of nominal uh default and instead what we will see is western central banks reverse course begin buying more of the sovereign debt uh uh re-upping qe in order to maintain the nominal solvency of of western sovereign debt and i think as the public particularly the next iteration of this movie whether it happens in two months whether it happens in six months whether it happens in a year i would take the under on a year but the as the public sees this now that the public has seen a seven and a half percent cpi print we're into a very dangerous part of the game for the fed which is the next time they have to relent people are going to start factoring that into their business models into their into their mindset okay the last time the fed did this we did end up getting inflation let's raise prices let's get ahead of it this time so it could really begin to feed on itself which is i think the fed's worst nightmare but uh ultimately if they didn't want this problem um we shouldn't have done what we did economically we shouldn't have issued all the debt we shouldn't have gone to war in the middle east we these are mistakes while in the short run have no cost the debt in the short run has no cost in the long run it always has a cost and it's very steep i and i think regarding the um the mindset getting set i think policymakers know this i think they know that that and that's why they're getting so so panic stricken about inflation in the last several months from dm kathy woods says when china catches a cold commodities catch the flu she believes the housing bubble in china is bursting please explain why you believe this won't crash commodities it could it could that said what kathy and what most of the rest of wall street are missing which is something i just alluded to is that china catching catching a cold and giving commodities the flu will also put the global economy into a recession and it's gonna put sovereign debt in particular western sovereign debt at risk of defaulting as in your coupon payment for uh german boons u.s treasury bonds is not coming this month we don't have the tax receipts i don't think that's going to happen i think given the choice between that and and fed we need you to print the difference the answer will be fed we need you to print the difference fed prints the difference and so um to me this bigger metadynamic if you will is likely to provide i'm not saying there's no downside to commodities but i think it's going to provide a floor on a structural secular basis over this cycle for commodities for industrials for gold for bitcoin uh in my opinion you know i think it's important to recognize uh or remember i think it was mark fober who said unemployment was 95 in zimbabwe when they hyperinflated and so there's this mindset that you know we can't have high rates of inflation unless we have high rates or low rates of unemployment or if we and that's just not true once you get to high levels of sovereign debt things start to get a little weird now i don't think the united states or any western sovereign is going to become zimbabwe that's not my point my point is extremes inform the means and the united states had uh currency depreciation induced inflation throughout the 1970s and i think that's where we're headed again and so that's where i think kathy's wrong on this and much of wall street they're just not factoring in where we are in the long cycle in terms of u.s debt in particular u.s deficits in particular given that the united states is the center of the system sovereigns aren't going to let themselves default and and if things roll over toward recession that puts all of them at risk of default from patrick johnson luke very happy fft subscriber here thank you very much patrick appreciate your business uh in your opinion what's your preferred vehicles for gold exposure coins gold miner politically friendly countries gld fizz for me personally i like physical bullion coins held out of the system so private vaulting a number of cities have them around you have to look into it a little bit so i don't know what's in your particular city um uh i prefer gold eagles and canadian maple leafs i also think miners in politically friendly uh climates and which is to say uh us canada and i just caught myself there this is the risk of minors right the the ultimately the risk of minors we have this long-standing tradition of political uh friendliness in the anglo-american countries um did what did what trudeau just did last week changed that as it relates to gold miners i don't know but i do know i have to actually think about that for the first time and so i'm not saying i dislike canadian miner anyway all i'm saying is the political situation can change rapidly it is appearing to change rapidly possibly so let's just pay attention right let's watch um so like i said holding physical gold coins out of the system doesn't matter what trudeau is trudeau does or anybody else so i think that's um you know that's i think critical to watch you know how what does all that mean look if if we go back to some sort of gold revaluation is it possible that the trudeau administration would say listen gold miners you're gonna get the first five thousand dollars per ounce of upside and anything after that we're gonna take yeah absolutely now will gold miners be happy if uh from a financial standpoint if that's how it were to play out yeah they're gonna the dividends on gold miners at that point will be bigger than the share price today in all likelihood or close to it right so they're gonna be just fine uh but what it would point to is that gold miners in my opinion gold miners in the western countries may not be the most levered way to play at this cycle because we're at the end of a sovereign debt cycle which was not the case in the 1970s so it's just something to think about i don't not telling people to go out and sell all their gold miners anything like that i just think when you start seeing things like we just saw in canada in the last two weeks you have to think about sovereign risk in a way that maybe you hadn't before i know i am let's see here jesse hi luke can you please elaborate on what a revaluing of the dollar price of gold would look like and how it would work exactly if you can comment on the potential geopolitical implications of such a move that would also be greatly appreciated so the mechanics are actually straightforward and provided for in the fed operating manual um it's online uh treasury instructs fed to revalue gold fed revalues gold higher effectively using the printing press uh doing so creates a deposit in the treasury general account at the fed for the u.s treasury uh and so 261 million ounces uh means that roughly every four thousand dollars in gold's price puts a trillion dollars free and clear into the treasury's account that they can spend however they see fit directly into the economy without an offsetting increase in the us debt so just for round math 40 000 an ounce 10 trillion spend 10 trillion in the economy and infrastructure and education whatever you want to do hopefully they use it productively good luck um but um 10 trillion dollars into a 22 trillion dollar economy you're growing gdp by 40 there's no debt increasing on the other side um you're going to have a significant delivering of the u.s government's balance sheet and at that point the fed can then normalize interest rates without blowing up the system so mechanically that's how it work from a geopolitical standpoint um it would be enormous you would basically be the us government de facto admitting uh or transitioning to the system that russia china europe uh basically all of eurasia has been moving toward for the last 20 years really since the launch of the euro which is gold is the primary reserve asset not treasuries anymore and what that would mean is is that um basically either the us government would have to shrink itself or the fed would have to print the difference and if the fed prints the difference um then you're gonna have inflation you're gonna have the dollar not be the strongest or the the cleanest dirty shirt it's gonna be the dirtiest dirty shirt because we have the biggest deficits for our central bank to finance relative to any other deficit so uh the short version is as you would have it would basically be a de facto change in the global currency system it would be a restructuring of global reserve status uh a reserve system the dollar would still be a reserve currency but the primary reserve asset would be gold not dollars i in short i think you would have the biggest global economic boom in 80 years since after the aftermath of world war ii and broad strokes the nations that have been driving consumption like the u.s would see big increases in domestic production reassuring because the currency would fall would make it attractive to do that they would need to do that uh and vice versa the those that have been driving a lot of production the chinese in particular to a lesser extent the japanese and the germans would have to consume more um their currencies would rise against the dollar their products would get less competitive versus the us's so it's that's sort of the big thrusts and then you can sort of take it a whole a lot longer than that but i'll pause there i'll stop there those would be the implications uh let's see uh from bc how could the cayman islands be one of the biggest buyers of treasuries is it tether or someone else yeah the cayman islands population 62 000 it now owns oh god hundreds of billions of treasuries i want to say over 200 billion dollars in treasuries and they're i think the sixth largest credit foreign credit of the united states how's that happen it's hedge funds uh uh caymans are a proxy for hedge funds uh and that raises an important contextual point that again most investors on wall street are just ignoring because they haven't had to think about who and how the us deficits are financed for 50 years the us has gone from the biggest marginal buyer of treasury's biggest marginal foreign buyer of treasuries being foreign central banks in 2014 which is a very stable creditor uh then after 2014 when foreign central banks basically stopped growing their holdings of treasuries it moved to the global private sector right so you're talking about japanese german insurers and pension funds not quite as stable as central banks in terms of credit but still really stable now the biggest marginal buyers of uh treasuries on the foreign side according to the us treasury's own holders foreign foreign holders of treasuries report luxembourg ireland cayman uk switzerland right so i called them the ulix uk luxembourg ireland cayman switzerland so the uk they're a twin deficit nation they're not recycling surpluses with the us into treasuries they're twin deficits they don't have surpluses so that's a financial aid sector luxembourg tax haven uh ireland tax haven caymans hedge funds tax havens switzerland funds and tax havens so you basically the u.s government is increasingly financing itself more and more at shorter and shorter durations um over the last several years they've actually raised the duration a bit in the last uh four to six months uh but with increasingly fickle creditors uh and what this means is hedge funds don't care about politics they don't care about correlative currency stability they want to make money and so for whatever reason they stop making money on their treasuries they sell uh this is very different than central banks were holding treasuries where there were politics relative currency values that they came into place trade surpluses a whole lot more that made them much more stable basically what it translates to is the treasury market's going to be more volatile than it ever was every time we have a market sell-off a crisis because hedge funds are going to be selling a lot and they're now a big part of the financing of the us government what that then means is the treasury or the fed's probably going to have to step in much sooner in crisis to continue to allow the treasury market to function properly and if you recall treasury markets started seeing dysfunction in march of 2020 and and we've written about the fed's um shadow third mandate maintaining treasury market functioning okay couple more here michael do you believe that bank accounts across the west will be shut off in response to dissenting views i'd like to say no uh emphatically um but i can't uh i think what happened in canada last week if it hasn't gotten your attention it should uh as an investor i quite frankly for my wealth i am far more interested in what's happening in canada uh particularly vis-a-vis the banking system than i am in ukraine i you know i remember taking my shoes off at the airport in 2005 or four or six or whatever that was going to be temporary too um it wasn't temporary so the one thing i will say without getting too political here central bank digital currencies will facilitate this dynamic tremendously where you tweet something wrong you you know you have wrong think to use a 1984 term um or to make up my own central bank digital currencies will make it much easier for the financial system to be weaponized against its own citizens and so i'll stop there uh from mark mcguire odds of russia going into ukraine odds of recession this year i'm not the right guy to talk to on russia and ukraine um the only thing i will say is i don't know why putin would do so uh he's winning uh he's been fighting to have nordstrom 2 into germany for 20 years it's basically done they're about to turn it on uh the u.s has said we will sanction nordstrom 2 if uh they go in um my view that's euro denominated energy gets europe away from the dollar it gets uh uh for their energy bill it gets russia further away from the dollar in their energy uh exports and so i just don't know why he'd push it but you know we'll see odds of recession i think depend very much on if the fed actually hikes and sells bonds or not if they don't then i think the odds of recession are pretty low i think if they do the odds of recession are pretty high and so i think that's why it's really key to watch will they and and watch for those signals we talked about earlier about whether or if when they might relent all right last two eg what's the status of basel iii net stable funding ratio regarding gold there was a sense that by january 22 there would be some uncertainty with the implementation i haven't heard anybody anything about it for some time nothing burger is it a nothing burger backing up net stable funding ratio for gold and basel basically uh was enforcing uh seemed to be codifying the wind down of the unallocated gold market in london it was making it more expensive unattractive economically for london banks to hold large amounts of unallocated gold as opposed to physical on physical and allocated gold amounts and so you wind down the gold leverage uh it ultimately should start showing up in gold's price uh in other words instead of leverage rising in london uh and gold price not rising uh leverage stops rising in london gold's price rises the language within that and that stable funding ratio was watered down last july with that said i don't want to make too much at last five or six weeks but uh gold has been remarkably resilient in the face of rising real rates rising uh nominal rates uh given what real rates have done gold could easily be three four five hundred dollars lower than where it is today probably should be but isn't in fact it's up and so directionally even with the watered-down language the same dynamics seem to be in place i don't want to make too much of it but i think it's very noteworthy the gold's not collapsing under this rising rate so let's see if it continues but i think that may actually be a sign that this net stable funding ratio thing is actually having a positive impact on the gold price so let's watch and see and then the last question from tj what would you rather get paid in a bitcoin b gold see a gold back currency why uh i'd rather get paid in dollars um i i get paid in dollars then i can pay what i have to in taxes without having to convert back into dollars i can pay my interest payments on uh investments uh property etc in dollars uh and then i can convert the rest into gold bitcoin industrial commodity equities and real estate as i see fit so it's for me it's just about the the liquidity and i think it's really where you're seeing the system evolve to right you get the currency you get paid and i won't say it doesn't matter but it kind of doesn't matter it's where you store any surpluses you generate and i think the system as i talked about before is has been evolving for much of the last decade from a system where you store your surpluses and treasury bonds to storing your surpluses in gold bitcoin equities real estate uh because sovereigns cannot abide positive real interest rates um they will go broke under real interest rates given their debt loads and storing your wealth uh sovereign debt that has a negative real interest rate uh only a fool would do that and i'm not a fool and neither are you so with that said uh thank you everyone for joining we ran a little long today appreciate you

[applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope everybody is well uh we are hunkering in here for this uh so far this year's edition of the storm of the century so hope everybody's staying warm staying safe out there uh i know we are certainly doing so hope you had a great long weekend so with that out of the way let's jump into the questions first we've got uh what i would say is the most important question from klt who are the browns drafting and a follow-up what percentage chance do we have a win in the 2020 2022 super bowl so for me i think the browns need to be drafting a very athletic linebacker uh to spy lamar jackson since we have to play him twice a year for the foreseeable future also think we need another shutdown corner to go along with ward if we do that i think we'll be very competitive i don't want to say we're going to be in the super bowl uh but i do think we'll be competitive again this year so it'll be another year of fun browns football so with that let's get to the the the macro and and the economic stuff uh from np am i a buyer of bitcoin at today's prices uh yes uh i continue to like bitcoin uh even here uh with the caveat that it is very volatile and is likely to remain very volatile secondly from ai any concerns about the near to medium turnover the next few months as it pertains to this reflationary cycle is it vulnerable and also any concerns the fed chooses not to accommodate the rising fiscal spending and reacts by tightening uh the short answer is yes i i do think uh it is vulnerable really at any time uh simply uh by virtue of uh whatever the fed does and and really i think it depends on the net impact of the two treasury general account or tga rundown that we're seeing that's supposed to happen pretty aggressively over the next uh five months it's supposed to run down from call it a trillion five to i want to say 500 billion or or even less over the next so there's a lot of dollar liquidity being injected by that that will uh all else equal be inflationary put downward pressure on the dollar against that you have to net what the fed is doing uh in terms of buying enough treasuries in 2022 they bought enough treasuries uh the fourth quarter 2020 they really stopped buying quote unquote enough and that represents tightening so if you have the expansionary fiscal with not enough fed buying and no tga you're going to be running effectively brent johnson's milkshake uh you're going to have stronger dollar capital flows here rates up stocks up for a while till something breaks uh the net against that is what the key is what's the tga do and if the tga is being run down in a big way i think we're going to be okay on the reflationary side but it is definitely something that is fragile depending on what the fed does and if the fed is doing enough at any given moment relative uh or net of whatever the tga is doing from david regarding the latest interview with russell napier on real vision he shares your view on yield curve control and financial repression he differs on the question of central bank balance sheet expansion to soak up the government debt any update on your views uh i've not had a chance to read that yet uh so i'm or watch it yet so i'm not sure how we differ in terms of soaking up the government debt uh my view is essentially that that the fed's been basically married to the treasury and uh that means that increasingly going forward the key metric to watch for inflation is going to be uh not private bank private uh sector bank loans but rather uh bank loans to the us government in other words u.s deficits and the rate at which the u.s banking system buys treasuries last year banking system treasury purchases were up uh 20 plus year-over-year so quite robust uh i think they're now getting to a size where on a net basis you really start to see that impact but the key is that basically means the us government's in charge of inflationary pressures increasingly going forward not the private banking sector as has been the case for the past 40 years so let's watch that uh from matt thoughts on ubi or helicopter money as a masked attempt at a soft default on debt via inflation but framed politically as taking care of the people i i think that's essentially what's begun and i think covet is a very very politically useful cover to do that and that's not to say covet is some big conspiracy theory i just think that it is politically difficult if not impossible for anybody in washington to stand up and be a deficit hawk for as long as we have the coveted political cover that we're doing this to uh to build back better to use uh president biden's words and so i think that's already begun i think it began last year i think it will continue in fits and starts as different political um concerns about uh um the size of spending like we saw in the second half of last year weigh on it but ultimately i think that's i think we have begun down that road and i don't think we're gonna stop going down that road uh for the foreseeable future uh from kh what where are you at with the bitcoin versus gold conversation i i like them both still um i think they're both neutral reserve assets uh i think bitcoin is better on a lot of metrics than gold in terms of being what gold uh has historically been gold for with that said i still think there are two things that gold does better than bitcoin and makes it every bit as important to hold in my view which is uh bit gold gold is final settlement in other words gold you hold a gold coin it's final payment it's final settlement there is no energy debt owed to that gold coin or that gold bar in contrast you hold a bitcoin there is an ongoing energy debt that must always be paid via the electricity via the network that supports the value of that bitcoin the other thing is that the uh is that bitcoin is not on central bank or sovereign balance sheets and gold is and so if there comes a moment where there needs to be a binary resetting of the system the only asset uh really available to authorities is gold not bitcoin so uh continue to like them both though from wd please explain in contrast to gold i've concluded that far from wanting to ban bitcoin key us authorities now see it as a positive and maybe even critical for the us and the dollar for bitcoin to rise to very high prices though i touched on this in in my interview my real vision interview with ed harrison uh two weeks ago and uh it was he asked me about what i thought about mike green's recent uh conversation with pomp on real vision uh regarding bitcoin and my point is that there are people that are aware there are people in washington and particularly in the defense and intelligence establishment that are aware that the euro dollar system is being used by the chinese against the u.s so in other words right now what's happening is uh china borrows dollars they lend those dollars out at a spread along the belton road they use uh those dollars to secure uh they lend those dollars against hard asset collateral and that's uh that builds chinese political clout geopolitical clout uh economic clout and that then creates a dependency on emerging markets on china now if the dollar gets too strong the weaker of the more those emerging markets one of two things happens if those emerging the weaker of those emerging markets start to default on those chinese dollar loans number one china gets the hard asset collateral which is what they wanted in the first place so china wins or in theory what we've seen in fact the fed comes in and supplies swap dollar swap lines to the weaker emerging markets to prevent a dollar contagion thereby making china whole on their dollar loans so you've got china borrowing dollars lending them at a spread to gain political and geopolitical and economic clout uh to emerging markets to secure resources and these loans are being backstopped by the fed under the auspices of the fed having to backstop the euro dollar system all of this is to basically keep the dollar stronger than it would otherwise be and all of that is hollowing out u.s manufacturing as it happens and sort of as as i put it in the real vision interview the the cherry on top of this incredible sunday is that the u.s military defends the trade lanes to allow china to bring these hard assets and finite commodities back to china so my point here is a long-winded way of background is saying there are parties in washington that understand how the existing euro dollar system is being used to strip the united states of its hit hegemony paradoxically and if you understand this paradox then you would not see as negative an asset that begins to put pressure on the existing euro dollar system like bitcoin will eventually do if it continues to do what it's doing and if it does with some of the bitcoin uh the most uh vocal bitcoin proponents think it will do and which i think it has a legit shot of doing so that's why i think ultimately there are some interests that in in in washington that i think are rooting for uh bitcoin to to do very very well because ultimately it would put pressure on the dollar putting pressure on the dollar would allow the us to basically take the dollar down to a level that would reassure we'd we'd be able to re-strengthen re-shore supply chains that we can't with the dollar current valuations with the euro dollar system as currently structured and then finally from bc why don't you call bitcoin a bubble uh because the bubble is sovereign debt and by extension uh fiat currencies um if i look at bitcoin in particular i'm not talking about all cryptos i'm talking about bitcoin we have a finite issuance okay so we got 20 million uh 21 million bitcoins someday uh zero percent yielding my alternative is uh the u.s uh cbo says that the us is going to run between one and two trillion dollars in deficits every year for the next nine years through 2030 and that assumes no recessions no wars no other pandemics everything goes swimmingly one to two trillion a year more every year in treasury issuance and those treasuries are also uh de facto particularly at the short end yielding zero so i can own an asset that is is finite in issuance yielding zero or i can own an asset that is infinite an issuance basically yielding zero i would rather own the uh i would rather on the finite asset and the the other issue and why i say the sovereign debts the bubble is debt levels in the u.s in western sovereigns around the world more broadly uh as well as corporate debt levels as well as uh consumer debt levels are so high but in particularly for the sovereigns they're so high that these sovereigns cannot afford to pay a market rate of interest they have to pay they have to have their central banks uh keep real interest rates negative for them to not nominally default on their on their tr on their sovereign debt or their entitlement promises and uh if that's the case once again i would rather have a zero percent yielding bearer asset with finite issuance than an infinite issuance zero percent and real realistically a negative real rate uh bond whose face value can't rise to compensate me for those negative real rates unlike a bitcoin whose face value as we've seen can absolutely rise to compensate me and protect my purchasing power during the period of negative rates that all governments especially western governments especially the us need just to keep the wheels on the cart uh for the foreseeable future so uh to me the bubble is uh sovereign debt uh not bitcoin it's not stocks it's not real estate it's sovereign debt and by extension it's the currencies because uh sovereigns aren't going to go bankrupt they'll print everything they need to keep themselves from going nominally bankrupt so that's it for tonight as always thank you for joining me if you're interested and like these kind of updates

JPY weakness implications for markets; Could gold drop to $1800? (yes IMO),2023-09-28 16:00:19+00:00,16,QVZ1Ctv5I1A,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVZ1Ctv5I1A,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hey everybody luke groman fftt hope everybody had a great weekend uh and i know we had a pretty nice sunny weekend it warmed up a little bit uh so got out a little bit which is always enjoyable so hey with that we're gonna jump right in to the questions thank you very much for joining uh joining me this evening uh the first question is from jc what are your thoughts on rate hikes how many and across what date range until they go back to easing in my opinion the fed i think they'll i think they're definitely gonna do one in march uh if that doesn't really uh get uh get things going pear-shaped and i think they'll get a second at the uh whenever the next uh opportunity is whether it's april or may i i i i forget off the top my head but i don't think they're gonna do more than two before they have to basically pause and then probably start uh moving towards reversing it uh the next question from minervis do you think that some countries can pull let inflation run hot better than others and perhaps it is only the u.s that can really pull it off in many angles anglo-sphere countries housing inflation is already destroying the middle and lower classes is it less likely to succeed outside the u.s it's a great question probably yeah i think that's i think that's a probably a fair assessment i think those that have more diversified economies and bigger economies and those that have a substantial amount of commodity production and or exports can probably weather it better better so for example i would think the us can weather it better than the uk the u.s can weather it better than the eu i don't think or excuse me the u.s can probably weather or can weather it better than japan i think i don't think the u.s will necessarily weather it better than say russia uh so but i think that's i think it's a very valid point uh from h can you elaborate on how the on how the price of oil in non-dollar terms or in dollar terms excuse me would be affected by a china-russia oil deal denominated in a non-dollar currency uh it's a complex topic i could go on for quite some time but i think it's the easiest way to think of it is in terms of balance of payments so if the eu or china for example don't need dollars to buy energy they can print euro they can print you on to buy energy then that frees up dollars for other use for them and that makes a dollar shortage or a currency crisis in either case much less likely it gives china in particular another leverage with with which to manage their uh the one dollar relationship in other words historically a yuan dollar they to manage that ratio they had to do one of two things either slow their economy or sell fx reserves or buy fx reserves uh basically engage in buying treasuries or selling treasuries to manage that rate this you on uh buying oil and yuan even on the margin they don't have to buy most of it you want then they're not they're just on the margin if they buy oil and you want it gives them the ability to manage the one dollar cross rate through oil markets basically this month we want to buy a certain percent in yuan and we want to buy a certain percent in dollars and it can increase effectively synthetically uh the amount of dollars they have coming in uh which then gives them an ability to manage the one dollar cross rate so uh it makes china and the eu's current accounts much more sustainable and stable over time now for russia i think the right way to think about it is like selling your house if you were selling your house and you only had one buyer the buyer has all the power if you have multiple uh buyers uh then the seller has the power it can go with the best bid similarly if oil is only priced in dollars then the russia and their oil production is effectively a subsidiary of the us government and the fed but if it is priced in multiple currencies then russia can sell uh amongst basically multiple bidders different currencies whichever currency is the best it forces the dollar to actually compete on its merits uh and against creditor countries it doesn't compete so well and what i mean by that is you need a certain amount of dollars to pay your debt granted but after that the americans don't make anything on net and so you can sell seven euros and you can get german mercedes benzes you can get airbuses you can get uh etc uh same with china you can buy huawei 5g equipment etc for the americans we do some software we do some weapons and certainly that has been a big one uh but you know we do boeing aircraft but on net uh we're in that debtor and and so the way to think about as it relates back to the dollar uh the dollar price of oil question i think is ultimately if you start pricing oil in multiple currencies it's going to start to move this the the global currencies towards trading based on their balance of payments based on their current accounts those with the biggest current account surplus should rise over time those with the biggest current account deficits should fall over time so euro yuan yen should rise against dollar sterling and and and pound sterling if we just broke it down in the str basket so at any given moment in time i again it would depend i don't think of it as hey it means the dollar price of oil is going to go up over time it should make the dollar price of oil go up any given day it's going to depend i think it's more better to think about as a management tool for balance of payments and for maximizing dollar flows for nations and regions such as uh that import oil but export on net like uh china europe and and probably eventually japan uh let's see from george faber is china's debt to gdp strong enough to become the re reserve currency over the next decade as ray dalio sees it will reserve currencies just be regionalized or will there be a surprise move to a neutral asset such as bitcoin over a 10-year time frame another great question in my opinion a mistake that many westerners make is thinking that china wants a system like the post 1971 dollar system in my opinion they don't uh because that would require them to hollow out their manufacturing base which would be very politically unpopular there it would require them to send the military abroad which with single child policy would be very unpopular there politically and it would require them to run up foreign debt and give foreigners increasing stakes in their domestic industry as china now has in ours and that too would be very politically unpopular in china and and so none of these things china wants to do and so i don't think they want this but away from what i think they want let's watch what they're doing they are setting up a system where they are trying to be able to price uh commodities in their own currency since that's their biggest import item by far the biggest dollar outflow by far is commodities so if they can switch that to yuan over time it gives them tremendous flexibility it basically rules out their ability to have a late 90s like asia currency crisis um and and it's quite frankly in my view the reason kyle bass got the shorting yuan wrong was because uh yuan oil was successful it has not gone away it's still there small part of the market but it only has to be a small part of the market but anyway back to the question uh i think what china what we're watching china do price commodities in yuan uh settle those yuan to to um those that want it in chinese goods and then open up china's capital account on a limited basis uh basically make the yuan convertible on a limited basis through two things oil and gold at a floating rate and you want and so i think that when you look at what china's doing and then you look at russia's fx reserves where it is 13 yuan 25 euro 22 gold um i want to say 15 dollars 20 dollars up that i think is where the world is going multilateral like you said regional reserve currencies if you will i think ultimately nations will reserve currencies um based on their trade flows right if you do a lot of business with the americans you're gonna have a lot of dollars if you don't if you do a lot with the euros and none with the americans you're gonna have a lot of euros and barely any dollars and so i think that's where all this goes and ultimately as it said before that's a system where relative currency values will increasingly be set by balance of payments and the united states is the dirtiest dirty shirt by far because we ran twin deficits forever and so um that is i think ultimately what china wants what russia wants what europe wants it's not what the americans want or at least the americans in washington it'd be really good for america actually but it'd be really inflationary uh wall street wouldn't like it either because it's not good for the bond market you know i would i guess i would lastly say could bitcoin serve that role yeah i think bitcoin could serve that role gold looks like it's serving that role at the moment uh bitcoin i think could do it in a lot of ways better than than than gold i think bitcoin the us did it preemptively uh it could be a huge trump card we could play in the ongoing global geopolitical competition uh i'd like to think our policy makers were that forward thinking um there are people working on it but i'm not optimistic that we're anywhere near that at this point uh either using gold or bitcoin uh let's see from sr is the bond flipping happening in light of an apparent exodus by marginal players in the nascent 30 percent gain in bitcoin is bitcoin about to become the primary de facto risk off asset uh is it about to happen in my opinion no um and it's we're what three four days into this this bitcoin rally so i don't wanna i don't wanna play five-minute macro with that said um i think it's i i think it is showing i think it is very interesting to see bitcoin bouncing as hard as it is with interest rates rising as fast as they are with negative interest rate debt falling as fast as it is negative interest rate debt globally uh i think fell 70 percent in the last five weeks uh 50 last week alone and bitcoins rising so i think there's i've long been saying i think bitcoin is not a bubble bitcoin is just the last functioning free market the last functioning smoke detector that policy makers have not been able to disable so maybe it's just a contra rally and it's going to go right back or maybe it's again suggesting like it was suggesting in in early december like holy cow liquidity is getting taken out of the system and obviously we saw a month and a half two-month stretch of high volatility bond market sell-off stock sell-off etc uh after bitcoin fell are we now seeing is bitcoin now serving as a uh early warning of of uh that the next marginal move by central planners will be more liquidity i think it might be but let's watch and see bond flipping and just for uh the uninitiated the flipping is a uh a bitcoiner term that is about when bitcoin as a market cap gets bigger than um whatever it's against right so silver flipping gold flipping etc right it hasn't flipped gold yet it slipped silver it flipped others uh do i think the bond flipping is here no i mean the bond market's 150 trillion dollars uh um bitcoin is whatever 800 billion now with that said do i think that that 150 trillion dollar bond market is the uh is the rocket fuel for bitcoin absolutely absolutely i think we are in a global sovereign debt bubble for the first time in 100 years i think it's bursting and i think rather than saying bitcoin being a de facto uh risk-free asset i think it's a neutral reserve asset at a time when global central planners are going to have to increasingly fully reserve that 150 trillion dollars in debt it's unsustainable when i say fully reserve what i mean is they are going to have to print money buy the bonds put them on their balance sheet uh right now they own whatever they own whatever percentage of that 150 trillion they own it almost has to by definition go up over time unless uh we get some miraculous productivity enhancing technologies rolled out in the very near term so i think it's very bullish for bitcoin i think it's very bullish for gold too let's see from mark if the fed raises rates five to seven times as our gurus on the street are projecting does jerome and company have the stomach to watch u.s equities drop potentially 50 percent plus is inflation now a bigger deal for the fed or will they do a january 2019 two-step and reverse course uh in my opinion no they're not going to raise rates that much if it was just equities dropping and i don't think they would weather 50 but if it was just 20 15 20 on equities that'd be one thing uh but as we're seeing um it's highly likely it's going to be u.s treasury yields rising sharply as stocks crash it's something we've been increasingly seeing since early 2018 we saw it in spades in 2020 and into 2021 we're seeing it again in the last two months and and uh they can't weather that in my view uh that's that's you know bond selling off stock selling off is the achilles heel of the whole leverage system um and so i i don't think they can weather that but the treasury part i think is the real key treasury yields rising as stocks fall inflation i do think is a bigger deal politically i think it's very cynical on the part of the republican party uh using it as a weapon against biden since really letting inflation run hot would be good for america but they it's it's an election year so they're they're they're using it in a very cynical manner politics is politics uh in my opinion though all the fed can really do beyond a rate hike or two token rate hike is is jawbone given uh given where we are with peak cheap energy peak cheap commodities as well as the debt and and deficit levels for the united states in particular but uh western sovereigns more broadly as well from max what in any way if any do the trucker protests in canada and elsewhere change the calculus for central bankers continuing to try to ride two horses with one ass i think it should be seen by them as a warning that future mismanagement of the economy will have increasingly acute problematic consequences both domestically domestically on the political side as well as on the social unrest side that said i don't think they're spending a lot of time worrying about it partly out of their dogma and partly out of them being in the washington dc bubble where they just they really don't notice things until it's very late or too late uh from russia uh a lot of questions about russia ukraine and my thoughts uh i don't have any strong feelings about the logistics the intelligence uh reports about where putin is where putin isn't where russian troops are where they're not etc there's better sources for that i would point you to them or even what putin's intentions are uh in terms of empire building or not my read is more intuitive i guess if you will and that is it number one if putin's position was as weak as as a lot of our policymakers say we wouldn't care for example we loved russia while yeltsin was there effectively breaking up the country selling it off in parts uh to western favorable oligarchs or western corporations and if you want more detail on that check out a 1998 article in the nation magazine called the harvard boys do russia i also think that what we are doing with russia is a total strategic misstep on our part if we want to win or compete effectively against china we need to separate russia and china and so if we are going to look at these two things if china is the greater adversarial threat over time as i think they are then we need to split russia and china and so the move we are making is effectively pushing russia and china closer together so literally 180 degrees opposite of what is the smart the the better strategy over the long term so maybe there's something else to play there that i'm missing uh i don't think there is unfortunately i just think we're making a mistake and then the last question from cm luke i don't recall ever hearing you speak about foreign equities do you balance your portfolio with foreign equities any thoughts on a falling dollar being an opportunity to profit in emerging markets i i i do have a few small just foreign funds it's not i don't really speak about it because it's really a rounding error uh to me i haven't spent really very much time on them at all uh because to me the biggest most important macro theme um has been and will continue to be the bursting global sovereign debt bubble the first one in a hundred years uh and and and so all these sovereigns have problems within that context and so for me in my opinion the best way that i see in terms of of of positioning uh to benefit from this first bursting global cyber debt bubble 100 years is being overweight gold being overweight bitcoin gold miners commodities and then uh industrials uh i also have uh an elevated cash position right now versus what i usually do uh just given volatility it's i think i've mentioned before i've been expecting volatility we've been seeing volatility um my way of hedging it has been owning a little bit of call options on equity volatility but mostly just carrying more cash and so golden commodities in particular have more of a quote-unquote foreign bent if you will um i have talked a bit about russian equities as as see all else equal they'd be really attractive if you can kind of get over the sanctions uh risk probably worth even just a small position uh but i think the sanctions risk keeps uh forces you to not get too far over your skis on that so at any rate that's all i've got for today i appreciate everybody

Will the US eventually have to cut entitlements like Stan Druckenmiller said?,2023-09-12 16:00:26+00:00,15,hJn6bSst31A,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJn6bSst31A,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everyone luke grohmann fft hope everybody's well i apologize for getting on a few minutes later than i had promised uh i hope everybody enjoyed a great weekend and was just wrapping up watching the end of that excellent euro 2020 final uh england came out on the short end so i'm sorry uh for my my english friends but uh excited for my italian friends so i'm gonna be i'm gonna be pretty diplomatic about the about the game so with that we are gonna jump right in uh to the questions thank you everyone for joining us as usual uh the first question is from je is the net effect of michael saylor's multiple moves within microstrategy around bitcoin accretive or dilutive to existing stockholders and is there a synthetic strike price or point in time that it becomes one or the other to the new bondholders or existing shareholders um it depends of course on what price uh and what price of bitcoin what bitcoin does uh if i i've not done the math myself i've read very good analysis of um what is essentially a very convex uh payoff uh graph in both directions if bitcoin rises or if bitcoin falls it was put together by michael cowe who goes by at urbancowboy on twitter definitely a a very good follow uh if you don't follow him already michael cao k-a-k-a-o uh spelling of his last name at any rate i believe when he did that analysis that you'd be able to google and find online uh that the break even point if you will of that convex on the upside and downside analysis uh the break even for bitcoin at that point a couple months ago was about twenty five thousand dollars so i will answer that and just point you to that because uh i'm not going to recreate what the excellent excellent analysis he did from peter we'd love to see you mention something uh about your last video debt to gdp at 130 percent now versus a hundred percent in 2008 interest rates considerably lower debt servicing costs also lower why is this leave the us in a considerably worse position and not a better one and i think it's it's in a worse position because the future optionality is reduced versus what it was then not just by the higher debt levels uh and the lower rates but also by the fact that u.s entitlement programs have gone significantly free cash flow negative now and and so in plain english uh the only politically and economically palatable and possible option left is to inflate the debt away basically let inflation run hot while the fed keeps interest rates below and ideally well below the rate of inflation in other words significantly negative real interest rates uh and then tries to convince the public that uh inflation is transitory inflation is more tame than it is uh and interestingly this to my eyes appears to be exactly what u.s policymakers and and global policymakers uh more broadly are doing it it's the only playbook they have i can't fault them they let the system evolve to this point once the coveted crisis hit uh they have they have only one option really uh multiple questions regarding the basel iii uh nsfr's net stable funding ratio for gold rule change carve out for the lbma i did see that i have been reading about it a bit i have not concluded on everything yeah i'm still digging into it and trying to fully understand it with that said a couple things that grabbed my attention about it number one uh apparently is specifically for clearing not for loans and leases in the gold business uh and it appears that the eu and u.s are still abiding by those rules while as the lbma in london uh has a carve out uh what does that mean i don't fully know yet my gut tells me with an incomplete understanding that if the lbma is celebrating and high-fiving this carve out it's probably not a positive for for the thesis for my thesis that that this ns nsfr appears to be an unwind a mandated unwind of the unallocated gold market in london uh with that said uh let's see exactly what it means because again it's for clearing it's not for loans and leases so uh more on it as i get a chance to really dig into it and kind of feel it out but those are my initial thoughts uh from wd uh riff on china credit tightening new ambassador tech crackdown capital controls etc the the the chinese credit tightening to me uh that has been happening there's uh the china credit china credit impulse is cited by a number of different uh brokers there's a data series on it on bloomberg i believe at any rate uh it has rolled over sharply in the last call at three four months i think you've started to see those deflationary impulses in a number of different asset markets commodities u.s treasuries etc with that said i think something that happened last week that didn't get enough uh uh airplay was uh china coming out and saying that they are looking at cutting their reserve require a required reserve ratio or triple r uh to try to stimulate their economy more to stimulate small business growth in their economy more this was a surprise it was not expected and to the extent uh that it is followed through on uh may mark a reversal in the china credit tightening worth watching uh in terms of the tech crackdown uh i'm probably not the right guy to talk to on it i mean ultimately i think two things i've read that have caught my attention number one uh the the detective the tech crackdown appears to be a difference of philosophical views uh the chinese state wants the state to have the greatest power over the uh the collection of tech data the usage of tech data the us is ostensibly or nominally okay with private companies collecting and using that data uh as a practical matter if we really if we really call things what they are i would argue that the u.s tech companies with the most data uh names like google or uh facebook or uh amazon uh alphabet uh are de facto relatively they have very close relationships with the u.s state i would argue and so to me it comes down to which government do you feel better having your private data and that is ultimately usa hands down and so i think over time that is positive for capital flows uh with that said uh oh that's an all else equal equation uh in the last year we've actually seen capital lee you know on a net basis moved to china from the u.s on the interest rate differential you get 300 basis points more uh in chinese government bonds than you do in the us and people are saying investors on the margin are seeing that uh as a uh as an adequate compensation for the other risks uh involved with investing in china as opposed to the u.s so um watching the tech interest with great interest i think ultimately u.s tech much better position because of uh that one key factor which is ultimately i think most people in the world would feel much better with the us government handling their data than the chinese government or u.s government proxies uh than the chinese government is probably the better way to put it uh from age how much longer do you think the u.s has before a debt default or solution to reserve currency status also do you think politically the democrats will try to keep the economy propped up low rates print print as much as possible before the 2024 election uh i two-part question there i don't think the u.s will ever explicitly default uh i but i as i noted the only politically and economically palatable option left really at this point post covet is to try to inflate the debt away keep interest rates well below the rate of inflation try to convince the public that inflation is both well below uh the well well below what it actually is and that it whatever uh modicum of inflation exists is transitory and will go away soon and so i i would say that process of financial oppression slow default whatever you want to call that i think it's already underway on some level i don't think it's moving fast enough but i think it's underway on some level in terms of uh the the reserve currency question uh to me there are two constituencies within washington dc with two diametrically opposite views of the dollar and the dollar system as it's been structured since 1971. i think there is a large group that still sees the post 1971 dollar system as structured uh since nixon closed the gold window as a major u.s advantage and i think there's a second group that uh recognizes that realizes that it has actually become a disadvantage for the u.s that china is repeatedly using against us uh precovid uh the first group the the former group the group that saw the dollar system as structured post 71 uh as as nothing but an advantage that group dominated uh policy discussions etc postcoded when even tourists to the dollar system the currency systems to global supply chains could get on the news and see hey we can't get drugs we can't get ppe we can't get masks we are completely vulnerable and open to china and china's whims something needs to change i think the group seeing the dollar system as structured post 71 gained a lot of members post covid because of that and so i think it's a much more evenly matched discussion between the group that sees in washington that sees the dollar system as as purely an advantage and the group that sees it realizes that is increasingly a disadvantage i don't know how those two sides will end up netting out i think it is still uh open for debate i think it's still an open contest with both sides trying to push their agendas if you will in the meantime it appears to us the preponderance of the evidence suggests uh that the world continues to move toward what appears to be the new system which is a multi-currency pricing of commodities and settlement uh effectively settlement in in countries exported goods with any net amount left over settling in physical gold and so if you've got basically the us has historically settled trade in financial assets and the world increasingly wants either finite financial assets in other words the chinese will happily sell us goods but in return for that they will no longer take treasuries they will take increasingly large ownership stakes in u.s companies and so the question then becomes is is it in the united states interest for us to sell amazon google facebook uh lockheed martin etc and those are not necessarily specific exact examples but i want to try to make the point here so there this is a bit over the top to make the point but the point is is that we send dollars to china china sends goods china then takes the dollars they used to buy treasuries and just buy more and more and more treasuries that worked out great they're not buying the treasuries now now they're buying finite stakes in u.s companies u.s assets global ports etc strategic assets and that's why i say the dollar system is structured is sort of already breaking down they're not buying treasuries anymore we're basically hocking our crown jewels to china uh for ongoing supplies of stuff we buy in stores pharmaceuticals masks etc my view has long been that that is not in the interest of the united states to continue doing that at infinitum and as i noted before there is a growing group of people in washington that realize that also that that is not in our interest as a nation uh there's still a large group um in washington that think that for some reason isn't our interest and i won't go into it more than that i guess the last part of that question is do i think politically the democrats will try to keep the economy propped up i think both sides are going to try to keep it propped up i think we may see some kabuki theater around republicans like joe manchin trying to hold things up uh for his constituency within west virginia or other republicans within their respective constituencies however again it goes back to where the fiscal situation is post covet it really doesn't matter i think which side is in power there's only really one politically and economically palatable possible playbook which is you've got to grow gdp well in excessive inflation keep interest rates well below the rate of nominal gdp and try to grow your way out of it over time and so i think that will continue to be the playbook from democrats republicans independents everybody and so i think it'll be real important to you know if if there is a an actual holdout and things do get held up that is a very big problem it's a very risk off in my view and it would likely be good for the dollar it'd be good in the short term for treasury bonds and it'd be bad for virtually all other asset classes i don't think uh such a risk off period will last very long because i think ultimately i don't think congress would have to come into their office for too many days with the dow down 500 to 1 000 points too many days in a row uh before the market would basically brow beat congress into doing what had to be done to kind of keep things going because again post covert were left with this unsustainable fiscal position in the u.s specifically but in particularly in western social democracies but around the world as well so with that i am going to sign off for tonight i want to thank everybody once again for joining me it's great as always catching up and uh as always if you're interested in what we're up to or like these updates check us out fftt dash dot for more information about uh upcoming

"Lagged effects of rate hikes, trade-offs between Treasury & DoD",2023-08-22 17:23:18+00:00,17,twbKzY-eMiA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twbKzY-eMiA,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope everybody is well had a great weekend and had a good start to the week this week just wanted to uh highlight a couple things here i'm going to jump right in in terms of some of the questions try to maximize the time together first question we had was from cc luke what do you make of this uh a headline that just hit after the close today powell set to deliver profoundly consequential speech quote unquote changing how the fed views inflation uh and uh this ties into a number of uh questions we had regarding jackson hole and what might be said uh clearly he's going to deliver a consequential uh speech or what the fed sees a profoundly consequential speech what do i think this could mean i would direct your attention back to a black rock white paper blackrock investment institute white paper published the week before last year's jackson hole meeting you can find it online google it it was written by former fed vice chair stan fisher philip former swiss national bank head phillip hildebrand and former bank of canada governor john boyvin i would take the time to read this white paper right now if you haven't read it it was something we saw last year we highlighted for our clients last august we highlighted it a number of times since for our clients it is a pivotal profound white paper probably 16 20 pages long it lays out the game plan the paper was basically in the next crisis we are going to have to go direct we are going to bypass the traditional interest rate channel we are going to take the cap off of the inflation genie we're not exactly sure how we are going to get it back in the bottle uh and we're here's the game plan for the various regions it is a step-by-step way that the central banks will implement mmt on their terms working with the fiscal authorities my suspicion is that powell is basically following the game plan that this is rolling that out and uh for someone importantly by contact for context uh stan fisher one of my best relationships on wall street calls him the godfather of central bankers uh was a mentor to both bernanke and draghi uh others in if they're very in touch uh have confirmed as much to me so i i i wasn't sure what to think going into jackson hole this headline having seen it half an hour ago i think we're going to see um the fed be more aggressive so let's watch that second question from daniel i've heard your thesis many times but how will the fed prince at all scenario affect people in the euro area and in particular netherlands and germany my thesis is really around two things number one oil and commodities are priced in uh the major currencies dollar euro yuan maybe sterling but yen as well but certainly euro yuan dollar and then every central bank has to print their own deficits and so under that scenario uh northern europe ends up being able to buy oil and gas and other imports for their industrial machine in euros that's a good thing the trade-off is that their currency is likely to rise against the dollar because the americans are going to print uh their deficits and nobody can beat us with deficits we've got the biggest ones so um as trump might say they are huge so basically what we're likely to see and what we are seeing a transition towards and what we think will be the end game is multiple currency pricing of energy in commodities and every region responsible for financing its own deficits and under that scenario that would basically be a re-rating of currencies in the sdr basket top to bottom based on balance of payments and so number one currency would be either europe or china in terms of relative strength the yen right there with them and then the sterling weaker and the dollar much weaker and then uh you basically compete on a more um even playing field let's see uh from rb who is the biggest buyer of treasuries now i understand the central bank stopped buying treasuries in third quarter 14 and the global private sector uh stopped in and 3q it says here 19 that's really more 3q18 where do you see the real nominal yield on treasuries a year from now so first off it's interesting you've seen fx hedge treasury yields which went negative for the foreign private sector in 3q18 have us turned positive uh since earlier this year and so in theory uh particularly for japanese buyers there is a yield pick up by buying us treasury so we'll see the the japanese private sector i would not be surprised to see them participate uh more strongly than they have over the last 12 months in treasury auctions however the biggest buyers uh biggest marginal buyers have been the fed uh u.s banks commercial banks and u.s pensions and and domestic mutual fund investors and i suspect that those three the fed domestic banks and u.s pensions and mutual fund investors the u.s private sector broadly will continue to be the biggest buyers of u.s treasuries what do i where do i see the real nominal yield on treasuries a year from now this is going to sound flip it's not meant to be i see nominal yields wherever the fed wants them and wherever the fed pins them and wherever the fed wants or pins them will be based on wherever is politically expedient for the us government wherever is politically expedient for the u.s government is probably around here um we've we've got a lot of debt we have a lot of obligations we have a highly financialized economy we have a great power competition with china to finance uh we have a lot of entitlements and none of those things will be better with higher rates they will all be better with lower rates here or lower so um i suspect the us would like to have a positively sloped yield curve with uh low absolute rates at the long end so i don't know that nominal rates will change a whole lot from where they are today i think uh is is that's my final answer and then noah what asset allocation would you recommend for a pension fund today today i don't know where i'd be on equities but i the one thing i feel very very strongly about is that i would be moving two to five percent of my bond allocation into gold and gold miners and or bitcoin uh if i was a plain vanilla us or global pension fund rates are near zero um and there's only they can only go so negative so there's only so much upside left for bonds i don't think that there's a huge amount of nominal downside for bonds per my prior point sovereigns i think are likely to see rates kept uh at politically expedient levels bigger risk to me is the rate is the risk of inflation uh and you know the bottom line is that gold has no upside on this price no upside limit on its price bonds do uh and so uh if we do get some sort of credit problem that uh really hurts the system um that increases yeah that increases the the um the possibility gold ultimately like the the uh um the dutch national bank said last year gold would be used to rebuild the system and it would be used at a much higher price and that's why central banks own gold and so if that's why central banks own gold it's unclear to me why pensions don't own a little bit of gold too especially now that we're here so that is it for today i appreciate everybody joining me and for uh sending in the questions on twitter uh i also wanted to give a special thank you to everybody that bought our new book my new book the mr x interviews volume 2 released on thursday morning it was a number one a new release on in macroeconomics on amazon and uh spent some time as the number one best seller in macro economics on saturday on amazon which is very exciting so thank you to all of you for buying that i appreciate it if you haven't bought it check it out on amazon also obviously volume two follows a volume one the mr x interviews volume one

context we've been getting a lot of great feedback from investors on that piece comes out every friday and with that i will uh jump for tonight again thanks everyone for joining me and i look forward to catching up with you soon everybody have a great rest of your week take care [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] you
"Why more things haven’t broken given rapid rate hikes, and thoughts on BOJ widening YCC tolerance.",2023-08-02 16:00:44+00:00,17,u3z-uHA9kJk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3z-uHA9kJk,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fftt hope you're well hope you had a great weekend it was a beautiful sunny sunday here a little on the cool side but we're able to watch some baseball uh and so that was a always a good day so at any rate i'm gonna jump right into it thank you everybody as always for submitting the questions a lot of really good questions so i'm going to start off with hh larry summers recently mentioned that recession can be delayed with luck and policies such as strategic oil reserve releases increasing immigration maybe a few other things do you agree what else can our policymakers do to delay the inevitable uh in my opinion no uh i think summers is engaging in some wishful thinking colored by his uh views on foreign policy um u.s energy spending as a percent of gdp was already high enough to trigger a recession uh before russia invaded ukraine uh and and the eu's was certainly high enough uh and and with so much leverage in the system in the west but broadly speaking that if the eu has a recession the u.s is likely going to have a recession shortly thereafter or vice versa if the us doesn't have one on its own merits so what else could the u.s do um in theory it could unsanction russia uh and it could restart qe uh both of those things would work really well uh i don't know that we're there yet on either one it could come up with some sort of new uh energy miracle cure if you will that drops energy prices dramatically immediately and is able to be commercialized that would work too i don't think that's on the on the horizon in the uh investable future so i i think we're heading for an energy driven recession now from sj at some point it will be wise to buy bonds again at what point uh i think it depends on your time horizon are you a trader or are you a an investor real basis you're looking at bonds on a real basis as a trader bonds sure could bonds be worth a punt here or a trade here given the weakness and growing weakness in the economy as well as global economic and geopolitical problems possible possible as an investor i don't think bonds are a buy until u.s debt to gdp has fallen from 125 percent to 80 of gdp or less because until debt the gdp is that low again the united states cannot afford to pay positive real rates which means that bonds have to lose money on a real basis until us that the gdp is that low um and if they're losing money on a real basis why do you want to be involved as an investor so um that that's the real basis side of it as well and so to me it really just depends on your time verizon but as an investor which is how i look at my own funds you know gold is just a bond of of of infinite duration and finite issuance and infinite face value why would i hold bonds instead of gold when gold is a bond is a pond of finite duration infinite issuance and finite face value it just until the sovereign balance sheets are fixed broadly speaking and i pick on the us because the u.s is the global reserve currency issuer so we haven't had a situation where the global reserve currency issuer has a balance of payments and fiscal and debt problem in a long long time bonds are not they they can't be allowed to have positive real rates by the issuing authority if they want to work that debt down so hope that helps uh from john what's your reply to jeff and emil's latest video jeff snyder and emil kalinowski uh both friends of mine latest video titled there is no such thing as a petro dollar do they make the euro dollar system out to be more important than it actually is uh i thought it was a very well done uh write-up i for me the issues that i saw with it were that it ignored geopolitics it ignored the us balance of payments and ignored physical world reality physics in other words as an example how many wars have been fought by the u.s since the euro dollar system really got big as as jeff and emil's piece pointed out in the 70s how many wars has the u.s fought with oil nations versus how many financial capitals has the u.s military occupied uh since the 1970s uh you know when when have we invaded hong kong when we invaded singapore when have we invaded london uh when have we invaded new york uh and the answer is we haven't when have we invaded the middle east one of we attacked the middle east one of we've been at odds with russia um a lot uh and so the the it also ignores the the the reality that global balance of payments imbalances tend to be very heavily influenced if not driven by energy um and so if you have energy driving outsized impacts on global balance of payments you have energy driving outsize impacts on fx pairs which means by definition you have uh outsized impacts of energy on the dollar on the euro dollar system and that's ignoring um you know their point in the 70s they bring it up how much how many oil dollars were flowing into london um uh as as part of the euro dollar system so um that's another side of it is just that balance of payments point and then finally uh i think it also ignores the the physics the real world where the financial world meets the physical world that look all that euro dollar debt it cannot be repaid without the without the expenditure of energy uh and energy is primarily oil and gas so basically take away oil and gas all those euro dollars are all that euro dollar debt is going to default and that then completely changes the system that completely renders those assets those euro dollar loan assets impaired if not worthless uh and so i think that is some of the same mistake that a lot of western strategists have made by looking at russia's gdp by mentioning it by measuring it on uh purchasing power parity or by looking at it strictly on gdp rather as looking at it at value and value of russia's gdp is very very different than russia's price of gdp what i mean by that is russia's gdp to oversimplify is the number of barrels they produce times the price per barrel of oil times the number of days in a year the value of russia's gdp is the number of barrels that uh russia produces times 365 days in a year times the work in each of those barrels there's 25 000 man hours of work in a barrel times 20 per per man hour every barrel of oil is worth 500 000 of economic value multiply that times russia's oil output times 365 days you get a very different result for russia's economic impact and that's the one we need to think about when you start talking about removing russia's oil impact from the global economy when you start talking about sanctioning all russia's oil out of the global economy in a highly levered economy that is more than enough to collapse the global economy so those are my when i i thought it was a great piece by jeff and by emo but i think it ignores the second derivative a number of second derivative impacts geopolitics balance of payments impacts of energy and therefore fx cross pairs and then uh the physical world realities of of look there's a lot of debt in the world it's not payable if you take out just russian oil and gas let alone all oil and gas uh from c do you see the ruble continue to approve against the dollar yes with an asterisk with the asterisk being as long as it's in russia's interest to do so i think the key is that russia has conclusively empirically demonstrated uh the ability to manage it via ruble for gas and gold and use it to effectively break u.s sanctions which has happened and this is uh we've been writing about it in tree rings saying look russia russia has far more leverage than western consensus says we've been saying this since day one we were surprised by the invasion but once it happened we said look russia has way more leverage than people think we've seen that play out over the last two weeks in real time and so i think that continues to be the case so uh from tony how does russia dropping their fixed exchange rate for gold versus ruble adjust your thesis do you see do you still see gold soaring in price as much it's unclear to me that russia did that the russian central bank press release when you translate it to english merely says they're going to a negotiated price from 5 000 rubles per gram it's unclear to me if that means a drop or if it means a rise or if it means a a move depending on russia's russia's needs uh the reuters article seemed to imply a drop in price i'm not sure that that's the case either way i think it's important to take a step back as one of my best relationships on wall street pointed out to me we were talking about it last week he goes luke look is it up down is is it up a little is it down a little i don't know but don't miss the force for the trees a major global central bank the central bank of the world's biggest energy exporter has drawn a line under gold they are bidding for gold that's an enormous signpost in and of itself and i think i think that's the right way to think about it it's how i'm currently thinking about it uh from rob question how could gold become again become a reserve asset given the difficulty improving authenticity there's many tungsten bars which are difficult to verify versus smaller coins unless you melt them down also the difficulty in transporting gold i you know the us used to send a plane full of gold bullion to saudi arabia at least once a month i believe as recently as the the mid to late 60s um and in terms of the the difficulty i think i think look no gold no energy you know you don't send the gold uh then you don't get next month's shipment of energy um i think it's a very powerful motivator um you know is is is that difficult is that expensive does that take a lot of effort absolutely it does but so does finding and producing oil and this is where i think the world needs to move to where the world wants to move to where it has to move to if we don't want the system to collapses we need to move to tough to produce oil and gas for tough to produce gold because what we're watching is the producers in the world not just of oil and gas but of goods saying that the tough to produce oil and goods for easy to produce negative real yielding treasury bonds is going to result in our bankruptcy and so yes is gold hard to assay move transport ship all that absolutely but so is oil so is gas so are factory goods and so this system that we've all grown up under that hey the world is going to give us very difficult and expensive to produce goods for for treasury bonds that can be be created by a keystroke that's the world that's ending and so i think um yes gold is absolutely a pain in the butt to move so's oil so i think that's really where we're moving from np when is the last time the world's financial system was balanced against or four commodities what are some lessons we can learn or how do we prepare for a world where commodities reign supreme i don't know exactly how to sort of think about that i would i think i would look at it as financial when take a look at gold as a percentage of financial assets uh a total financial assets outstanding as a read on when that last happened and i want to say you go back to like 1980 i want to say gold was still two and a half percent or more of of global financial assets and that would probably be the tail end of the last time that this was the case um and so the outcome would be that for gold to really be able to settle commodities to gold for gold to serve as a neutral reserve asset to settle commodities you're gonna have to reprice gold orders of magnitude higher with a much smaller uh paper market or at least a paper market with much uh less influence on the physical market um with that said i'd also i'm not sure that commodities will end up reigning supreme per se but i do think that uh what we are in the still the early days of is you know share of global economic value accruing to commodities uh and commodities producers is likely going to rise meaningfully here secularly it needs to in order to get the capital to get the commodities produced that support the rest of global economic activity and that that economic activity uh share accruing to commodities producers is at near historic lows and so i think it has a ways to go uh from edward do you have a thought as to the general time frame when the fed when you think the fed might be forced to announce that it's changing directions i i think we're probably three to four months out in my opinion uh at the longest uh rates around the world particularly in the west are becoming problematic you've already got the the japanese and the chinese getting more uh stimulative uh which are generally a leading indicator for what the us does uh global geopolitics and trade are also uh serving as effective rate increases to uh with liquidity withdrawals becoming problematic so i i think we're probably three to four months out from the fed having to reverse uh probably at the longest uh from rh hi luke in a crisis do you think the canadian government could try to solve its no official gold problem by nationalizing the mines how would shareholders fare in such a scenario in a word yes i do especially in the aftermath of prime minister trudeau's actions shall we call them in regards um the the trucker protest a couple months ago with what he did with financial and bank accounts uh i think ultimately this continues to move towards this if you don't hold it you don't own it dynamic that is one of the defining features of macro and financial markets here uh year to date with the fx reserve sanctions the u.s and eu put on russia a question for me is how it would be structured a would canada nationalize its minds i think it's entirely possible in extremis b what would that look like in my opinion it would probably be were it to happen and again this is a tail risk for me this is not my base case i want to make that clear but if it were to happen i think it would be something along the lines of all excess profits over twenty five hundred dollars per ounce or three thousand dollars per ounce would accrue to the canadian government or something like that uh and so basically canadian government would be buying all physical from their own minds at 2 500 or 3 000 an ounce effectively and um that's still a really good outlook for miners um it would probably lead to massive dividend increases amongst minors do they pay out the resulting profits to shareholders um however i think it's entirely possible if not likely and i do think this is likely that physical gold outperforms the miners uh in the seven you know in this cycle which is unlike the 70s gold cycle in the 30s gold cycle i think it's very possible excuse me um if if not likely that physical gold outperforms um uh the miners as a result uh from brian for those of us who have been contributing to a 401k for 20 to 25 years what's our move with an impending unwind coming already moved to a nice portion of uh a number of different bitcoin miners bitcoin holdings etc do we sell take the penalty and just buy bitcoin outright to protect ourselves i would not sell everything and pay the penalty on 401ks i the outlook is not great right now and there's a lot of very potentially dramatic things that could happen for me i think you want to diversify and there's a number of different diversification i think you want to own inflation or excuse me politically acceptable inflation hedges and non-politically acceptable inflation hedges right so the former politically acceptable it's stocks real estate uh commodities non-acceptable gold bitcoin um i think you want to diversify amongst your allocations broadly so i i continue to think given the um where we are in the long cycle with that given the extremes of what's happening with with um entitlements geopolitical developments how political markets are uh i think you need what we've referred to before as the jacob fooger allocation which he was the richest man in the world historically as a percent of the economy and he had a very simplistic approach is 25 cash 25 percent stocks 25 real estate 25 gold and then re-weight as needed now for today's time you know that's my version of today's time i would mix uh depending on your risk uh ability uh you know maybe it's twenty percent gold five percent bitcoin may if you're if you're really strong on bitcoin maybe it's 20 bitcoin five percent gold i don't know a quarter of it though you want to have in a neutral reserve asset for me it's mostly gold with with still a lot of bitcoin um for he also his originally was bonds cash real estate gold for me as i mentioned before gold and bonds are very similar instruments gold has infinite duration finite issuance and infinite face value bonds with also especially with negative real rates that they need to be to finance governments are finite duration infinite issuance and and finite face value so i just think i'd rather gold than bonds uh until governments fiscal positions and sovereign debt positions are in a position where they can raise rates without blowing up the system where they can actually afford to pay positive real rates and so i think that's that's how that's how i would think about it in terms of just this diversification of um politically acceptable non-politically acceptable diversification across asset classes and then two i think this ties into the politically acceptable versus nonpoliticial uh politically uh uh acceptable versus non-politically acceptable i think you wanna own assets in the system and assets out of the system right so your your your gold and your bitcoin are out of the system i don't think you want to be entirely out of the system though because look the system might win and and the system might sustain and so if you start paying huge penalties on 401ks things like that they're very tough to overcome so i i think you want to have you your 401ks your iras like that i just don't think it's prudent to be pulling everything out and putting it all into a bitcoin or a gold or or cash there's there are so many things that could happen uh worse at such stretched extremes on any number of metrics that i just think you need to be diversified across politically acceptable non-politically acceptable asset classes and system versus not system now let's see last question from rd hey luke what are the chances that spiking bond yields cause the fed to enact yield curve control and that sends risk assets higher without any downturn occurring first base case seems to be recession slash decline then printing money but trying to evaluate alternative possibilities i think it's very possible uh there's an increasing number of market participants sitting in senior seats around wall street that understand the implications of the u.s fiscal situation the u.s debt situation as a reserve currency issuer they also understand what's going on in europe china i know this because i i interact with a number of them and and they understand broad more broadly that sovereigns more broadly excuse me that basically the bubble is in sovereign debt this time and that sovereigns broadly as a result are in no position to allow yields to rise too far and so given that in terms of just senior market participants understanding this a growing number of them it's entirely possible that markets just look right through any value of a valley of a recession um that and i think gold might be an example of this beginning to happen in other words the fact that gold is still rising with real yields and nominal yields doing what they have done year to date is a huge correlation break and one of my best relationships on the street always says listen it's these macro correlation breaks where there's really important information and to see gold doing what it's doing while rates are doing what they're doing and real rates are doing what they're doing huge macro correlation break that's telling us basically there's a whole bunch of people saying i don't care about real rates rising as it relates to my goal rising real rates are going to bankrupt sovereigns and the last thing i want to do ahead of real rates breaking sovereigns is sell gold i want to buy gold and that and that's what i think we're seeing with gold as rates rise gold's rising and i think that's why as rates rise sovereign debt crisis for even the united states gets closer and closer and that sovereign debt crisis looks like yield curve control it looks like everybody doing what japan did and i think that's really um positive for risk assets broadly so the question then is is our risk assets in addition to gold going to look across the valley like gold has been looking across the valley it's not my base case but it's a very valid question um now do i it's still not my base case but i think it's very possible that risk assets just completely look across the valley and and importantly you know unless you're a trader month-to-month with a marked month-to-month i when you look at the fiscal and debt positions at the u.s europe globally that with the problem at the sovereign debt where all these countries can print money uh to keep debt nominally and sovereign debt nominally solvent any downturn any big downturn i think it's going to be measured in weeks if not days and so like i said that's why it really comes down to if you're if you're trading week-to-week month-to-month hey i get it these but for our purposes you know for my purposes with my own funds i i don't really care month to month because we can see where this is all going and as long as we manage our our chips so to speak um in in a in a conservative enough manner right that that jacob fugger type allocation where look you're sitting on a huge i am i've probably got up to 20 cash right now um that's my volatility hedge and that is also um for me it's it's it's it's optionality uh we've got a lot of commodities gold bitcoin some real estate positions um i'm under levered and look if if i'm wrong on the political timing if something happens i have that dry powder where i can add to it because we can see with the sovereign debt positions where they are u.s europe around the world unless sovereigns are going to be willing to stand aside and let let you know allow themselves their central banks allow these sovereigns to default on their their obligations both debt and entitlements then we know the central banks are going to have to react very quickly and very aggressively like we saw in 2020 so with that i'm going to finish up for today i want to thank everybody again for joining me as always if you'd like to check out what we're up to learn more about um different appearances etc and go to fftt-llc you can also learn about our tree rings product there which is 10 most interesting things quick synopsis of each about different events etc news stories that either fit or don't fit a lot of times with trying to triangulate into what's happening out there for our clients so everybody have a great rest of your week and we will catch up with you soon take care everyone [music] you
BRICS currency initial thoughts; CNY devaluation impact on oil; Global liquidity and USD outlooks,2023-07-11 16:00:33+00:00,13,_Z2MpNTWasU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z2MpNTWasU,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fftt hope everybody's well sorry i'm a couple minutes late i was watching phil mickelson walk up to the 18th hole so uh no spoiler alerts i had to pause the tv um so kind of exciting for us old guys to uh uh one of one of us old guys to be leading a major so late so rooting for phil good guy so let's jump right into it here uh the first question came from prof he said you sold the majority of your bitcoin almost at the top what was the thought process behind you selling uh i i wish it was almost at the top it wasn't at the top it was called the 48 to 48 000 to 52 000 range uh it was the majority of my bitcoin i still own bitcoin i still like bitcoin but what we wrote uh to our tree ring subscribers uh a week ago friday so the 14th of may was that it seemed like the regulatory risk of bitcoin had risen meaningfully in the prior two weeks first off uh somebody who i respect garrett greatly harold malmgren who's very tight in warned or highlighted that the irs would consider bitcoin property and would be able to confiscate bitcoin for unpaid taxes uh to me that also raised the possibility of of talking about taxing property on a proper assessing property taxes i've not seen anything about that but that seemed to open that door when harold talked about that uh we saw binance being investigated by the department of justice a headline came out that week uh we saw bitcoin very publicly was uh cited as being paid as ransom in the colonial pipeline uh attack which to me uh also uh got thrown in the pile with greater regulatory pressure or concern and then just this continued environmental narrative that it's bad for the environment which i think is uh largely crap but um it is what it is you can tell the narrative being spun by mainstream media uh that that is um that it's a narrative and so we've when we said that we sold most of our bitcoin i finished by writing i finished that tree ring section by writing quote with all that said is bitcoin bulls what is fft doing to hedge what appears to be rapidly rising political risk to bitcoin and other cryptos our strategy is twofold first we continue to add to other inflation hedges both those seen as future reserve assets by other nations ie gold and to quote unquote politically acceptable inflation hedges equities secondly this week i sold enough bitcoin to pay off substantially all of my family's personal debt and i also set aside to pay the taxes on the gains my thought is that i don't know what will happen to bitcoin politically but if at the very least bitcoin has allowed me to deleverage my family pretty much entirely then from then i'm playing with house money with the bitcoin i have left regardless of whether it goes up a lot from here or goes to zero bitcoin will help me liquidate most of my personal debts which is in my view always a major win in my opinion the seeming increasing political risk to bitcoin and the crypto area more broadly may come to nothing but wanted to share my thoughts on it personally knowing i'm playing with house money from this point allows me to sleep much better at night so that's why i did what i did i still really like bitcoin and i will be uh i still want to add to it uh but for the moment i'm john i'm not adding to it now uh so that's the thought process there second question from tamai thanks luke why do you prefer the big tech in this current environment as i've heard uh you saying in many youtube videos this seems to be contradictory to your commodities gold or bitcoin picks which are good inflationary and debasement scenarios how does big tech fit in record sovereign debt levels means that real rates likely have to go very negative and tech stocks have done very well with negative real rates and so i think this is one way that this cycle is likely to be a little different than pretty much any of the cycles we've had over the last 50 years which is to say i think both commodities and your traditional reflation plays do well but then i also think tech uh also does well because uh the sovereign debt component this time means you have to have financial repression to keep real rates negative so the sovereign can grow out of their debt which in my opinion means tech should also do well from vic where are we in the cycle uh i think we're early in the business cycle and i think we are very very very late in the long-term debt cycle we've talked a number of times about how the we had an equity bubble it blew up or it popped we kicked the problems upstairs to the housing market uh we created a housing bubble to paper over the lost demand from the equity bubble bursting uh the housing bubble popped we kicked the problems upstairs to the sovereign now we have a sovereign debt bubble and there's nowhere to kick that upstairs to to the uh except to the currency itself by debasing the currency so that's where i think we are and i think it's important to remember most people are simply looking at the short-term cycle of hey it's a reflationary trade i need to own commodities and banks and and and industrials and agree uh particularly the commodities industrials but virtually nobody is also saying we're also very very late in the long term debt cycle uh and that means things that you might not want to own in a typical early cycle and the short cycle things like gold things like bitcoin sitting things like negative real rate beneficiaries like tech those things you need to own this time because we're at the very very tail end of a long-term debt cycle uh let's see next question solar from i'm reading more and more on fintu it about the upcoming basel three new rules coming on june 28th in europe and i believe the us those go live in the uk as it stands now on january 1st there is a growing belief that the excessive price suppression paper gold trading gold paper trading will be heavily impaired by these rules any thoughts on it uh this ties into another question as well from oc where he said what thoughts what stories that are hiding out in the open are you noticing this is one of those stories that is hiding right out in the open anyone can look at it anyone can read it i would highly encourage you to go read what alasdair mcclaude has written about it it's excellent he wrote something on the 13th of may and something again on the 20th of may to me it does seem like this is designed these regulations from the bis are designed to force the unwind of the allocated gold market to a large extent centered in london and if so that could really be positive for the price of gold as we move into the back half of this year and then into 2022 and beyond um i'm i'm really reticent to get too excited about it some of that's because i'm just i'm so scared as as anyone else that's owned gold for so long we've seen these types of things before where this is it it's going to be it's going to be named hqla or it's it's this is this is it and then inevitably lucy pulls the football away from charlie brown so to speak and and it doesn't happen so i'm reticent to say this is it here we go it's all going to happen at once with that said the language does seem very likely to force and unwind in the unallocated gold market of some magnitude centered in london all else equal to be quite positive for gold prices over time so let's watch as i like to write in in tree rings um things can still change but i do think it could be a potentially important development as we look after the back half of this year from todd but given what is going on in reverse repo and sloppier long end auctions is an actual operation twist coming soon with an actual sale of short insecurities uh from the fed balance sheet and equivalent increase in long end purchases could this be why nominal treasury yields are weak last week i think we're already seeing a mini twist uh already in fact they they really announced a very mini twist that they being the fed last week where they sold a little bit out of the front end and and bought a little bit more uh or at the long end they announced that they would be doing that going forward that process has started if you look at the data uh it's not a huge deal the the people in the technical and plumbing side of the business will say oh it's not a big deal yet i agree nominally technically it's not that big a deal the amounts aren't that big yet however to the extent that we know the fed absolutely wants to avoid yield curve control and i think we can infer that based on their pronouncements and other conversations i've had this is a small step in that direction uh they're trying to control the shape of the curve i would call it more yield curve management than yield curve control but all else equal to me it's it's a step in that direction that we think they're going anyway so i think it's an important signpost so let's see what happens but but that that operation twist uh at least mini twist if you will in in my view has already started uh from knox biden cuts proposes cutting supply chain from infrastructure plan wtf question mark uh you know what next that was my reaction too uh this doesn't make sense to me uh i don't know if the larry summers and bill dudley wing of of washington have gotten to people in the biden administration that uh with the fear-mongering about inflation what have you um maybe it's just political positioning and in terms of negotiating with the republicans which if gun in my head today with as little as i know about it is probably what it is but it doesn't make sense but i do think it's really important to watch because anything that sends u.s gdp growth lower will send u.s real rates higher and anything that sends u.s gdp rates or excuse me u.s real rates higher when u.s debt to gdp is 130 percent is problematic for pretty much every risk asset out there it would all it's equal probably good for the dollar good for volatility not a lot else so let's see how that develops and then finally from om i'm a fan and fftt subscriber thank you very much for your business we appreciate it uh please explain why lacey hunt and steven van meter and epb research eric basmajian i think is his last name about are wrong about transitory inflation you don't believe the money multiplier and velocity tell the true secular story it's so the last it's i guess two separate answers the velocity side tells us what's going in the real economy not the asset market side um if you want to see velocity in the asset market side um it's the chart of the s p 500. remember people say oh well we're just japan on a leg the nikkei fell for 30 years 25 years the nasdaq the s p is at all-time highs there's your velocity on on asset prices home prices are at all-time highs there's your velocity on asset prices uh bond prices are near all-time highs uh bitcoin etc i mean we have an everything bubble so the financial side of velocity uh the asset price side of velocity is very very high maybe it's shrinking a little bit with what we've seen in cryptos this weekend last couple weeks who knows but uh the real economy side the velocity i do think is lower but again you have to take velocity in my opinion with a big block of salt because it's it's just a calculation it's a plug of a calculation it's mv equals pq so it's it's um velocity times uh the money supply equals the price or inflation times the actual real gdp growth so we we don't fully know money supply as jeff snyder says we are under pricing or under managing under counting inflation intentionally to help save the bond market um we have an okay read of what real gdp is now that we are are you know hedonically adjusting technology devices etc so what's happening with velocity to me is is in the real economy at the lows is is marginally useful now with that said that's sort of one reason why you know that i don't put a lot of stock necessarily in what velocity is doing with that said uh to me the reason why i don't think it's transitory is pretty much what stan druckenmiller told us um on cnbc two weeks ago which i don't think people listen to that full interview enough and and i think they need to listen to it about the three or four or five times until they really hear what he's saying but the point is this deflation with u.s debt to gdp at 130 percent and with the us's true interest expense already over 100 percent of tax receipts and we define true true interest expense as interest expense plus or excuse me treasury spending plus entitlement pay as you goes up if you have deflation in that environment like these guys are looking for the us will miss interest payments on treasuries they will call treasury holders and say we're not making the payment this month unless the fed prints the money um or they'll call all uh baby boom generation say we're not making the payments on entitlements this month unless the fed prints the money and so in other words the the u.s has a balance of payments problem because foreigners the debt is so high and foreigners are not buying enough of it and i think those are the two things these these gentlemen respectfully are all missing um deflation's not a policy option anymore given that level of debt given the lack of foreign buying and what will happen if you do have deflation is the treasury market will sell off with deflation and that was speculative on my part up until march 2020. remember the treasury market crashed alongside equities in march of 2020 after a brief period where it rose and then crashed um in october 2020 we saw the s p e and the nasdaq fall six seven percent on renewed coveted fears tlt was down that week uh a couple weeks ago we saw stocks off sharply tlt was down and tlt is down that means yields are going up so you i don't that's to me is ultimately the issue uh deflation is not a policy option given our debt levels and given the lack of foreign buying a treasury so it's not to say you can't have it in small drugs and drabs clearly we have that in march of 2020 october 2020 earlier uh this this month in in asset markets but the fed's not going to let it happen for long and that's where we differ so with that i'm going to wrap it up for the night i wanted to say thank you for everyone for joining us as always check us out at fftt-llc.com for more information on what we're up to more information about tree rings and that way you can read real time uh some of the things we're writing like what uh highlighted earlier as it related to bitcoin a week and a half ago so at any rate everybody have a great rest of the night a great week and we will talk with you guys soon take care everybody [music] [applause] [music] [applause] you

you are uh before we jump in here just wanted to highlight a quick feedback we got on tree rings uh from the weekend luke just finished this week's report incredible as always geopolitical reference and analogy to the siriana movie scene was so perfect couldn't be better thank you for your insights so now we're going to jump right into uh the uh thoughts here or the comments if you will from rahul uh hi lu what do you think of fiscal stimulus just passed uh will it lead to higher yields more borrowing which can eventually lead to a higher dollar or will it trigger another sell-off in the dollar i think what they are doing is is running the playbook from uh the august 2019 white paper written by former fed vice chair stan fisher and uh former swiss national bank president uh phillip hillibrand and bank of canada governor jean voy vin it was a blackrock investment institute white paper and they said in the next crisis we're out of ammo we're going to have to go direct and what go direct means is we're going to have a fiscal a bunch of fiscal spending and central banks are effectively going to cap yields to make sure there's no rise in yields that offsets the stimulative impact of the fiscal spending and so uh we are seeing them run that playbook and yes i do think we'll see higher yields i think we're probably starting to get closer to where the point where they'll have to cap it um and i think the most important thing to pay attention to here is um policymakers talking about keeping r below g keeping small r below capital g small r uh is the uh nominal interest rate that the uh that the us government has to pay uh other sovereigns as well and capital g is the nominal year of your growth rate in gdp and so you've seen this steady growing parade of policy makers economists and policy makers really since november in particular where jason furman and larry summers put together a paper they did a zoom call with ben bernanke and olivier blanchard and ken rogoff and but the bottom line is there's some pretty heavy hitters a lot of gravitas former government connections the gist of the whole paper was as long as we keep our below g then there's no theoretical limit to what we can borrow the debt position will be sustainable the u.s government debt can grow to infinity as long as r is below g and so when you start hearing when you when you when you realize they need to keep r below g then you start listening to things that people like yellen and powell say through that keep our below g framework um i think you can start to see a lot more hints that that's how they're thinking so to the next question from knox and also from joe thoughts on the slr operation twist and yield curve control going forward the slr supplementary leverage ratio for banks uh there was an exemption as it relates to treasuries implemented last april that is set to expire on march 31st effectively this amounted to um recruiting the u.s banking system into helping the u.s fed finance us government deficits last year and we're coming up on the 31st of march this is creating some uncertainty around the treasury market and as a result around rates because if it's not this exemption is not extended uh it's likely uh it's possible if not likely that you'll see banks turn into sellers of treasuries alongside a lot of other people these days so um the my bet is that or my belief is that that we will see the slr exemption on treasuries extended um at least for three months i would i think they're very um reticent i think they're at least aware of the moral hazard that they will be implementing if they extend it for another full year i think if they're not going to extend it this is the only time they cannot extend it because by this time next year they're going to have all the same problems except bigger and so it gets harder with each passing year not to not to keep extending it so maybe they extend it for three or six months just to see if they can get out of it at that point but i do think they'll extend it especially again what we've seen in treasury markets recently uh yield curve control um i i think in this case is almost a form of uh or excuse me operation twist i think is almost a form of yield curve control at this point i do think they would do twist before yield curve control particularly given the negative rates at the short end as a result of some uh technicalities of the the treasury general account spending itself down over the next several months so there's too much cash trace chasing too few short-term bonds um and you've got a long end that's maybe a little rising a little more aggressively than they'd like so operation twist sort of fixes both of those or helps them fix both of those ultimately i think yield curve control is the absolute last resort and i think they really don't want to get to that i think they're eventually going to have to but it's opening a pandora's box for the fed and the and i think it's to oversimplify it people say well well japan did it and it was no problem it didn't spur inflation and japan's a very different animal um japan is is a current account surplus they have a massive net international investment position uh to the positive uh they have uh they're internally funded and the us is 180 degrees opposite on every single one of those metrics and so uh and in addition there is no massive euro yen market like there is a euro dollar market and so basically to me i think it'd be very hard for the fed to be conducting yield curve control in the treasury market uh and not have that cause uh spreads to begin to widen potentially sharply in the global euro dollar market so in global dollar debt markets around the world and so you could quickly see the fed having to go from yield curve control and treasuries to mortgage backs to corporates to overseas dollar denominated debt uh it's it's a very slippery slope and so i think they are going to try to avoid it as long as they can but i don't think they'll be able to ultimately and to me ultimately that means uh people thinking the fed's balance sheet could rise linearly i think at some point in the next 12 to 18 months we're going to see a non-linear rise in in all possibility if not likelihood next question is from jen thanks luke what do you think of this tweet and it's from uh from haas if the federal reserve is smart and i think they are they will let the market crash people will flee into the us dollar and bonds ten york would go down to zero to point three percent this will give them more ammo to print more money they did this in 2008 uh i think it's a valid playbook the one thing i would say in terms of commenting on it is that things are very different today than they were in 2008 so u.s debt to gdp in 2008 was about 60 percent today it's 130 percent uh the entitlement programs in 2008 were all cash flow positive in other words there were more entitlement tax receipts than there were disbursements that's now backwards that started in 2011. uh the u.s net international investment position was negative eight percent of gdp in oa today it's negative 65 of gdp and so and then lastly and maybe most importantly u.s true interest expense the pay-as-you-go portion of entitlements plus treasury spending is 110 of tax receipts and those tax receipts are more dependent on stock prices rising than ever given how how how what a big multiple of us gdp u.s equity market cap is and so my thought is that the u.s just stood aside and let them excuse me if the fed just stood aside and let the market crash we'd likely see before very long what we saw in march 20 which is at first you have the dollar up and treasury's yields down and then before very long treasury yields would start spiking uh the treasury market would crash right alongside the stock market uh followed shortly thereafter by u.s tax receipts as rising interest rates choked off the u.s economy in the midst of a deflationary impulse uh and so i agree it would send the dollar to the moon uh but if they stood aside for too long it would be you know shotguns and k rations time um because you would see problems in the treasury market problems corporate market mortgage market rising significantly rising rates in the midst of um of a stock market crash and that's just not something we have seen and that's a function of those those data was i started this reply with which is it's very different now than it was in oa so i'll i'll leave it at that answer at that from cs uh mike green recently hinted that bitcoin's achilles heel is that it is seen as a national security risk do you know what he means uh i think i do um i mean i can't i i based on his public commentary things i've read so i can't profess to know what he's thinking specifically on that but based on his public commentary um i think what he is saying is is is number one it's it's a source of dollars for china so to the extent that cutting off dollar flows to china um you know can be seen as as weaponizing the dollar against china china mines in theory around two-thirds of the bitcoin plus or minus and so that's dollars into china bitcoin out uh and so that helps china's dollar position i also think over time particularly the bigger it gets bitcoin threatens the dollar uh dollar hegemony threatens the treasury market um and and so it to me um that i think i think there is a big chunk of washington that looks at bitcoin that way i disagree i think um i think there are also uh a a growing there's a growing part of the um of washington uh and the establishment that is seeing dollar hegemony as structured post-71 as as a big national security threat um and and i've gotten into this in some recent appearances but just consider since china went into the wto in 2001 who's done better on a relative basis whose economy china or the us uh who's econ whose military has grown in terms of relative size relative power uh more china or the u.s whose global geopolitical clout has grown and economic clout has grown more u.s or china since china went in and so really since l1 since china went into wto the big winners have been china and certain washington dc interests and i think there's a growing realization that this dollar system has structured that bitcoin threatens um in in some way at some point that that mike is referring to maybe maybe something that forces a change of that system isn't such a bad thing and i think there are interests in washington and in the national security establishment uh that but i think think that way so let's watch and see how what happens from sebastian thoughts on gold the miners and the commodities more broadly both absolute versus equity uh i continue to like gold and gold miners i continue to like commodities uh near term i suspect that gold and gold miners uh may continue to underperform on a relative basis in particular um as rates as nominal rates rise and and i think virtually everybody's running uh some certainly consensus i won't say virtually everybody but but consensus is clearly running a post-war recovery playbook that suggests you don't own gold here and i think commodities probably keep outperforming in that regime with that said i think it's critical to understand particularly vis-a-vis gold and gold miners that we are not in a typical this is not a typical post-war recovery there is no other post or recovery uh on record where we're starting it on debt to gdp of 130 percent there is no other post-war recovery where foreign central banks have not added to their holdings of treasuries in seven years there are no other poster recoveries where u.s true interest expense is over 100 of tax receipts uh and so when you factor all these things in to me it suggests that while painful uh in the short run that gold miners have had a painful start to the year i just don't lose a lot of sleep over because the pairing of yield curve control and stimulus that we talked about before is likely coming it's likely coming soon every tick higher in the ten year is that much sooner that that yield curve control and stimulus combined is going to have to come and and that's they're really just trying to get increasingly negative real rates is what that's saying so um and that will be very good for gold and gold miners in my view so that's really what we're watching for as a catalyst for those two i would say also multi-currency oil and commodities means that we need a weaker dollar to have continued commodity strength in my opinion so well that's that's i think dollar strength would be the only thing that cuts off the commodity bull market at this point and then finally from michael uh is digital gold and virtual real estate the same uh in my opinion no uh gold and digital gold or bitcoin is is is how i look at it as digital gold both require significant energy inputs to create uh virtual real estate uh does not and it's the same as virtual gold and and fiat currencies actually for that matter too they all require insignificant amounts of energy to create it's a couple keystrokes so you go there on your computer click click there we go um so in my opinion a bigger picture a key to investing uh in coming years is going to be uh own what's more finite uh and and you can see michael saylor with the the macro strategy bitcoin playbook where he borrows dollars and buys bitcoin with it that's just a small concentrated niche version of what china's been doing for over a decade which is here you take the dollars we'll brought the dollars or we'll spend our excess dollars and we're going to buy ports oil fields copper mines gold mines etc finite hard assets oftentimes stuff that hurts when it when you drop it on your foot but not always some of it can be intellectual property etc so i continue to think that's uh the way you have to play uh this cycle given uh the things we talked about before with a unique uh atypical starting point for recovery uh and given what we think is the first bursting global sovereign debt bubble in a hundred years and so with that we're going to finish up for the night again uh if you're interested in following up learning more about tree rings check out the link uh there's more information there and as always everybody have a great week look forward to talking with you all soon and uh be safe out there take care everybody [music] [applause] you
Implications for a 60-40 portfolio of bursting global sovereign debt bubble & Peak Cheap Energy,2023-06-13 17:00:31+00:00,11,g1odoITqKO4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1odoITqKO4,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope everybody had a great weekend today's update is a is a classic example of life is what happens while you're busy making other plans i saw that france went up two goals very late in the game against switzerland in the euro 2020 tournament and uh so i said hey you know what i can do this at 6 00 p.m new york time instead of 7 p.m maybe get a chance to get some more of my european friends on the line and of course switzerland station epic come back to tie the game late and then i actually had to pause the game at the beginning of the second overtime period to get ready so with that uh uh uh prelude i'm gonna jump right in here so thanks for joining us today uh first from jp are the deflationists missing bank lending to the government and the fiscal spending side in a word yes uh lynn my friend lynn alden had a great chart showing the difference now versus 2008 where in a wait there really was not a fiscal impulse it was all being done on uh your qe was was was being done largely um with basically taking bonds off of people's books there wasn't this fiscal side this time there has very much been a huge fiscal impulse and so you hand money because the government hands money money to consumers the government borrows the money in bond markets as a practical matter basically borrowing the money from banks banks turn around sell those treasuries to the fed who buys those bonds with printed money and so basically two steps removed it's the fed handing money to u.s consumers uh just being filtered through uh the fed and the banks so washrooms repeat and that's why i think we've seen a much more uh uh uh much much stronger inflationary response i would say than we saw back in 2008 2009 second question from wmr gold miners market is acting like the first part of the 2013 decline a little hawkish talk from the fed and no bid for miners do you see it differently i agree that they are and in the last couple weeks have acted in that way um and i think that is really uh the consensus narrative that is that this is just 2013 uh all over again that we're gonna get taper and things will proceed as they did and you can't own gold and you can't own bitcoin uh i do see it differently though uh debt to gdp was closer to a hundred percent then not a hundred thirty percent at the gdp baby boomer entitlements had just barely gone free cash flow negative they are massively cash free cash flow negative now since boomers are on average uh eight years older um taper in our view is really not an option uh unless until until you de-lever uh the federal balance sheet probably back toward uh 80 percent that the gdp since we've tried it and they blew up the system trying it back from 17 and 18 is when they finally got around to kiwi taper we saw them get away with it for about 12 to 18 months and and then had to reverse themselves so i i think the narrative is the same at this point i do not think that the outcome is going to be the same because we are in a very different context tied to that from tb inflation expectations are fading tlt is rising how long before you capitulate the tlt is rising um people are definitely definitely noticing that a lot fewer people many fewer people is probably the right way to say that many fewer people have noticed that the fed's balance sheets grown 400 billion dollars in 11 weeks now the fed has said we're going to grow at least 120 billion dollars per month but if we run rate out that 400 billion over the last 11 weeks what we get is 1.9 trillion at an annual rate which is nearly 30 percent more than the fed's state of target so tlt rising with the fed buying 30 percent more bonds than they said they would over the last uh 11 weeks is sort of an interesting non-secret tour um secondly am i going am i am i going to how long before i capitulate obviously i'll change my mind as facts change but i think it's critical to maintain the context that i still see so few people maintaining which is debt to gdp in the us is 130 percent throughout the last several centuries only one nation has gotten to 130 percent and not defaulted on their debt typically via very high inflation uh for an extended period of time or a rapid hyperinflation and that one nation is japan and japan could not be more different than the us in terms of its economic setup their current account surplus or current account deficit they borrow internally we borrow externally and so it's just 180 degrees opposite of what uh and also they have a massively positive net international investment position so in a pinch they could call up the united states and say hey we want our uh you know 50 of gdp and investments that we're holding in the united states we want that money back uh the united states runs a net international investment position of negative 67 percent of gdp there's no one to call for the u.s u.s can't call someone and say on net we want our money back the money isn't there who they call is the fed and they've been calling the fed and over the last 11 weeks they've been calling the fed more so uh i you know if facts change absolutely capitulate if the fed came out in extremis uh if the fed could come out tomorrow and say hey we're going to taper our entire 8 trillion dollar balance sheet down to zero by labor day you'll get your deflation uh you'll get your dollar to 150 or wherever some of those dollar uber bulls say it'll go and the dow will probably be at about a thousand maybe 500 i don't know the dao not the s p so an extremist you you absolutely can still get deflation it's a policy choice with that said that's not a world um it's going to be a very attractive world to be in uh so uh we're watching to see what happens so let's watch as we like to say right uh from from larry luke under your black swan scenario where the us government has to allow massive upwards repricing of gold what do you think happens to the price of other metals like silver i think they likely go up quite possibly by quite a bit but i don't think they rise as much as gold i think it's important to recognize that gold sits on central bank balance sheets and so a revaluation of gold in this scenario will effectively be uh gold re-collateralizing central bank balance sheets and so that's the reason they hold the gold in extremis it can re it's it's nobody else's liability they can re-collateralize their balance sheet reset the system however you want to phrase it and so i would expect that the gold to silver ratio gold to everything else gold to all of their metals ratios uh almost all other metals ratios would would likely rise pretty meaningfully uh in that scenario that you've laid out that we've talked about a number of times in the past uh from prof uh can you please break down how banks lend to the us government and how that's credit expansion which is inflationary uh they lend they lend to the us government by buying treasury bonds um the u.s treasuries is a u.s government bond and if you're borrowing bonds from the you if you're buying bonds from the us government you're lending money to the us government in effect uh the question then is what is that money spent on and as we noted earlier this cycle that money has been much more has been spent much more on getting it into the hands of the consumer i'm not saying it's the wrong or right thing to do it was probably the right thing to do to avoid an economic collapse with that said i think it's important to recognize that of personal consumption expenditures pce which is uh consumer spending i've not looked at the data series in probably a month month and a half but recently u.s government transfer payments were 35 percent of personal consumption expenditures and personal consumption expenditures is two-thirds of gdp so us government hands money to consumer consumer spends consumer spending is the majority of gdp so you you watch the flows you just you know follow the money as as they said in uh in watergate if you follow the money you can see what's happening and ultimately uh in that case we just have to watch for changes to what's happening and that's a key thing what that we're watching for going forward and then the last thought here uh from max max thoughts on whether the government is currently doing enough spending to keep up velocity uh and keep it needed uh keep velocity up uh to where it is needed to keep nominal gdp growth up and what will be the first sign if it's not enough i think it's a great question i think at the moment yes they are um that the fed is and the fed and government currently are doing enough given the recovery in the economy i think the key tells to watch will be i think the dollar number one i think equity volatility number two and then i think uh elongated treasury rates number three and so if if the dollar or volatility start to really rise or break out above key levels and i think that's a key sign that that the fed and or government really fed and government are going to need to do more in terms of partnering basically monetizing fiscal spending initially in that scenario i would expect long-dated treasury rates to fall as the dollar and volatility rose uh but before very long you would likely start to see treasury yields rise as the dollar fell and as volatility or excuse me as the dollar rose and as volatility rose and his stocks fell if they continued to not do enough from that point so obviously um you know to to tb's point before the the combination of dollar up vol up rates down at the long end uh did occur last week uh with the mention of taper we've seen some commodity prices come off but again i think it's critical to understand the bigger context here which is 130 percent at the gdp we don't have the optionality uh that we had in 2013 2012 2010 etc it's a very different playbook they and basically a bet on sustained deflation at this point is a bet on the u.s government nominally defaulting on treasury bonds and or entitlement payments to the baby boom generation in theory that can happen politically i ascribe a very low probability to that happening and so it really becomes a question of path of how much pain is needed to justify the next round of fiscal the next round of fed active of action of monetizing that uh while trying to jawbone inflation to reasonable levels so with that i am going to uh hang it up for tonight i'm going to go down and hit play and see how this excellent uh soccer game between france and switzerland ended up i hope all of you have a great week uh for my friends here in the us that's celebrating the july 4th holiday this week and happy july 4th to everybody and

Thoughts on bond market deviating from the Fed; Views on timeline until a debt problems become acute,2023-05-23 16:00:05+00:00,17,9bodQZEoAh0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bodQZEoAh0,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fftt hope everybody had a great weekend uh another another browns win this weekend which is always exciting it was ugly but it was a win so we'll take it so i'm gonna jump right in here with the questions uh thank you everybody for joining first question is from max how are you cooking your turkey this year little thanksgiving and on our thanksgiving uh in the oven like always we don't do the deep frying um but a little bit more expensive for turkey this year uh as you may have seen on the uh the st louis fed uh tweet yesterday uh we will not be substituting uh soybean protein for uh real turkey like they advised in the fed tweet so at anyway on to real things uh or more serious things at least uh from ww what's your view on china i hear one there a gigantic debt bubble waiting to burst and number two they're buying up hard assets and racing ahead to take leadership in ai and tech very hard to know which is more likely i think both of those things are happening at once i think it's both a big bubble and they're buying hard assets uh with with dollar surpluses and trying to get a lead in ai and tech uh the whole world's at that bubble though and not just them i would say um and so in my opinion the keys you really have to look at real world physical constraints um i think what one thing we've learned since 2008 has been that all purely debt problems will just be papered over or extended and pretended and moved on from but uh and so what i'm really trying to focus on are real world constraints that can't be papered over so for example uh in the u.s u.s baby boomer obligations as long as those baby boomers are here um there is an obligation to pay them what they're owed and uh so that that you can't get around that supply chain constraints and reliance on china those things you can't get around the the boats are either full or they're not or they're backed up or they're not in china they've got physical constraints it's it's water it's energy it's food um and and of course all of these things are interconnected and so um if the the minute one of us hits a constraint somewhere it begins to flow through into everywhere else so um sort of a stream of thought there but i i think it's um i don't know that there's a black and white answer to that now from qr jeff snyder said that bond market always predicts monetary inflation and suggests there is zero indication of it coming anytime or occurring anytime soon do you expect to see multiple supply shock inflation spikes or monetary inflation if we have financial repression would the bond market even tell us uh i guess i disagree with jeff's premise the bond market doesn't always tell us uh for example from 1941 to 51 which is a full decade it's just a little bit on a chart it's a full 10 years of your life um yields were capped by the fed the bond maker market literally told us nothing it told us that there was a buyer uh political uh buyer of u.s debt that had an infinite balance sheet and a political mandate to inflate away debt that's all the bond market told us from 1941 to 1951. uh bondholders lost a massive amount of money on a real basis not not nominally they got paid every time they were owed but their purchasing power got crushed for 10 years there's another example november 1941 despite the fact there have been rising global tensions for eight years despite the fact that the world had been at war since september 1939 uh despite the fact that the united states had been supplying one of the combatants to that war since i believe 1940 early 1940 uh the uk uh the u.s tenure u.s long bonds were forecasting deflation as far as the eye could see december 7 1941 a month later japan bombs pearl harbor uh the u.s bond market yields back up enormously fed comes in caps yields because war is extremely inflationary so i understand what jeff is saying i agree most of the time but in these extreme scenarios of uh i don't know that the bond market always tells anything i mean there's something similar happening now bond markets are focused solely on the monetary side and the supplies chain side but they're only looking at the ports of la long beach basically they're not paying any attention to uh more structural supply chain issues such as peak cheap oil and gas peak cheap commodities uh they're not paying any attention to the historical uh data which hershman capital showed that uh 98 percent of the countries over the last 150 years uh that have gotten 130 percent that the gdp have inflated the debt away or restructured the debt a hundred percent of the the twin deficit nations so within content there's there's context that exists there so i like i said i guess i don't i don't agree with the premise that the bond market always tells us uh always tells us everything particularly in extreme times and i think we're living in extreme times from vt will we see sustained high inflation continued massive us government deficit spending while the dollar climbs due to global demand for dollars all global fiat is devalued but the us dollar devalues the slowest uh yeah this can happen but can only happen briefly uh we saw something like this in 2018 and then in 4q18 the stock market fell 20 a quarter which was one of the biggest quarterly drops peaked to trough in history um so why can we only see it briefly uh us net international investment position of negative 70 percent of gdp uh u.s stocks effectively are the economy now through uh the consumption link emerging markets are the majority of global gdp for the first time in 300 years emerging markets are the majority of global oil consumption for the first time ever the u.s is the world's biggest high cost oil producer which through the em link starts to make the us industrial sector look a lot like an em u.s shale is a key component of the ism as i said the higher dollar will hit the emerging markets and then they'll sell dollar assets they'll hurt u.s consumer spending through the dollar asset fall uh that will filter into gdp uh they will cut back on oil buying which will hurt oil prices and therefore us ism and so the lag on all of this happening to me is the sixty four thousand dollar question we're coming off a very hot economy and so maybe that buys us some time uh relative to what we saw in 2018 in terms of this rising dollar rising rate rising stocks uh combination the debt levels out there would all else equal make this shorter though so i i think it's likely measured in months in terms of from when the dollar gets quote unquote too strong to win the dollar uh to when we start having risk off higher volatility uh etc weaker us economy maybe two quarters at the most uh if the dollar rise continues so you know let's watch uh from brian hi luke obviously not selling any bitcoin itself but would you consider selling the bitcoin stocks when bitcoin reaches what we might what we think might be a peak in the cycle stocks all bought last year and early this cycle include uh mstr m-a-r-a hut coin and then uh the uh uh grayscale bitcoin trust uh i don't have a view on any of the bitcoin names uh i for myself i just keep it simple i don't know enough about those names to uh uh take a position uh with any with any conviction so i just buy bitcoin um you know it probably takes away some upside maybe uh if you know the names and can trade them well but for me i it also takes away the management execution risk i don't have to worry about that i just i want to own the bitcoin so i i take a simplistic sort of plain vanilla chicken view but that's uh uh you know that that is what it is uh from tyler going further on the jeff snyder lacey hunt interest is the real game changer in the inflation deflation debate mmt or ubi universal basic income and putting money directly into ordinary people's bank accounts look if you read what stan fisher former fed vice chair uh said in august 2019 what you rea what ben bernanke said back in o2 um december vote 2 what they did last year was helicopter money full stop it was effectively ubi you know we got our inflation as a result of it right i mean they they ran massive deficits they gave the money to consumers the fed monetized those deficits that is a classic definition of helicopter money and we got our inflationary the highest inflation in 30 years so the question we've long been asking this whole time uh is is will they keep this up how long will they keep it up will they keep it up they need to keep it up given the debt levels where they are but but will they ultimately since money is fungible dollars are fungible uh as long as the us government is running deficits and as long as the fed is doing qe that's helicopter money effectively that's basically the government handing money to somebody in the fed monetizing it in some amount in some amount um the question is is on the margin are they doing more or less obviously they're doing less uh i would agree that ubi would take it up a notch probably make it much more uh inflationary much more effective i think ubi and is is inevitable on some level uh at some point but you probably need political form in the form of a political cover excuse me in the form of a crisis and uh i don't think we're there yet uh that ties back to that how strong does the dollar have to be before things start coming on wound question from je and ec two questions here what signs would likely come before us gold revaluing and what actually would be the effects short and long term of a gold price adjustment overnight to ten thousand dollars per ounce uh and not for the balance sheets of the fed but for companies and households so uh i think the signs i think we're seeing a lot of the signs uh rising debt levels uh cessation of foreign central bank treasury buying um lacey hunts net national savings as a percent of gross national income falling back to 1933 or 2008 levels when you had uh dollar devaluation uh to sort of jump start things uh we got that last year gold moving back into the system on some level is reserve asset uh bis net stable funding ratio rules for gold changing in london uh to some extent in january that seems to be moved move a move to get the banks back on size uh you know as one of my best relationships on wall street says it's it's a situation where there's just sort of any given sunday if if no gold gold revaluation happens in the next five years i probably wouldn't be surprised if it happened this sunday night i probably wouldn't be surprised but i think you need some sort of crisis that that where consensus thought goes from where we are today which is this is just another rate height cycle with gdp growth uh to realizing they're not getting out of this without some sort of gold revaluation balance sheet recapitalization at the central bank level and we're not there yet i see it on twitter it's it's i think consensus is that this is a just sort of a normal post recession growth uh rate cycle and i i think it's i think it's very different this time it's not it's not different than what we saw um in other sovereign debt bubbles but it's been a long time since we've had a bursting global sovereign debt bubble in terms of what it would imply for um uh companies and households it would be inflationary on a lag it would depend what the government did with the money again the accounting of it is pretty straightforward per the fed operating manual if gold was revised to ten thousand dollars per ounce if the treasury instructed the fed to do that the mechanical implication of the accounting balance sheet entry would be uh the treasury general account would have uh ten thousand every four thousand dollars in gold is about a trillion dollars it would deposit about 2.5 trillion dollars into the treasury general account uh which treasury could spend however it saw fit and so how would it affect uh individuals and businesses would depend on uh what they did with that two and a half trillion dollars if they plowed it into one sector of the economy of stimulus uh debt forgiveness whatever that's where you would see your inflation and then you'd have a cantelon effect from there in my view and then the last question for today from wb luke do you consistently recommend a position in bitcoin do you recommend other any other tier one tokens i do own a little ethereum uh as a play on the on on sort of the web three uh theme about which i am still learning in very very early days uh and which i have no strong feelings about one way or another uh and i'm not even very educated about it at all so uh it's a very small position like i said i do own a little ethereum um but that's uh that's it so with that i will finish up for tonight thank you everybody for joining me as always if you like these updates check out fftt-llc.com for information on what we're up to and uh can learn a little bit more about our tree rings product 10 most interesting things every friday a quick synopsis of what we thought was interesting about them and whether they uh agree with refute confirm um uh different things that we see developing in the global economy so thanks again everyone for joining me everybody have a great thanksgiving here in the u.s and we will

"Consequences of rising deficits, large negative NIIP, & more",2023-05-02 16:00:35+00:00,15,dY2P3J8-SbQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY2P3J8-SbQ,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everyone luke growing fft hope everybody's well had a great weekend i'm gonna start off here uh let's see with first question a little bit light from gc do you think major league baseball should do away with the defensive shift uh i've asked my son connor to chime in on this and he and i both agree hell yes they should in our view uh either that or i i'm a big fan of using some of these uh speedy lefties just to just start dropping bunts down uh the left the the left field line there make the pitcher come off the mound especially those righty pitchers they're falling to first uh they've got to catch themselves get to go get the ball try to get the guy at first so uh i'd like to see a little bit more than that of that uh if they don't out outlaw the shift so we'll see of course i'm i'm sort of biased since uh khan's a bit of a pull hitter so anyway we're gonna uh we're gonna jump into the macro stuff now from ai any recent changes to your views on crypto uh post your smart lead deleveraging a few months ago also do you see a risk of an everything rally resuming with put call ratios up at high levels a dollar perhaps turning down etc or are you in the caution ahead camp near term so uh two questions there um in terms of changes to my view on bitcoin uh specifically no i still own it uh i have been buying a little bit back uh uh have also uh deployed some of those games gains uh from back then into some other hard assets for my family uh in the ensuing a couple of months uh likely we'll be buying bit more bitcoin in coming weeks um regarding the second question the everything rally i had not seen the elevated put call ratios that's usually a good tactical contra tactical indicator in other words people are buying more insurance on downside than they are on upside and usually at least in near terms those are signs of some near term potential upsides upside in the indices more structurally i think we're coming to a key moment the fed's either going to go ahead with tape or they're not and for those trading month to month uh they've got to care about that um i i i i i don't trade my own capital month to month um and so for me i'm really focused on that more structural dynamic and the structural dynamics suggests the only way out of this in terms of these levels of debt globally and in the us is the continued more qe more fiscal spending married together uh for longer and perhaps bigger than consensus thanks and i continue to be positioned in that way uh from wy when you sold some bitcoin before it dropped did you use some of the proceeds to pay off your mortgage uh yes to be blunt technically uh if you look at it from a pure um i don't know some of the bitcoin maxies would tell me it's not smart uh judging by historical bitcoin returns relative to housing i would agree with them uh i think from a political standpoint though uh which is how i was looking at it from political economics uh housing uh real estate is a politically acceptable inflation hedge bitcoin uh is not as we've seen from some of the rhetoric from certain policy makers in recent months um i i didn't want too much of uh uh exposure to one versus the other the other thing too and it's just sort of philosophical which is if if you're in debt you're truly not you can fully in control of your own life uh once you're out of debt uh or largely out of debt um you're you you're you're you're much more free and practically speaking it doesn't really change anything day to day for me it's more quite to be blended with a nice feeling so um i the other thought process on that too was really um worst case if bitcoin is regulated away if something happened to it in the shore and in the long run i don't think there's a lot they can the regulators can do about it uh for reasons a number of the bitcoin folks have talked about a lot but in the short run um from a regulatory perspective some of that risk i figured worst case um you know you get a lot of the house paid off and that uh that's not a bad thing so from spock do you think the fed will actually taper in the next six months or so or use the delta variant and weakening consumer sentiment etcetera to kick the can down the road a little longer uh in my opinion it's the latter i think they've got a window now with the delta variant and the indices there's a consumer indices rolling over in part due to those to say hey we need to push out uh taper it's not our fault uh it's delta so um i think that's what's most likely to happen i think that's a bit of a contrary view still maybe now with the fed going to virtual meeting for jackson hole in a couple weeks that may start to become less of a contrary view let's see from mike g you've said you to to expect real rates to be extremely negative going forward what type of political climate do you expect to see when inflation roars higher and posted rates never move to offset such would that not mean at some point politically negative real rates not being negative real rates means politicians not being re-elected which would mean that at some point responding to very negative rates might become a political necessity negative real rates in my opinion we're seeing it how they can manage that process in other words it depends in my view how good the politicians are how good the propaganda is how distracted the populace is so if the politicians are tactful and the propaganda is good and repeated enough inflation is transitory inflation is transitory inflation is transitory uh and the population is distracted sufficiently uh by fear or by divisive rhetoric or uh by other uh soft issues uh uh social issues uh then i think they can get away with it for quite some time and i think the other thing to think about in this is it's a sub-optimal situation but at this point they're all sub-optimal choices and so it's really is trying to do this likely to pose in this being negative significantly negative real rates high inflation is that going to pose more political risk to the politicians or uh will it will will cutting entitlements and implementing austerity on the populace pose more risk to the politicians in the more immediate term and i think the answer is um highly likely that it's much more the much bigger political risk to politicians getting reelected is to try to implement some sort of austerity so i i think they're going to kind of keep running this playbook of kick the can down the road uh inflate it away tell you they're not inflating it away and see how long people will believe it or remain distracted to not really notice and so far so good uh they've done a nice job uh from sam with the feds looking to taper in the next couple quarters would it be a good idea to short 20-year treasury bonds uh in my opinion no i would not short treasuries except for the finance 101 way which is borrow the money at a fixed rate for as long a period of time as you can not too much money uh on some sort of productive asset uh ideally that's cash flow positive something like farmland or some sort of niche real estate that you could rent out to somebody else a beach house or or rental properties things like that from ct will basel iii net stable funding ratio for gold be fully implemented to remove precious metals derivatives risk from the banking system or will it be sidestepped with uh exceptions that's a key question i don't know um i had hoped yes uh the lbma carve outs that we saw rolled out i think it was about a month month and a half ago uh they that that's the was that was first indication that maybe they will um basically carve out things and and reduce the effectiveness of it i just don't i've not seen enough information yet to have a great i uh a great feeling for it both alistair mcclod and my friend bob coleman have been have written pieces noting that you're still moving towards a more physically driven market it's just happening more slowly with these carve outs and so hopefully that remains the case obviously anything that reduces unallocated gold leverage over time should be good news for gold prices basically if you if you stop letting the increase in unallocated gold be the release valve for gold demand uh then the price of gold starts to be the release valve for gold demand so let's let's see how that plays from here uh from bf can the usa afford another war given our debt levels assuming a bad escalation in a major area not some skirmish i'm talking broad-scale war in the mideast the short answer is yes uh we can print the money so in my view it would be a question of how bad the inflation would be the worst case would be a hot war with china in my view and fed prints the money for the war effort but china stops the boats china's ports stopped shipping to america and if that happened then u.s store shelves would probably go empty within weeks if not days uh while the fed is printing money or or the government's spending money and the fed's buying the debt which is effectively printing money that's earned ben bernanke's helicopter money uh that's what we did for the last 12 months up till april uh april or may excuse me at any rate uh you'd be talking about borderline hyperinflation in some areas in the united states in those cases uh and so when i kind of talked through it out loud i i think you're you're the premise of your question i think is valid which is in my opinion the combination of very stretched supply chains uh many of which go back to china who in theory might be an adversary under said circumstance along with the levels of debt outstanding let's say they would definitely would reduce some of the optionality you'd have to put severe economic rationing in place in the united states you'd have to have some sort of manhattan project to ramp up industrial capacity all of these things would be extraordinary inflationary the good news is is the debt would get inflated away remarkably quickly it'd be great news for basically everybody but debt holders so um it's interesting question i appreciate it uh from mh is afghanistan um is the afghanistan pull out part of a larger trade quote-unquote trade taking place between u.s lead west and eurasia political black eyes aside timing along with nordstrom 2 and other big ticket moving parts seems very relevant it's a great question i don't know i suppose it it possibly could be it definitely seems to have driven even in the past week week and a half a significant change in perception happening even amongst the um what i uh friends of mine that i would lump into the you know king dollar because of our us military crowd on finn twit hey we're we're the reserve currency and it'll always be king dollar uh because of our military and i think our military is still very very good i also think that you're uh to me it changes it should change perception in a way and what i how i would phrase this is is it would seem that any great power competition war would quickly go nuclear and so then it turns into a question of who's got more nukes uh and i say that because um the tactical conventional side obviously uh guerrilla wars are really hard to win um which is ironic that we have to keep learning that as a nation that was founded by defeating the world's greatest empire in a guerrilla war separate issue uh but that's the side of it that i'm watching more is really just this this view that basically if the only war possible is a is a nuclear war that's uninvestible so then we can say okay the power dynamics that existed prior to two weeks ago in people's mind and the perception are they shifting and i think i think i think your points will take and i think they might very well be i think there might be some other things at work when you look at nordstrom 2 for example the us backed down after 15 years of trying to stop this thing is that because there is a fossil fuel supply issue coming up in two or three years and asking our allies in europe to freeze in the dark is not a political def politically defensible position i think there's something to that that we're looking at some fossil fuel supply shortages potentially or supply issues supply demand issues in certain areas as we look out two to three years so we'll see peak cheap oil is something we've been writing about uh quite a bit in recent months for example okay next question uh let's see uh two last questions do you envisage a situation where the us breaks apart in a similar manner as the ussr with states becoming individual entities or perhaps a two separate federations of states a sort of right and left leaning no um i don't think so i am seeing the political fragmentation happen in real time i think we all are um i think it's sad to see and i don't even think it's within states i mean it is between certain states but i've seen it in families communities and it's unfortunate so i don't i don't think it gets that bad but i i do think that there's some political disruption uh that could really come to a head in coming weeks in the united states with the uh the vaccine mandates uh coming to a head in a number of places around the country uh and then the last question the reverse repo thoughts on that yeah the way i think about the reverse repo is it's effectively um an enron-like special purpose vehicle uh to help the u.s uh help the fed help the banks finance the government without while keeping the banks uh in regulatory compliance with basel iii and what i mean by that is if you this is dating myself a little bit for those of you that remember enron uh back in the late 90s and 2000s they one of the things they were doing is every quarter end they would have these barges i remember and they would they would repo the barges back to one of their brokers uh and so the the bro the barges would be off balance sheet at quarter end and then they'd come right back on uh on the first day of the next quarter uh and so it the balance sheet looked better than it was is the point and the point here is is if we just look at the flows if government spends the money treasury issues treasuries to uh sterilize those flows to some degree banks u.s banks buy a good chunk of those treasuries the fed buys those treasuries off the banks that creates reserves that's fine however once bank reserves hit a certain level that begins to be a problem for the banks under basel iii uh and so when the fed does the reverse repo they reverse the repo reverse repo treasuries back to the banks to sterilize the reserves that were just created by the fed buying the treasuries from the banks and i have it on very good account that that's all off balance sheet those reverse repos are off balance sheets so the banks are in compliance with basel iii the treasuries are still getting placed with no disruption the government's getting their money everybody's happy what could possibly go wrong so for me i don't think reverse repo is necessarily the um deflationary impact that some have said i think it's more a financial engineering at the sovereign level to continue the inflationary uh financing of the us government deficits by the fed in the u.s banking system so with that i want to thank everybody for joining me for tonight it's always great catching up with you as always if you're interested in getting more of these types of updates check out fftt-llc.com for information about our tree rings product 10 most interesting things different uh synopsis of each lots

"Oil supply/demand thoughts, Did inflation help US Unfunded Liabilities",2023-04-17 16:00:14+00:00,21,LM2USFaoc2Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM2USFaoc2Q,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope you had a great weekend i know i had a great weekend it is a great day to be a cincinnati bearcat my my bearcats are in the college football playoff it was uh highlighted after taking care of business in the aac championship game so shout out to uh my friend chase taylor pinecone macro who's a university of houston guy we got to hang out at the cincinnati game on saturday as you may have seen on twitter so it's fun catching up and uh with that we are going to jump in so first questions from pm can the fed taper to zero bond and mbs purchases per month in 2022 while keeping their balance sheet steady neither purchasing nor selling and why couldn't that be a sustainable situation for markets into perpetuity uh i think it depends on context uh if the dollar is falling if inflation in the us is running call it six to seven percent just to pick a a high but not too too high number uh nominal gdp running ten percent uh i think they could do what you uh describe uh you would have the following dollar you'd have strong growth and that would allow the emerging markets uh rest of world and global private sector uh to have the capacity to finance what are expected to be a trillion seven 1.7 trillion in deficits now the challenge of course is uh is the private sector going to want to buy um uh treasuries at uh yielding one and a half when inflation's running six to seven the answer's probably no but the official sector uh might have to to soften their currency uh relative to the dollar keep their currencies from getting too strong against the dollar however another context if china's slowing if the dollar is strengthening um emerging markets are going to be slowing us gdp will be softening uh deficits are likely to widen from the trillion seven and estimated deficits for 2022. uh and then who buys them your emerging markets your rest of world they're going to be selling uh treasuries in all likelihood to prop up their currencies um fed's balance sheet or one of two things gonna happen either the fed's balance sheets gonna go up or u.s treasury rates are going to go up uh simply a simple supply demand equation solved by either the fed's balance sheet going up or uh interest rates going up so there are a few few potential offsets to that the reverse repo you know has a trillion five in cash if some of that cash dollar liquidity makes its way into the system that could be an offset conceivably uh as we've talked about before standing repo facility and and uh foreign swap lines also could help provide dollar liquidity offsets but those are really just qe without calling it qe so uh next question from hume how much inflation does the us need to shrink their debt and over what time frame uh earl the way we've looked at it is is uh we compared it to 1946 where post world war ii debt the gdp was 110 the us got it down to uh about 60 percent over five years or a 50 50 percentage point reduction over five years so we ran a simplistic model earlier this year assumed 130 percent that the gdp down to 80 percent in five years with 8.75 percent kager growth in the underlying debt which is what it's been for the united states since 1208 continuing throughout that period of time and what we concluded was that you needed 17 to 20 percent g excuse me inflation annually for five years uh to deliver 50 50 points uh that quickly um you could do it faster with more inflation of course you could do it slower with less inflation either way bonds get killed on a real basis now interestingly you can make the point look luke we've gone from 135 to 122 percent with cpi peaking at six percent and that's a good point in theory uh maybe it would only take six percent per year for another three or four years uh to get us there um i would argue that the six percent's probably not the right number um you know when used carb prices in the united states are sixty percent six zero um i question if inflation's really running at six but that's neither here nor there um uh the the what it does say is you know fifteen to twenty percent inflation maybe that's negotiable maybe it's ten to fifteen maybe it's eight to twelve um uh but all of those numbers are way above current yields on treasuries and so again you're going to put pressure on the other side for the fed to cap yields if you try that that output either way they're very high rates of inflation relative to what we're used to for an extended period of time uh from bc will european countries be forced to buy treasuries will the u.s use its military dominance in order to enforce treasury buying among allies uh the europeans have already played that role for us they uh they essentially stopped they were they were the biggest marginal financers of the us in the 60s and 70s into the 80s uh alongside japan uh post euro lodge uh they the eu all but stopped buying treasuries those surpluses the surplus nations of in places like germany in particular were redirected away to the eurozone uh and so the u.s needed a new financier after the euro was launched in 1999 the u.s needed a new financier uh enter china uh china gets into the wto at the end of 2001. um at the end of 2001 china held 60 billion dollars with a b in treasuries 10 years later they owned 1.3 trillion dollars in treasuries however china all but stopped buying treasuries on a net basis in 2014. same story as 99 u.s needs a new financier who is it uh since 2014 one of if not the biggest marginal foreign financier of the united states have been what uh my friend chris hamilton at economic economica calls the blicks b-l-i-c-s uh belgium luxembourg ireland the cayman islands and switzerland tax tax havens and hedge funds has been the biggest marginal source of foreign demand for treasuries since china all but stopped buying on a net basis in 2014 and so you say okay how many treasuries can the cayman islands buy the hedge funds stored on the cayman islands can buy a lot and they have or not stored but domiciled on the cayman islands so the u.s here again needs a new foreign financier in theory it's not the eu it's not china japan's doing what they can do but they're probably not good for the size of deficits will run on an annualized basis maybe africa but then if africa does it the u.s needs to run major deficits against africa to supply them the dollars to buy the treasuries it's unclear to me what we would run deficits in those amounts against africa in uh and at any rate china has spent the last 10 years taking the dollars we sent them and buying up lots of africa so i don't know that the africans would even be interested in doing so india not running big enough deficits mars you know maybe that's why elon musk wants to go there i don't know um but in all seriousness the only balance sheet left the fed and so that's what we've seen i think we're just going to continue to go through iterations of that until that becomes more widely understood when you say can the military fine force people i think that's always been sort of the game uh it's a you know protection question is protection from whom first it was protection from the soviets that's not needed anymore in theory it's needed against the russians i don't know that that's the case then you need protection against terrorism uh then you do we need protection against china hard to make that case when china is most of these countries biggest trade partner not the united states and at any rate if we're going to expand the military who's going to who's going to finance that same problem as before only the fed okay kw a common argument against owning gold is that in the exact time you want it most when the fed revalues it the government will deem it illegal to own right before they do the revaluation make you sell it to them i.e 1933. what are your thoughts on this potential scenario repeating uh in my opinion that's unlikely uh so for example in 33 and in 1914 when gold was seized in the u.s and around the world uh it was money it's private property now if nations can seize gold they can seize your house and quite honestly they could seize your 401k and your retirement assets where you know maybe there's five or 800 billion dollars of private gold in the us but there's 30 trillion in private retirement assets it could be taken with a few keystrokes uh in theory so i don't think it's very likely that gold could get seized now with that said i think if they were going to do a revaluation here too because it's not money they actually want i would think the governments would actually want you to hold the gold because basically you're going to turn around and hand them gold for cash you're going to take that cash and those depreciated dollars and buy real assets reinvest in the economy that's actually the whole point is you're basically the revaluation of gold uh is to re-collateralize the balance sheets of central banks write down debt uh if you seize the gold or you you you take the gold off people before then you sort of defeat the whole purpose in my view uh from sf your two horses one ass strat analogy at what point does the fed have to choose a horse i'm assuming there are a few different scenarios that force this decision what do you think that moment looks like i think the fed has to choose the horse when inflation gets high enough that it's a political problem before the debt is low enough that the fed can raise rates without blowing up the economy blowing up markets blowing up foreign markets etc and i think i don't know that we're at that point yet but we're moving quickly toward that point what i mean by that is all of a sudden the fed is feeling pressure on inflation inflation is becoming a midterm election issue the the republicans are harping on it i think the inflation is still largely a political issue more than an actual um hardship issue my thought is that it has to get to a real outright hardship issue where the first thing you're talking about is how bad inflation is at when you talk with your friends you go to parties at christmas at holidays etc i don't think we're at that moment yet i don't think we're all going to go home to the holidays and say you know the first thing mom and dad are going to say gosh inflation's killing me um i think that's where it needs to be but that's the type of thing i think you need to see that then forces the fed into uh choosing one horse from np what do you expect to see as signposts showing that we've arrived at the end game i.e next fed meeting will be an emergency one saying the equivalent that bretton woods is dead right revaluing gold china russia trading at gold trading or gold at a thousand barrels per ounce of gold whatever some of the cases we've laid out before i think the end game moment is a what would precede that would be a broad recognition that the fed and other central banks are are cornered uh that qe is financing rapidly rising deficits and that politically deficits are going to need to grow further and faster and as such that global sovereign debt uh is an asset class that is devalued is is going to be devalued significantly in real terms that it's going to be a certificate of confiscation for years to come i think that that has to be just broad overwhelming consensus or moving toward that as one precursor uh i think explicit yield curve control or its equivalent is is a likely precursor where um you know you have consensus arrive at the conclusion that real rates are heading towards negative 15 to 20 percent for a span of several years or to negative 10 to 15 for a span of several years and i think once you reach that conclusion once consensus is there then things move fast because you just can't store surpluses in in sovereign debt that has a negative 10 to negative 15 negative 20 real yields uh you have to move to something that preserves purchasing power and that that would i think be the uh precursor to some sort of systemic reset like you were describing now from oh oh are we at the end of a 50-year long debt a long-term debt cycle or do rates go up from dec for decades uh end of 50-year cycle but i think we're also the uh at the end of a hundred year uh sovereign debt and sovereign promise cycle um for if we take a step back and look and see what's really um what's really happening we look for the forest for the trees sovereign promises for the last 100 years have all sort of been slanted in one direction which is reduce reduce savings reduce personal responsibility in favor of the government backstopping you and bring forward consumption um and they've done that via debt via entitlement obligations etc and i'm not making us a political statement on whether that's right or wrong to do it just is now though the bills do and so rates going up on a nominal basis quickly bankrupts that system particularly since so much of the system's consumption tax receipts gdp etc are based on rising in rising asset prices most of which are uh most of those asset prices are interest rate sensitive in one way or another so rates going up bankrupt the system so in my opinion uh it it's more like more likely that real rates get increasingly negative uh for years to come until we reach a tipping point uh where we can get some sort of systemic reset or where some sort of chaos happens where a systemic reset is sort of the last last issue left and then finally from vb do you think that a central bank digital currency would elevate the system to the next level by adding new features to the money uh in my opinion as central bank digital currency effectively cuts out the banks uh it's the central bank effectively sending legal tender to citizens who would have a bank account at the fed uh dr lacy hunt he always brilliant dr lacey hunt didn't mince words about this development said that it would uh lead to hyperinflation uh and those are his words not mine he's very precise with his language that's not he's not known for being hyperbolic so i i think it would be extraordinarily inflationary now to the extent of what we've just discussed for a lot of the last 10 15 minutes uh i think ultimately some version of this is is what's needed you need some high rate of inflation not hyperinflation but some high rate of inflation for some extended period of time to normalize debt and sort of get the system back to normal basically resetting the system over the backs of uh real losses uh purchasing power losses by bondholders so um now i would also say that central bank digital currency would be a very frightening political development um and i was watching something by a presentation by my friend jeff booth recently where he called central bank digital currencies uh surveillance disguised as money and i think that's a brilliant um summary of what it is is yes uh everyone says it's it's just gonna be for stimulus but it opens a pandora's box where suddenly if you don't vote for the right people suddenly if you uh speed in your car suddenly it's it opens the door for the central bank to motivate or demotivate you via a chinese-like social credit scoring system uh where you get money debited or credited from your account based on behaviors seen as beneficial uh and that means basically the fed and the people control the fed have complete and total control over your life and that is to me horrifying so i to me i don't think a central bank digital currency is a good thing it is what it is so at any rate a little bit of a depressing note uh unfortunately to end on today uh as always thank you for joining me uh i appreciate uh you tuning in if you're interested in more

"BTC crack down thoughts; Challenges of changing USD reserve status structure, & more",2023-03-28 18:04:49+00:00,16,BwRX-PYoUP4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwRX-PYoUP4,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fftt hope everybody had a great weekend i definitely had a great weekend here beautiful weather in ohio particularly for november uh peak foliage just passed still a lot of pretty leaves on the trees and the browns needed a big win got a big win so it was uh it was it was a victory all the way around so with that i'm gonna jump in uh i really appreciate everybody having all the great questions gonna try to get through a number of them here uh in a succinct format as always so first questions from richard what are the odds that innovation does outpace the inflation dynamics we are seeing which does prove to be a temporary blip so that's the jeff booth uh price of tomorrow scenario which if you haven't bought jeff's book price of tomorrow i would highly recommend buying it and reading it it's excellent so what are the odds that innovation does outpace the inflation dynamics we are seeing which does prove to be a temporary blip what are you watching on the innovation side and what time frame would we be looking at for this to happen uh in my opinion the odds that innovation outpaces inflation dynamics that that we're seeing i think it's near 100 percent over time likely that uh innovation the deflationary impacts of in of innovation will outpace uh inflation uh the challenge within that is that global sovereign debt and really corporate debt any corporate debt that's being used for financial engineering right or being financed with more debt uh rather than out of corporate cash flows though all that debt requires inflation to basically not default over time we'll take it to the extreme so if you have innovation or technology driven deflation in the in the presence of this massive quantities of debt it's going to require central banks to either stand aside and let the system collapse let governments default let corporates default uh and let the chips fall where they may or continue to create base money at ever faster rates can continue to qe grow their balance sheets at ever faster rates in an attempt to which ultimately likely in vain a vain attempt to offset the deflationary impacts of technology given that a lot of technology uh has followed moore's law or is doubling every 18 months in terms of computing power for example they they can't create base money that fast without creating problems for the currency so basically what this dynamic refers to is either the deflationary impacts of technology which i think will uh outgrow inflation over time paradoxically require central banks to either stand aside and let the system collapse or fully reserve debt outstanding in other words basically put the entire or the most of or the entire debt market on central bank balance sheets uh print money buy back debt you're basically exchanging cash for debt you're monetizing the whole debt market is what these deflationary forces will in my view force the uh central banks to do with what they think they are in effect doing uh what does this mean for investments uh in this scenario you want to own base money like neutral reserve assets bitcoin gold commodities uh particularly those commodities um where the supply demand dynamics and the uh uh secular trends are very much in their favor energy uh peak cheap oil uh electric vehicles uranium things like that so um those are what i'm watching for the one thing i would say that could void all of this kind of thing is some huge productivity increase so um nuclear fusion discovered rolled out on a commercial basis to households around the country over the next two years five years something like that um it's it's a hail mary at this point but that's something i'd be watching for okay next question from larry chang can you expand on the metaphor of the fed trying to ride two horses with one ass what are the two sure so the fed needs to let inflation run hot to inflate us federal debt away down to sustainable debt the gdp levels that we estimate are around 70 to 80 percent of gdp versus 125 of gdp now um so that the fed can then normalize policy without blowing up the system however so that's horse number one is the fed needs to inflate horse number two is the fed also needs to convince the bond market that uh it will not inflate the dead away because if it if the bond markets get spooked that the fed's going to inflate the dead away it's going to bolt and the fed is it will have to be will either again have to let the system collapse because nobody from sovereigns on down can really afford much higher interest rates uh or the fed will have to explicitly cap the yield curve in other words they will have to buy all bonds at a certain price the bond market will effectively put itself to the fed and once that happens here again we have this situation where if the fed's the only effectively the only buyer and certainly the biggest marginal buyer of the bond market then the fed's not gonna be able to turn seller uh until debt the gdp has been reduced by inflation uh to levels where the fed can begin selling uh without uh blowing things up so uh you would likely see a very brief period six months twelve months of extremely high rates of inflation if the fed was forced into yield curve control in that manner so those are the two those are the two horses fed needs inflation fed needs to convince the bond market that it's not going to inflate things away from dc what's the best counter argument to the inflation narrative that you can come up with to me it's a great question the best argument against it is more political and by that i mean uh if the u.s government and fed decided to weaponize the dollar and the system against the world and in particular china uh we called it bombing inside the wire when we wrote about this in may of 2018 uh equating it to the movie platoon right where when they were overrun when the when the u.s forces at the end of this in the end of the movie and platoon were overrun uh they called in air strikes inside the wire knowing they would probably kill a lot of their own men but basically uh they needed help in the battle and the killing their own men was acceptable collateral damage to killing the enemy that was overrunning them at the same time so uh if the u.s government and fed decided to bomb inside the us's own wire to basically stand aside raise rates let the dollar run away and stand aside as the global economy collapses i mean imagine march 2020 except the fed never comes that would be i think the best counter our narrative and again doing that for political reasons doing that if if there is a um you know sort of a financial world war three going on uh and we really want to weaponize the dollar again the collateral damage here would be extraordinary i'm not sure it would even work given that nobody has more sensitivity to rising rates in a rising dollar than the us government itself given its obligations but that that to me i think is the best counter argument to the inflation narrative uh from jordan baker how would you comment on dr lacy hunt's thesis that you can only create temporary inflation based on debt-based money printing and then the last 100 to 200 years all 24 advanced economies had to go through austerity periods let me preface this by saying i think dr hunt is brilliant and i think he's been dead right empirically he's been dead right uh with that said i think also empirically if you look at history the rules begin to change once that the gdp goes beyond a certain high level hershman capital estimates that number at about 130 percent that the gdp it also depends greatly on your current account position and your levels of de-industrialization so once sovereign debt gets too high sovereigns can and usually do print when that's what's needed to maintain nominal solvency of the sovereign debt if that nation also has been de-industrialized by war as was the case after world war one or by trade policy as was the case in emerging markets um in the 80s and even in some of the 90s and in the u.s now if you print money to keep sovereign debt nominally solvent while you are running big current account deficits and while you have been de-industrialized you can also get extremely high inflation for sustained periods of time as i said highly indebted emerging markets have had no problems generating inflation since the 80s regardless of economic activity regardless of industrial production levels regardless of employment levels as the currency weakness induced to maintain nominal solvency of the sovereign debt while they were importing a lot of goods uh and while they had been de-industrialized uh can create a whole lot of inflation uh similarly you had a same similar dynamic after world war one uh dr hunt says okay he's saying emerging markets are not industrial advanced economies fair enough after world war one there were six industrial economies that were the six biggest economies in the world the united states the uk france germany russia japan um they were representative of some of the biggest empires in the world and in history uh of those six industrial powers in the aftermath of world war one uh two of those six hyper-inflated four of those six significant the other four significantly devalued their currencies um uh repeatedly in some cases uh generating high rates of sustained high rates of inflation so that is i think where uh dr hunt i think he's he's he's not factoring in where we are in aggregate debt levels relative to trade flows and political and geopolitical and real political realities okay next question from bb also over the last decade gold has stagnated and silver has fallen while bitcoin has gone from basically nothing to over sixty five thousand dollars if precious metals are a safe haven wouldn't money be flowing into them by now could things be different this time uh things could always be different this time i don't think they are i think what we are watching is uh look central banks and the world's biggest energy exporter russia have been flowing massive quantities of money into gold uh you can see that in the flows however gold is a political metal it is a managed market and uh gold has done nothing as a result of that we can talk about why that may be there are a number of different potential reasons why that may but prices is the ultimate governor and we can see it hasn't done much gold has not done much maybe gold continues to do nothing if gold continues to do nothing uh then either we have to have a draconian crackdown on bitcoin from the authorities uh draconian um or bitcoin is going to disintermediate the global central banking system and my view is that gold will ultimately continue to do very little until it does a whole lot in a very compressed period of time for any number of reasons up to and including the possibility that if central banks want to either re-collateralize their balance sheet re-collateralize and stimulate their governments without growing the debt pile they have to revalue gold way higher also if central banks want to defend their franchise and not be disintermediated by bitcoin without having the governments get very very draconian on things like the internet uh then again they're going to have to use gold to defend their franchise and when i say use gold i mean like increase its price very significantly and then the final question from ak uh interesting things from this week in no particular order huge u.s trade deficit number two gensler views uh ginsler video on ethereum three infrastructure bill four uh climate change conference numbers at 150 trillion dollars from both yellen and uh mark carney and number five yara and cf ceos both warning about food shortages uh you know the u.s trade deficit no shortage of dollars for china right and a very strong u.s economy apparently in the near term in terms of the uh uh the trade balance uh uh gensler's video on ethereum i did not see i need to watch it uh on the uh infrastructure bill i i need to look more into that as well the crypto provisions from brian armstrong that brian armstrong coinbase tweeted about uh i think is very much worth watching uh there'll be some more reporting on that i suspect so i'm looking into that looks like they are looking to have more reporting requirements as it relates to crypto so um i don't think that that's a bad thing um the climate change uh narrative uh in terms of the 150 trillion dollars it seems like they are setting up a new neutral reserve asset if you will um a new metric to inflate around uh if we if we have to spend 150 trillion over the next 10 or 15 years that is a significant amount of inflation that's a significant amount of bonds that central banks can monetize under their their mandate as we've started to hear the fed uh and i think the ecb as well talking about green being part of their mandate and then finally regarding the ceos of the fertilizers yeah i think it's very important uh i think you know you're seeing why energy is the master resource natural gas goes up nitrogen prices go up yields uh um they're talking about uh not uh fertilizer shortages nitrogen shortages as a result of natural gas prices rising uh nitrogen shortages yields down yields down next year equals crop prices up uh and uh crop prices up food prices up more pressure on uh geopolitics more pressure and pollen but also more pressure on this whole narrative that this is transitory inflation the the transitory crew continues to ignore uh some of the limits to growth type data we are seeing in a lot of very important commodity markets so uh we'll see fed can't print oil they can't print gas they can't print uh corn it's it's uh copper ores are getting uh narrower and narrower in terms of uh so there's there's a lot going on in terms of transitory non-transitory um that discussion is being held almost exclusively on a monetary side of things very few people are looking at it on the on the geological and uh on the uh the uh the logistics side of it but i think there'll be more and more people that are currently focused strictly on the monetary side looking at the logistics and the uh the geological side of transitory or non-transitory incoming quarters so with that i am going to finish up for today i appreciate everybody joining me and for the questions and hope everybody has a great weekend as always if you like

"Bank thoughts, Saudi/Iran rapprochement",2023-03-14 17:00:06+00:00,10,A2OXXo6HV8g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2OXXo6HV8g,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody sorry for the slight delay here we had some technical difficulties so um at any rate thank you very much for joining me uh for tonight another browns win which is always a a good way to start the week we're eight and three eight wins in a season for the first time since 2007. so that's encouraging so i hope everybody had a great thanksgiving break if you were here in the us and had a great weekend if you're elsewhere around the world let's jump right in here a couple things first off from jeff the us dollar breaking down despite a backup in rates and the lack of u.s stimulus that shouldn't be happening and it was something i tweeted earlier this week and uh uh metals are also falling equities are rising and so jeff just asked hey can you can you elaborate further and sure the the regime we've been in since at least march probably before has been that either not enough dollar liquidity is good for the dollar and so lack of stimulus would be good for the dollar and we've had lack of stimulus but it's not been good for the dollar we've also had any time that you have not enough dollar liquidity it's actually been good for u.s uh uh bonds in other words yields down but now we're seeing yields up um and so that's a bit of a change as well and those relationships that have been in place like i said since at least march and really through um end of end of 2018 so almost two years um those relationships are not holding um as you noted the the precious metals are falling as well oil commodities are up and so to me it's all indicative of a narrative that we're going to get a normalization of growth with the new vaccines that are out and uh i i've quite frankly been surprised how quickly the narrative has shifted from uh oh no stimulus to uh you know party on wayne party on garth everything's back to normal again um i can understand why i think the wish is the father of the thought on some level uh but that's uh in terms of the uh dynamic that i'm watching um in in terms of just watching this relationship break down um that we've been in place the last couple years where lack of enough dollar liquidity lack of stimulus is is is drives yields down and drives the dollar up and now we're seeing a lack of stimulus driving uh and we're seeing the dollar respond down and and yields up so clearly there's something some growth being discounted there why do i why do i scratch my head a little bit with it and that ties into a question from ces which is uh luke you mentioned that the us has a huge debt rollover in the next year but why does it matter if all u.s government debts and spending can be monetized by the fed uh via uh too big to fail banks and that ties into this point of scratching my head a little bit that the uh that the commodities are running um and the and precious metals aren't rallying is that we had a tweet probably one of the most most liked tweets ever last week but it just showed that uh over 20 percent of the us treasuries outstanding uh are set to mature in in under 12 months and so when you look at 37 uh under under 12 months the punch line is that 7.4 trillion dollars in treasuries are going to mature in the next 12 months and in theory if there's growth why do you need safety if there's growth obviously we've touched on the balance sheet constraints that exist globally and my point was just one of three things is going to happen with this huge bolus of treasury issuance that needs to be rolled 7.4 trillion in the next 12 months which is either the us is going to default that's not going to happen or the u.s is going to crowd out global dollar markets in other words they're going to place this 7.4 trillion to the detriment of other dollar borrowers other dollar refinancers driving up borrowing costs for them around the world we've seen this play out a couple different times that's been bad news for pretty much everything but the dollar or the fed's going to uh expand their balance sheet and or the bank their their proxy the u.s banking system will continue their rapid growth of treasury purchases and effectively the money will get printed and my view is that's the case uh but it's just fascinating to me that in the narrative that has shifted to that that we are back to growth uh very soon and and normalization uh they're not talking about this what has happened with the uh the fiscal balance sheet and as a result of coven and how that is going to play in so um i am left scratching my head somewhat that that um that gold is falling as fast as it has been um given what looks very likely needs to happen to the to the fed's balance sheet uh next question from rob what's the potential downside for gold in this environment and a follow-up to that question from matt this is a great question from a macro perspective what are the chances we're going to see 2013 2.0 uh it is it is really a bit of a puzzle at the moment um because you're seeing real interest rates at the 10-year fall uh notably um we saw real rates backing up right from august through about two three weeks ago that makes sense gold should sell off when real rates bottom and start rising we're seeing gold naked real rates uh uh get more negative over the last two to three weeks and gold hasn't responded so i'm scratching my head a little bit to me it may suggest the falling gold price may suggest insufficient us dollar liquidity and gold being the leading indicator the pivot uh in other words gold's falling now and in the next couple weeks we'll see stocks goal or oil commodities etc follow if gold doesn't turn around i think that that's a very plausible explanation in terms of what are the chances that to seeing 2013 2.0 which is a reference to what happened to gold prices in early 2013 uh i guess it was really second quarter 2013 you had a seven sigma move down so gold fell from uh probably 1600 to 1300 or 1200 in the span of four or five trading days it was just absolutely crushed to me it's it's always possible it's entirely possible what's the potential downside uh you're dealing with a derivative market you have to be cognizant of when you remove the collateral from the uh gold market there's really no limit to the downside that said uh i don't think another 2013 is likely this time and and the reason i think that is the things that are very different now versus that the biggest of these is that you have multi-currency pricing of commodities that is now engaged oil is being the marginal oil barrels being priced in yuan in euros you're seeing um central banks that are uh have been buying gold over the last seven years uh that was not the case up to that point in any real way uh and when you've got this happening what's effectively happening is the reference point of commodities gets shifted from dollars to gold and so the point is is that you basically there has been a process via multi-currency energy pricing commodity pricing more broadly where you're beginning to reconnect commodities to gold long-winded way of saying unlike in 2013 if gold goes down oil's going to go down and if oil goes down you can sort of put a bullet in u.s oil shale given the depletion rates there that then has uh implications um geopolitical uh etc uh and and bigger picture i think gold going down has a uh is an indication really of um not enough liquidity maybe more than anything else from od significance of chinese banks suspending new accounts for purchasing precious metals they appear to be preparing for volatility uh the 64 thousand dollar question in my view is why um are they preparing for um for a 2013. now i i sort of elaborated before that there's no limit to the downside for gold and what i mean by that is gold could go to zero uh the price you see on your screens here's how if there there are uh in london call it a hundred ounces of unallocated claims paper claims for every physical ounce that exists once that physical ounce is claimed if the market breaks uh basically if there's a run on physical gold which is what happened in 2013 uh you would expect that to be really good for gold's price uh but it's not it's bad for the paper price the price crashes we saw this again in march of this year if you remember uh we had this big crisis there was a a um with coved the price of gold crashed uh from whatever 1650 to 1450 in a very short order now remember at that point we all of a sudden saw these spreads in physical gold blow out to record levels 100 plus spreads that's what i would think would conceivably happen so that's why i sort of put an asterisk and i've sort of mumbled my way around this what's the downside in gold the the downside in gold um you know gold paper gold is theoretically zero because once somebody owns the one physical ounce once they've removed that out of custody the other 99 ounces have nothing back in them except paper promises uh no physical gold in reality that's not how the world works it's not how the world was going to work but you to me it highlights why it's so important to own physical gold uh not own paper claims uh because ultimately uh you would see a separation if there was a run on physical gold you would or actually run on physical gold you would see a separation in the in the price uh probably wouldn't take too long between the price you see on your screen and the physical premiums like we saw back in march so i don't mean to um be sort of uh a mumble or wishy-washy in my description here but i think it's very important um to understand that i don't think there's a lot of downside for physical gold um and i don't and ultimately the prices would true up but i think it's important to understand that um if you uh the the paper proxies we see on our screens as we saw in 2013 uh and as we saw in earlier this year um could could could fall pretty significantly for a brief period of time now this ties back to my prior point of as central banks have basically re-tied gold back to commodities through multi-currency energy pricing uh that we've talked about um that means it's and this is something i've tweeted about a number of times is is basically you know everyone laughs as gold goes down all those gold bugs it's all fun and games until it turns around and the oil market loses an eye because again they have re re-tied uh those two things so again i think that's a uh uh when we when we say what is china why is china um restricting new accounts in gold and silver they appear to be preparing for volatility i just don't know why but i think it's a very interesting development uh let's see from claude how do you see the chances of a deflationary bust driven by corporate debt defaults in 2021 uh consensus at this point obviously given what spreads are doing is a very low chance um and i i would probably say that is correct i would probably agree with that consensus of what is being priced by spreads at this point um it ties in to as well that what spreads are telling us is hey we have a vaccine we're all going to go back to normal i'm not convinced that's the case um i suspect they'll be winners and losers um i think if you are systemically important in any way you will get a bailout and if you're not you may actually be allowed to default and so that is how i would think about corporate credits at this point um ultimately um i i do think if i i do think you have sort of this implicit fed backstop as intellectually offensive as that is this implicit central bank backstop they have committed to keeping markets functioning um and i think that's a key to we wrote earlier to our subscribers earlier this year that the fed now has a third mandate it's it's unemployment it's inflation and it's and it's keeping uh debt markets functional so and functional is keeping rates at politically expedient level keeping spreads at politically expedient levels so i think ultimately this new functional mandate is here to stay and so um i i see a very low chance of a deflationary bust in corporate that defaults um uh resulting and then uh last question for tonight from mia your thoughts on what's currently happening with gold we talked a bit about that but then thoughts on rotation of gold owners into bitcoin ownership clearly i think there is uh without a doubt a rotation we're seeing out of bitcoin excuse me out of gold um to bitcoin uh i think that's largely happening at a retail uh and and and sort of retail and smaller institutional level um and and uh i do not think it is happening or will happen at what uh fofoa uh called at the giants and super giants level in other words it's one thing if we see um retail and and institutional investors some smaller institutional investors putting some money into bitcoin uh that would might otherwise go into gold my view on that would probably change i think it's bullish bitcoin i i i think that probably continues i don't think it's necessarily bad for gold um i mean i guess it is losing share on some level where i would start to get concerned about gold though is if i saw russia china or saudi arabia dumping gold uh to go into bitcoin that for me is when you see what i those those are what i would call giants super giants so if you see putin dum gum be dumping gold for bitcoin that changes the dynamic ultimately something i think a lot of uh bitcoiners are missing is and again i like bitcoin so please don't troll me but something i think a lot of bitcoiners the bitcoin maximalists in particular are missing is that uh energy gets the last word oil gets the last word and and by that i mean um if saudi or russia or both uh or they got together with china or china said this and said listen well we'll we'll we we now value physical gold at a thousand barrels per ounce of a thousand barrels of oil per rounds of gold uh that would be the new market and so uh to me i think it's really important to watch what the what's happening with the balance sheets of these super giants when we're having this discussion of is bitcoin winning is gold winning is bitcoin going to eat gold yeah at retail it is eating gold right now um uh it but is it going to eat it at the the super sovereign level at the sovereign level bitcoin has an energy debt and i think that's another important thing if you're a sovereign it's important understand that if you shut the miners off for bitcoin that changes the dynamics you have to keep bitcoin needs in ongoing energy inputs um to function uh gold doesn't uh if you shut the gold miners off the gold pile that you have sitting in your vault is still your gold pile so and i think that is something at a super sovereign level this giant level that they think about and understand and and and uh focus on so at any rate hope that helps as always check out what we're up to on fftt-llc.com if you're interested in finding out what we've been up to recently if you like

"Potential binary outcomes, and How does the US afford a terminal Fed Funds Rate of 6%?",2023-02-21 17:00:01+00:00,17,aXXHIO4q5lY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXXHIO4q5lY,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hey everyone luke groman fftt hope you are well i apologize for starting a couple minutes late was uh finishing up a lift a little bit ago and uh i had a hard time cooling down a bit so didn't want to jump on here looking like i just been running in the rain so i apologize a couple minutes behind at any rate i hope everyone had a great uh mother's day yesterday enjoyed it with your mom or significant other or that special someone and so we're gonna jump right in here on a monday night a couple questions here first from tgm how long until official yield curve control or ycc uh that to me is the sixty four thousand dollar question i think the frame that there's no easy way to say hey this is the date uh i think the best way to answer the question is to think about it in terms of frameworks and what i mean by that is i think it it first depends on uh the pace of certain economic developments so the opening uh inflation etc uh then i think it depends on political developments in terms of do we start pulling back on unemployment benefits or do we leave them though those in place do we do more stimulus uh what does that political environment look like on top of the reopening over the next several months and then i think depending on those two factors uh it depends then on when the bond market uh effectively when a quorum of the bond market uh begins to realize uh depending on how those two things develop uh begins to realize that it's the the proverbial frog in the pot of boiling water and decides to try to jump out and that's the moment that loss of confidence where i think you're going to see us move from uh to yield curve control ycc very quickly i i continue to think the maybe the most important thing to this framework is that it seems to my eyes and as best i can tell most economists and strategists are looking at developments as it relates to the fed's balance sheet etc as likely to continue to develop linearly and i think i i think that's right up until that's dead wrong and once once confidence is lost things will get very non-linear very fast uh and so that's the framework i'm how i'm thinking about it and and so i share that with you is just so as we're watching signposts if if stimulus gets really pulled back that moves us back from the edge of yield curve control if we have hot inflation readings and we do more big stimulus on top of that then that's going to move us closer to that moment where uh some quorum of the bond market says we're out of here so uh second question is uh jsb you and michael bury differ on whether or not hyperinflation will occur he's a smart guy why is he wrong in thinking it'll happen he's a very smart guy i think the difference here between he and i is in my opinion we're not going to get a currency destroying hyperinflation of the sort that we saw in say zimbabwe or in weimar germany after world war one and the reason i think that is because at the right price uh we can make everything we need that was certainly not the case in zimbabwe and in a real way it was not the case in germany so for example in the united states the dollar collapsed by 90 percent against oil from 1998 at 10 a barrel to uh that 2008 uh 150 a barrel and the aftermath of that is we had this massive uh growth in u.s shale supply another example if lumber keeps doing what it's doing uh there is a price of lumber where i would have to consider ceasing to conduct research and go out and start cutting down the oak trees i have on our property and selling them for wood because it would be more profitable so that is that's the type of the thought process now there are certain sectors where that would happen on very much a lag in terms of for example let's say semiconductors you need to build the capacity it's not easy to build it it takes time etc so there would be a period of time where the inflation could be quite steep and severe but i don't know that it would get to be currency destroying a wild card in this where you could conceivably have a currency destroying hyperinflation in the u.s and i don't want to speak for michael bury because i don't know if this is his case but it would be if you had a complete societal breakdown of the systems and protection so basically your supply chains broke down police stopped coming to work you couldn't get stuff then you probably could go through a period of currency destroying hyperinflation but again even then for a period of time at some point systems get rebuilt um to me it just you have to have a very um a very dire outlook to get to a complete currency destroying hyperinflation in the u.s so i don't know what he's looking for but that's ultimately it's that uh ability for the u.s to produce whatever it needs at the right price that i think prevents things from getting uh uh absolutely crazy to the point of a hyperinflation i just think we're in for a period of pretty severe inflation uh secularly over the coming uh years uh from cabs why isn't gold and silver lifted like almost all the other commodities i think it has a great deal to do with how financialized gold and silver are they are highly tied to real rates in the united states as a result of all the financialization of gold and silver over the last uh 30 40 years and so real rates have bounced uh off of the lows since uh august of last year uh on expectations of a recovery in the meantime there's been a transition over to uh other commodities that would be used and said reflationary recovery and so kind of the the traditional playbook for uh recoveries when you come out of a recession is you sell gold as real rates rise and you buy productive commodities commodities with a lower stock to flow ratio and that's the trade we've seen and the thing i think that most players are not factoring in properly is that this cannot be a normal reflation uh because uh the us that the gdp is at 130 percent and if rates get too high it blows up the government this has not been true in the united states in 80 years at least and so nobody alive has traded the last time we had a cycle like this and that's why uh ideally if i was a perfect trader i would have traded gold better where you sell it when real rates start bottoming you move it all over to commodities we like commodities not as much as we like gold that's been something absolutely could have done better in terms of positioning however my view has really been on this point that this is not going to be in all likelihood like the last of the cycles of the last 70 years real rates i think are going way lower and it's just not a trade i wanted to get cute with because if real rates go way lower to inflate our way out of our debt gold is not something you want to be selling at any point in that cycle in my view other than as a trade so i think that's what we've been watching in addition i continue to hear physical gold markets uh and silver markets are tight uh and so uh it's really tough to get too beared up on on gold and silver when you're here in physical markets tighten the way they are but i think it's really around that financialization and just this narrative that hey we're in a reflation we're in a recovery and that's what you do you sell gold you buy commodities so and then the last question for tonight from maurice uh what metrics can be developed to gauge if newly implemented bitcoin and ethereum futures are suppressing price at one at what point will unfutured coins like doj coin litecoin bitcoin cash etc become the new fire alarms it's a great question uh it's tough to tell in my opinion uh i think ultimately here too i think the best way to think about it is in terms of pathways um i i think the key to getting to a point where futures start having the potential to impact is is if you get to a the greater the depth the more they have an ability to impact the underlying in my view i think the other point too is if you have other instruments um particularly if they are cash settled uh sort of etfs which really aren't out there that much i don't think but um that's something to watch for and then i think as well centralization if you start seeing a lot of the bitcoin custody with just a few people so for example a lot of the gold is custodied with just a few bullion banks that makes that centralization makes controlling uh prices a little bit easier because then you've got physical on your one hand you've got futures with the other and you have a little bit more um flexibility as a market maker uh to push prices around etc it's not apples to apples because of how decentralized bitcoin is it's easier to buy physical bitcoin than it is to buy physical gold or silver uh but um i i think that's why i say there's not any sort of this gauge this point in time in my view it's more just watching to see how these markets develop i don't think they're at the point yet where they they're they're really controllable with futures uh and a big part of that is because the biggest part of controlling gold for example is out of the unallocated gold market in london uh the un unregulated if you will expansion of paper derivatives credit gold over the uh last several decades has has played a much bigger role in the futures market and so there really is not an unallocated uh bitcoin market as far as i know uh or other crypto market as far as i know in that way um you know to the extent you develop lots and lots and lots and lots of new coins and those coins get interest uh then that serves as sort of a uh a market that draws demand away from say bitcoin and ethereum uh in the same way that that unallocated paper gold or credit gold would draw demand away from physical gold but it's it's all a relative game uh it's worked for periods of time in the past i i would say but it hasn't obviously given what prices of bitcoin and ethereum have done they've not worked in the long term so that's the framework for how i think about it there's no one answer to say hey here's here's here's what the watch for and if that happens it's it's more just sort of understanding the potential levers and then if you see the potential levers factoring that into your thought process so that's going to do it for tonight as always thank you very much for joining me if you like these updates

[applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hi this is luke groman fftt hope everybody had a great weekend happy new year 2022 uh off to uh hopefully well it has been a very uh interesting start so far to the year uh we would say a lot of volatility so with that let's jump in here uh from the first question is from craig powell as head banker for all the private banks so far has used words to get bank stocks to the highs and destroyed crypto valuations big win for wall street how far can he push this before words aren't enough to stymie inflation and his actions lead to lower bank valuations to me um i think bitcoin i think i've said this before bitcoin is just the last functioning smoke alarm or free market really um and so to me what i'm watching happen to bitcoin uh in particular crypto more broadly uh i think is what will happen to the economy and the banks if the fed doesn't back off soon enough and so uh in terms of a signal i think we need to watch some of the uh i think we have to watch the high yield market i watch the etfs jnk and hyg as proxies for that and i'm watching for them to start really breaking down we've seen them start to roll a little bit but still very high levels there's no real alarm there but the thing about them is when they go they go so i think that's the first i think that is i think a key thing to be watching in terms of when will the fed's actions begin to stymie bank valuation so it's really when it goes from uh trying to stymie inflation to the actions trying to stymie inflation starting to cause problems and credit uh and i think when it starts getting uh when it starts causing credit problems that's when it probably starts to impact impact bank valuations uh next question is from uranus uh one will the treasury market throw a wobble again as a result of qt or is the fed's standing repo and fima facility stabilize slash centralize these markets enough for them to not cause a problem and number two if not the repo market then where can we expect to see signs of stress at the earliest uh to me these are very important questions uh thus far they're as far as as of last week at least been no uptake of the fed repo facilities in other words nobody's hitting those windows yet needing liquidity and thus far tlt the long end of uh treasury curve is having a very bad start to the year there was a great uh twitter thread uh with by jim bianco uh over the weekend on that uh total return long bond down nine nine and change percent last week it was last week would have been the worst year in decades for the long bond um at any rate it's having a bad the long hands having a bad year so far but the short ends have been very well behaved like i said no uptake no uptake uh as of last week in the from these domestic or foreign facilities uh i think it's been interesting that gold has outperformed uh long bonds in this sell-off uh if you would have told me that real rates were going to go uh 10-year real rates were going to go up 30 basis points in four days like they did last week i would have said god gold's probably down 50 or 100 or more um and it held in pretty well uh off the highs but still right around 1800 so uh despite those rising real rates so i think that's interesting um uh i do think signs of stress uh have already started um i think when you look at what's happening happened happening in turkey with the lira uh some stress with argentina and then bitcoin i think again is just a very sensitive measure of liquidity one of the less functioning smoke alarms uh and and one or less actual free markets and it's it's providing a warning signal uh it's saying that liquidity is being drawn withdrawn so see now uh the stock market and bond market sell off a bit uh and so i ultimately think all of these things will get worse until the fed relents uh the question of course is is how long and how much and i i think gun to my head uh i i would have thought a week ago uh mid to late 2q22 we'll see we keep getting action like last week and today it might uh it might be earlier in 2q22 but uh but let's see now from pm how many rate hikes can the economy handle and what would be the signs they've hiked too much two is it likely that raising 25 to 75 basis points over six to nine months could subdue inflation subdue inflation down to a more palatable two to three percent range and three how likely is a fed error policy here at this point i'll take the last one first because i think it's a hundred percent chance of a fed policy error because i think it's already started they should still be letting inflation run hot they should not be tightening so we're already in a policy error the question is how bad will it get um for me the first question how many rate hikes can the economy stand is the function of the dollar the higher the dollar is the less account the less rates uh they can tighten now the challenge is the more they tighten the higher the dollar is going to go right so if the dollar as measured by dxy is at 100 i don't think they can raise much at all i think that would be cutting if the dxy is at 90 they can probably raise rates two or three times and so um that is the that is the challenge there's two levers there it's rates and dollar um and and what how much they can do with rates depends on on where the dollar is at signs that they've hiked too much i think we're starting to see them already bond market selling off uh stock markets selling off bond markets selling off with the stock market um that is a big sign in my view that is that balance of payments problem a dynamic that we've talked about and tweeted about a lot over the last 18 to 24 months i think bitcoin turkey argentina these are all warning signs uh and it all comes down to when is enough enough in terms of uh the pain obviously not yet but uh things appear to be maybe accelerating a bit based on again last week and today so and last question was do i think raising 25 75 basis points over 69 months is enough to subdue a plate inflation again depends on what the dollar does uh and with the dixie at 100 yes with the dixie at 90 probably not uh additionally there's also a real world economy dynamic here that the fed can do very little about which is supply chain problems are getting worse again and my view is they're going to continue to get worse this year assuming things don't get worse with covet and some of the zero code policies in china uh with the geopolitics that we're already seeing start to flare up in kazakhstan and elsewhere so to me i don't net net i don't think two to three hikes would be enough to subdue inflation maybe maybe it'll temper it a bit uh but again it depends on what the dollar does it depends on what these external factors do the external factors i don't think are going to get better so i think they're going to continue to put upward pressure on inflation throughout the year uh let's see from ct where does one go in this environment with retirement on the cusp cash bad stocks overvalued bonds negative interest crypto heading south and when the rubber band snaps providing the banks are still open how does one protect their protect their wealth gold silver the game can't go on well the game will always go on in some form or another right so it's it's the as i am fond of saying it's what's normal for the spiders chaos for the fly so we're just trying not to be flies um bru if you've got retirement on the cusp um i think you want to be overweight cash for optionality in this environment because i can't i have very there are times when i have very high conviction what's in the macro in the short run um there are times when i have high conviction in the long run i still have high conviction in an intermediate and long run on how this game is going to go uh but in the near term uh the fed seems hell-bent on tightening and so my conviction level on what the macro outlook is for the next two three four months is very low relative to where it has been other times in the past so i think you want to be overweight cash for optionality i think then you have a blend of stocks some income producing properties i would prefer something that has a nice inflation hedge to it like farmland or maybe some niche types of rental properties maybe a little bit of treasuries just for some income for safety there again because you're close to retirement a little bit of physical gold and silver maybe ten percent and then a teeny little bit of bitcoin one to two percent no more than that uh because it's so volatile you keep your leverage low um i think volatility is likely to remain elevated in coming weeks months maybe even over the next couple of quarters ultimately though asset prices have to rise add infinitum to make the government's numbers and make the government budgets work so ultimately it's just a question of sort of managing your pile of chips if you will in a way that acknowledges that that that dynamic uh from latarro spreads for countries in latin america going parabolic chile brazil or argentina if those countries default on their debt due to restructuring or monetization how could affect the commodity bull run such as copper coffee etc several state-owned companies extract these materials to me it depends on how things continue to play out and what nations might do in response if they nationalize some of the assets mines etc uh then i think the commodity bull run goes goes vertical uh particularly the sort of offshore commodity markets for those nations right if if they start nationalizing big copper mines that's really good for copper uh in my view you're seeing some signs of that type of thing i don't know that happening fully i think there's been one or two but it's more seemingly moving in that direction when you look at some of the the protests and what have you on the other hand if they run what i would call the imf playbook the restructuring like you talk about which is uh they devalue the domestic currency they restructure the note and then effectively they run production full out of the commodity to try to pay back uh the new restructured note that has a uh can be negative for uh for the commodities uh to the extent that running full running production full out to try to drive cash flows to pay back the debt that then ends up being a bit of a depressant on on commodity prices so you have to watch how it would play out personally i think peak cheap energy peak cheap really a lot of different metals i think the underpinnings of the commodity bull market remain very fundamentally very strong um uh obviously we have to watch the demand side in the short run and then lastly from sp do you think powell won't cave to the market tantrums this time in the wake of rampant inflation and if he does what do the markets look like on the other side will he ever get out of the negative real rate environment unless he wants to cause the economic collapse that he staved off in march of 2020 he's gonna have to cave in my opinion uh the question of course is when right path matters so i i still think he's playing chicken uh trying to take some froth out of some of these markets but i've got a lot less conviction in that than i did say two three six months ago um and and less conviction that he won't try to tighten actually i think he's ultimately gonna have to cave but i have less conviction that he won't actually try to tighten first and and you can see this starting to show up in asset prices and real rates even in just the last week or two last three weeks you've seen real rates spike pretty dramatically here in the us and around the world will we get out of the negative real rate environment yeah eventually um but i i i it really unless he wants to create the crisis he avoided two years ago he can't do that until enough debt has been inflated away you've got to get that the gdp from 122 it is now down to probably somewhere closer to 80 percent at the gdp before you can get back to something that resembles neutral real rates without blowing up the global economy in global markets and if if they try to exit the negative real rate regime prematurely uh it is highly likely they will create a debt default cycle um including a number of different sovereign debts and other obligations so um it's something we have to watch for if they do too much it's good for the dollar it's actually been decent for gold um but uh it's not good for basically anything else and we're seeing that it's not even good for crypto it's not been good for bonds it's not been good for treasuries it's not been good for anything but cash so let's watch and see what they're doing how long it takes i continue to think that he will ultimately have to cave but he's playing his poker hand well for now so with that i'm gonna wrap up and uh as always if you're interested in in these updates check out fftt-llc.com

[applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fftt hope everybody had a great weekend i know here in ohio it was a beautiful weekend i was actually down in cincinnati with my middle son last tournament of the baseball season or the summer baseball season it was uh the wood bat tournament of champions put on by the cincinnati flames which is a pretty well known uh nationally uh baseball organization uh kid had a good weekend uh saw top level pitching uh i think three of the six games we played he played uh he saw guys throwing 88 miles an hour plus so uh finished up seven for 14 home run triple a bunch of walks bunch of runs scored so it's a good weekend so a lot of fun got a little sun so we're ready to start settling back into business so that gonna jump right in here uh thank you as always for joining me first question comes from david c biden did not mention critical minerals supply chain in his uh electronic vehicle excuse me electric vehicle push this week or ev push this week what are your thoughts my sense is that the us government and the dod and the intelligence agencies are very focused on critical mineral supply chains rare earths etc and regardless of what the president may or may not have said or omitted in any particular address and so i'll leave it at that but like i said my sense is they are very very highly focused on these supply chains from larry c uh update on your january 28th weimar check the boxes tweet we're only 20 i said on january 28th in a tweet we're only 28 days into 2021 and we've already checked two boxes on our weimar with u.s characteristics bingo card and i put in a a passage from the book when money dies is quote gambling on the stock exchange had become the fashion the only way to avoid losing all one's money and perhaps to add to it many new bankers were giving people advice the flight from the crone governing all transactions meanwhile the large numbers of unemployed their passions fermented by the communists are something or seething with discontent a mob has attempted to set the parliament building on fire uh for me in terms of where are we relative to that um and obviously that was in reference to what we were seeing with gamestop and amc and then also uh the the the capital the events at the capitol on january 6th for me i think history is continuing to rhyme but not repeat i think the overriding theme is something that we wrote about in our flagship fft report on march 11 of this year and then talked about at length with our friend grant williams uh on his podcast about six weeks later mid-april you can find that in his uh grant williams i think grant williams.com but at his podcast um and what we discussed and what we wrote about at length was the book 1931 debt to crisis and the rise of hitler and there's a quote in that book that i think sums up what we are have been living through and are continuing to live through here today which is that quote the economically possible and the politically palatable were at war with each other end quote and so what's the update political tensions appear to be rising not falling stock market continues to just chug ahead moving up bitcoin continues to trade very much like the german reichsmark in the early 20s which was uh up massively through mid april uh then down big in the second quarter of this year on taper talk on thought hey the dollar is going to strengthen the fed's going to tighten this is right in line with uh any sort of uh sovereign debt problems etc and how the currencies trade uh now we've seen in the last week week and a half bitcoin find a bid again on presumably delta the delta variant and concerns about that we are seeing uh to my dismay a shift towards authoritarianism uh in parts of the world where authoritarianism has uh been a foreign concept for a very very long time uh and i guess as i said that's that's a bit dismay and obviously it's being done under auspices of emergency then again you know it is an emergency then again it's always an emergency when these types of things happen and so you need to be very careful i would also say that some very very big things are still very very different now versus um you know in weimar germany and so i don't think that's the metaphor per se so i say it's u.s with some volume characteristics of the biggest of those is that as as much as the political situation here is increasingly dysfunctional intense it is nowhere near as dysfunctional as it was there you had um massive uh you you you had very high rates of political assassinations on both sides of the aisle um annually you know hundreds every year car bombs shootings etc so um god willing it's never going to get that bad here so let's you know i i want to be clear that it's it's us with some vymar characteristics and not the other way around uh from jp the only topic of relevance is why aren't you a bitcoin maxi yet uh i'm still very overweight bitcoin um one thing i will say that i think bitcoin maxies should pay some attention to is what is being done with vaccine mandates in heretofore non-authoritarian nations um i'm treading very lightly here i'm not making a point one way or another i'm simply saying that if they can mandate vaccines there are other things they can do uh as it relates to bitcoin that may also be very authoritarian and currently out of the realm of imagination and so we may be getting closer to that part of the quote-unquote fourth turning where being diversified into both uh what i would call state approved inflation hedges uh which would be stocks real estate in particular uh as well as still holding lots of the non-state approved inflation hedges which i would put in bitcoin is number one gold depending on who you talk to in the state i i think gold is a more approved globally given what we're seeing central banks do with gold um a more approved inflation hedge uh than bitcoin but i think that's something you know if there's a great quote from um i can't think of his name sir michael uh i think hence uh who said that you know you get paid for imagination i think it's critical to have a imagination now uh both on the upside but also again i think we have to pay attention i think we have to see what's happening i think we have to see things are happening that i never would have thought could happen six months ago 12 months ago 18 months ago and i think we need to use what's happening in certain parts of the world and transport that across to finance etc just as to see if to check if that makes sense to see if that could happen to think about these things as risks that suddenly need to be hedged that probably didn't need to be hedged six months ago 12 months ago 18 months ago so uh let's see next question luke have you seen russell clark talking about cycles around food inflation with grant williams and if so any thoughts on that i have not we did write in a recent tree rings report that in the short run the combination of drought conditions in the u.s as well as flood conditions and some critical growing regions in china along with ongoing global supply chain difficulties we've been seeing um in a number of different areas does seem to be setting up to support ag prices from a cyclical standpoint from a tactical standpoint but i've not listened to this this podcast with with russell and grant it sounds like one i should i continue to like farmland as a true uh a true inflation hedge a true uh bond proxy in other words you can own tips but you have to trust that the government's going to tell you what inflation is and and to be blunt i don't and that's not anything against our government that's just any government throughout history generally speaking understates inflation as a matter of policy particularly highly indebted governments whereas if you own inflation if you own farmland your your coupon quote unquote is going to be your rental rate which floats over time on a lag with crop prices so true inflation read uh the land moves with monetary the monetary base over time on a lag true inflation hedge and the other advantage of farmland is if you crp it and i forget what crp stands for uh but basically um the gist of it is the the carrying costs are extraordinary extraordinarily low and so for example uh before i started fftt i owned about 100 acres of farmland as an investment property i rented it to a friend of mine who farmed it uh the taxes i paid on 100 acres under the crp program were about 660 bucks a year so uh extremely low carrying costs so uh that's i i think um i think that's of note of interest uh from uh from max h consequences of the fed tightening into stagflation boy that's it's an open-ended question max you know for me when i when you when i think about that question the first thing that jumps to my mind the easiest way the cleanest way to play it is to be long volatility uh because i think tightening into stagflation uh you're going to end up with a slower economy you're going to end up with some sort of deflationary or accelerating deflationary impulse you could see some sort of a crash uh in in markets briefly uh the challenge is debt levels this high require increasingly negative real rates to keep the wheels on the cart and tightening into a stagflationary environment runs the risk of of taking real rates less negative or outright positive and so in my view because again this ongoing theme we've been harping on for years which is the equity market now effectively is the u.s consumer uh it effectively is a key driver to the consumer to tax receipts to u.s government tax receipts and therefore the gdp as well um or the gdp and therefore the tax receipts as well uh any increase in volatility that hurts asset prices likely will force the fed to do on 180 surprisingly quickly as we have seen with increasing um speed in in the selloffs of the last three years um and so for me for those with a with a short term one to three month investment mandate um i think it's a critical thing to try to keep an eye on i think if you have a longer term time horizon in terms of fed taper into a possible stagflationary environment if your time horizon's longer term you know i think it's hey maybe you hedge with some volatility but by being like some volatility but i don't think you you make a whole bunch of of moves because again if you have a longer term time horizon um you know i think i i think by nature of how high and high how high the debt levels are there's just not the appetite to have a sustained decline in risk assets by the fed by other central bankers globally and then the last question for tonight from mary c north carolina and south carolina are huge beneficiaries of the flight out of the midwest and northeast blue states but overcrowding and water shortages are appearing on the horizons to what extent will raise rising taxes to fund an underfunded state pension and retiree health insurance discourage the flight south are pensions and issue uh you know for me and i think if i'm i think i'm interpreting this right in my opinion if you raise in taxes um in the north i think it's only going to accelerate the flight maybe you can raise them in the south to uh try to discourage um some of that flight it's something that might work but it probably will be difficult to pass politically but again i don't have a lot of uh uh and when i say i don't have a lot of i have no intimate knowledge of the local politics of northern south carolina so uh i don't know i suspect they wouldn't like tax increases because most people don't um you know more likely in my opinion up north in these blue states are federal bailouts of these pensions either de facto or explicitly and i think we wrote about this in a tree rings a month or two ago there was some provision in biden's infrastructure bill if i remember uh or in the budget that that sort of looked like a bailout for the blue states pensions but but wasn't the bailout for the blue states pensions and i don't know if it passed or whatever but that's the type of thing i would expect to happen in terms of water shortages i don't think anything is going to be a big deal from an investment theme in the immediate term but i do think it's going to be more of a story over time if you look at american migration patterns over the last 20 30 40 50 years the story has been brought in broad strokes uh one of the populace moving from areas pretty close to carrying capacity to areas that either semi deserts deserts or swamps that are they were well above carrying capacity before and now they're even more over carrying capacity so there's always ways around this i don't know if it will i if the water shortage situation will become a bigger issue on an investable time horizon next two years next five years um so it's it's something i'm watching pretty closely a lot of people would say well you know that's it's malthusian and malthus has been proved wrong and um maybe that's true with that said if if malthus has been proved wrong i would challenge people that would say that then why do we need to be concerned about climate change right i mean that's that's a malthusian aspect and just with much better marketing i would argue so at any rate uh i've touched close enough to politics twice now so i try to stay away from that and with that i am going to wrap up for the night so i hope everybody has a great rest of the weekend and in the meantime as

[music] [applause] [music] hello everyone luke growing fft hope everyone has had a great weekend i know we have certainly had a great weekend here some baseball some track got a good uh leg day in this afternoon so we're ready for the week so i'm gonna jump right in here to the questions thanks everyone again for joining first questions from jason what is the timeline by which we will know that the expected transitory inflation spike is indeed temporary or perhaps becoming secular what might be a signal or two i think it's a great question uh for me it really comes down to watching a couple things number one watching the government spending plans as it relates to stimulus uh and watching fed qe uh in terms of its pace and are they buying enough treasuries or not if the government stops stimulus uh i think that's going to make the inflation spike transitory uh if the government keeps re-upping stimulus as i expect that they will because i think they have to based on the fiscal position they're in postcovid and the fed buys enough of those treasuries then i think it's not going to be transitory i think we're going to be in a much more secular inflationary environment than people currently expect if the fed does not buy enough of the treasury issuance regardless of whether the us government does more stimulus or doesn't do more stimulus that i think will prove to be transitory for uh the inflation spike because you're going to get either uh the fed uh uh not buying enough of more stimulus which means you're gonna see the u.s government crowd out global debt markets you'll see rates up you'll see the dollar up and you'll see i think commodities down eventually or if you don't get more stimulus as we talked about before i think that makes it transitory the second question is is can you from ss can you comment on the turkish move to restrict bitcoin and the issues with crypto exchanges there just as just a possible playbook just as possible playbook for the us and europe uh yeah i i think you know what's happening in turkey i think is potentially instructive on some level um obviously this isn't the first crypto exchange problem there's been over the last 10 years um in terms of uh of some issues and and you can kind of look at a number of those you know mount gox famously uh maybe most famously uh so i don't know that that's uh new unfortunate for those involved with that certainly but the thing i would say as it relates for model in particular to the u.s to a lesser extent for europe turkey does not issue the global reserve currency obviously like the u.s does the global reserve currency issuer has to provide for free flow of capital in and out of its borders that's the deal the us does issue the global reserve currency obviously and so my thought here is is there's a lot of talk about banning bitcoin these days if the us moves to restrict or ban bitcoin in any real way um they're going to be effectively putting in a capital control to a trillion dollar asset market trillion dollar plus uh that is going to be an alert to 45 trillion other dollars of foreigners sitting in the u.s right now it will be the first warning that the us will if it needs to put in capital controls on you they will get you in and and put walls up on your capital and so my take on should the u.s ban bitcoin or put capital controls on bitcoin i think it would be a galactically bad idea um i think it would be penny wise if you're interested in the whole dollar hegemony thing which i think is actually a disadvantage to us now as we've talked about a number of times but if you think it if you want to run that playbook it would be a pennywise pound foolish move um because again you would be alerting 45 trillion dollars in foreign capital sitting in the u.s you'd put it on notice that it would uh be at risk of being gated i don't think that's a good idea we'll see what they do uh from john f in your last periscope you mentioned bitcoins outperforming gold due to no unbacked futures for bitcoin but bitcoin has futures on the cme why does this not suppress the bitcoin price is it due to the bitcoin futures not being as developed versus gold futures i i think that's a small part of it is they're not as well developed it's a smaller market still with that said mo i think and we wrote about this quite a bit when when the futures first rolled out that cash settled futures uh does shift price discovery away from the underlying towards cash uh we wrote about it quite a bit and we tweeted about it you can find some more old tweets on that it is interesting that when one of the two uh bitcoin futures markets shut down in i think april of 2019 it is right around that bottom in bitcoin it might be coincidental i'm not sure uh with that said i think the bigger issue and the thing we the thing i would focus more on is there is no london unallocated bitcoin market anywhere in the world and that's really the big thing for gold which is if i wanted to buy a hundred million dollars worth of gold uh i credit gold i could get done now boom assuming i had 100 million dollars which would be a nice problem to have i 100 million in gold boom unallocated you're done 100 million now if i wanted a 100 million in physical today it'd probably take me a couple months based on what i'm hearing uh and so it's this unallocated credit gold market that does not exist for bitcoin number one and number two bitcoin is decentralized which i think is a very valid point that a lot of bitcoiners make which is in unallocated gold because of the physics when gold gets sold down uh because of the gold stores are centralized it it takes some effort to uh if you want to basically uh call bs on the sell-off in gold you've got to go to your broker you've got to get your gold and the reality is is a bunch of small small players can buy a little bit of gold and that could certainly drive it but the big players who could do it all in one swoop they're not going to do it for any number of reasons or they can't do it by regulation for any number of reasons which is to say they can't they don't like the price of gold a reasonable size hedge fund could go to comex and clean out a lot of the gold tomorrow if it wanted to it's not going to happen it hasn't happened the fact that it hasn't happened should suggest that there's a political reason there for why it hasn't happened the point here is that bitcoin's not like that where if bitcoin sells off sharply you have 100 million people with smartphones you can get on and start buying up actual physical bitcoin uh and that's a very different dynamic than what we see with the structure of the gold market so i think those two differences have helped describes uh a a big portion of why uh gold has really not done very much while bitcoin uh has let's see from cb you elaborate a lot around the need of real rates to go deeply negative for the us to remain solid do you expect real rates going deeply negative below negative two percent on tenure this quarter or this year the short answer is yes i still expect real rates go to go deeply negative uh 64 000 questions are when uh and and when will it actually be reported as such i could actually i think it's very possible we are below that on a real rate basis now when you really look at what's happening with commodities what's happening with services what's happening with tuition costs healthcare costs what's happening with semiconductor shortages supply chains i i think if you did an honest appraisal of what cpi is right now we're probably at negative four or negative five percent maybe negative three percent on real rates right now uh however when will it be reported will it be reported i suppose there's a there's a chance it'll never be reported as such but but i ultimately think it will maybe later this year we'll break to new lows i think i think once we are forced into yield curve control the u.s is forced into explicit yield curve control is probably the catalyst to when we'll see those negative real rates be reported uh toward the levels that i expect them to eventually reach um and so some of that is a multifaceted uh um you know when when do we get ycc i'll touch on that in a bit from uh oc what jumped out at you in the book twilight in the desert something i tweeted about earlier this week takeaways you found interesting uh first the the pareto principle as it related to oil fields i thought was interesting and by that i mean there is a very extreme form of the 80 20 rule that works in oil production so that was one is a surprisingly large percentage of the world's oil comes from a tiny fraction of the world's oil fields uh number two i thought was interesting when i read the book the age of those oil fields they are very very old and these oil fields all follow some version of a bell curve in terms of their production profile historically uh number three uh translating that concept to my thought that if i was the owner of one or more of those big oil fields i would not want to own a lot of bonds and particularly not a lot of low yielding bonds uh if slash when just a few of those very very old very very big oil fields went 100 water cut or went fully depleted basically stopped producing because the moment that happened to just a few of those fields the ensuing inflation would likely haircut those bonds in on a real basis pretty quickly so those were the the thoughts that really grabbed me most out of that matt simmons 2002 twilight in the desert book uh from kevin when does when does yield curve control or why cc become openly acknowledged and what are its short-term effects also is is pandemic unemployment insurance um the precursor to ubi and how does that look for employment in the short term to me ycc i think is a function of a number of different um dynamics at play number of different levers what's stimulus doing what's the underlying pace of the recovery uh what's going on with covet what's going on with the bond market what's uh the the short-term effects um all are ultimately all going to be a function of those factors how does that play out um the short-term effects of ycc uh i think it'd be inflationary i think it'd be very good for risk assets uh i think it'd be very good for gdp i think it'd be bad for the dollar um uh and uh i i think broadly speaking it would amount to basically the beginning of a of a debt jubilee if you will on a real basis uh by basically capping yields and and the price of a lot of other things going up uh against uh those capped yields which allows economies to earn their way out of their debt positions whether you're looking at sovereigns all the way down to households if household wages are growing 10 or 15 percent and and their mortgage is pinned at two or three percent by the fed you leave that for five years uh they're going to have a lot more room in their budget at the end of those couple couple three four five years um to buy other stuff uh and then let me see regarding the personal or excuse me the pandit unemployment uh uh insurance in my opinion yeah i think i think it is a precursor to ubi and i think on some level it is normalizing ubi uh in in a way for certain policymakers it's probably pretty helpful i do think in my opinion ubi will probably be a political necessity uh at some point in the next five years just given what's happening with technology and uh automation artificial intelligence what's that doing the job what that do what that is doing to job markets uh and so i i do think there is an element of that that is not to say that covet is some cover for uh normalizing ubi etc or any of these sort of these world economic forum long term goals etc i just think it's one of these um useful uh dynamics if you're a policy if i was sitting in their seat uh i'd be looking at some of these studies like mckinsey has done and what automation technology are going to do to jobs markets over the next decade looking at that and going wow this could really be a political problem at a time where we're already seeing uh social disruption across the us and western democracies more broadly uh and boy it gives me the cover to start trying out different concepts for ubi to hopefully make a transition to an economy that looks more like a nation of shopkeepers down the road where people maybe are collecting a bit of a check from the government and then also able to pursue a passion um our small shop you know through the internet etc things that you would have a much more uh robust flexible economy hopefully that's that's the happy outcome so that's it for tonight uh i had a couple questions about what i meant about that tweet today about why actually um gold at 50 000 or bitcoin at a million dollars is not a threat to the dollar it's actually the only way the u.s can win the great power competition with china full stop uh it's a lengthy discussion i'm going to touch on that this week in tree rings so uh it's one of those things i will spend a little bit more time on there in the meantime as always if

"Inflating debt/GDP lower, could the “global south” pivot first, Ghana’s gold for oil proposal",2022-12-20 17:00:30+00:00,21,bZ7ghZJ88gg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7ghZJ88gg,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hey everybody luke groman fftt hope everybody's well and had a great weekend we had a big victory in the last minute here for my beloved cleveland browns so we are actually five and two and uh so uh do i think they're for real i i think we're aiming for a wild card spot after uh the baltimore ravens and and we got to beat the steelers still so at any rate uh hope you guys had a great weekend as well i'm going to jump right in here with a few of the questions so the first question comes from uh jstt you've argued that although banks are generally not lending into the us economy they are lending to the u.s government how do you approach weighing the deflationary force of the former versus the inflationary force of the latter i thought it was a great question to me the non-lending or the the shrinking of lending into the real economy right so if you look at the fed's h.8 report what it shows is that uh loan growth is still shrinking uh last update was uh mid to high single digits on an annualized basis in aggregate total bank loan growth within the united states angus down seven to nine percent seven to nine percent i believe uh but within that uh the over the last three months the annualized rate of growth of bank treasury holdings in the united states rose at respectively 48 39 and 24 in june july and august so there's a lot there's a lot of lending going on to the us government which is what buying treasuries is uh there's not a lot of lending uh bank lending going on into the real economy uh the latter is deflationary the former is inflationary so how do i weight the two uh ultimately right now uh the the deflationary forces of of non-bank lending or the shrinking lending into the real economy are dominating however uh i think it's important to watch the ongoing fiscal response and that is why i think this stimulus conversation is so important important that we're seeing now and i think this is a stimulus conversation that's going to continue as we move into 2021 bigger picture it's an ongoing shift of the us economy that that we all grew up with towards what i've been calling in our research uh a us economy with chinese characteristics it's becoming much more centrally directed and that is what it is um this uh so to me i think it's be really important to see if there's basically the inflation versus deflation is gonna be is there enough fiscal uh action or is there not enough uh fiscal action and if the answer is enough fiscal action as we saw from march to august that's inflationary for both assets as well as commodities and if there's not enough as we've seen since september and october that's deflationary so let's watch the fiscal side is it enough is it not enough second question jp do you think the milkshake ever happens i think the milkshake already happened i think brent was exactly right when you look at both on a long time scale of history over much of this cycle uh last couple decades you've seen net international investment position uh of the united states has gone from negative eight percent and oh eight to negative sixty six zero percent uh this year uh that is basically uh foreign uh investment flowing here with a strong dollar i also think much more specifically it already happened february of 2018 through september of 2018. you saw the fed uh raising rates you saw the dollar strengthening you saw stock prices rising and i think ultimately uh what we had said was look it's less uh you really can't have all three of those uh on a sustained basis it's a trilemma you can have rates up dollar ups two of three of dollar rates up dollar up stocks up and uh sure enough later that year obviously uh fourth quarter of 18. uh the s p dropped 20 and a quarter one of the biggest single drops in the s p uh quarterly drops in history up rising rates blew up the economy and ever since then basically we've seen dollar up stocks down or stocks up dollar down and i think that's ultimately given the debt levels and where we are in the cycle likely to continue to be the case uh for the foreseeable future so uh third question charles the macro environment favors both gold miners and bitcoin bitcoin has many features uh that make it gold 2.0 yet it seems your base case is gold is slightly better than bitcoin can you discuss the reasons why uh look i like them both um in many ways gold uh i agree with a lot of what the bitcoin uh proponents say which is that gold bitcoin does a lot of the things that gold does it just does them better i think that's true in a lot of ways uh in my opinion gold is a lot like bitcoin except gold has uh less volatility and and maybe a less upside if you look at it strictly on a stock to flow basis you can make the argument that bitcoin does have more upside but also more volatility but one thing i continue to not hear uh bitcoin proponents talk about and that's something again i like bitcoin a lot i own bitcoin i've been buying more bitcoin the one thing i do not hear a lot of bitcoin proponents talk about is that gold is on central bank balance sheets and bitcoin isn't and so if there is some sort of monetary system reset where the system as it stands now remains part of what comes next uh to me you need some sort of pivot to revalue or to devalue debt uh to to to re-collateralize central bank balance sheets and gold's there and bitcoins not and that to me i think is important way i look at it is you need to own both and so uh i think weighting is a personal preference but i think you need to own both um let's uh next question the great reese from mt the great reset uh what do you think that is a big topic that's going to be hard to cover uh in the in the brief span of this to me the great reset if i had boil it down is is pretty straightforward the debt's unsustainable you you need to make changes to the system as it's structured you need a significant restructuring of the currency system you need a significant uh devaluation of the debt outstanding on a real basis um and you need political cover to get it done and for as tragic and problematic as covid has been one thing that it is providing in spades for policymakers is uh you know what did rahm emanuel say never let a crisis go to waste well they've got all the political cover they could possibly dream of uh in the form of cobit and so let's watch and see but that's what i ultimately think when you hear great reset what i when i hear great reset that is what i'm thinking about is ultimately the debts unsustainable and there need to be changes made to the system and the real value of that needs to be written down uh to avoid a much more chaotic systemic collapse uh and then the last question from jm i've been watching some of peter zion's predictions he's saying the usa will be vastly retracting his military presence worldwide does that make sense in my opinion yes it does make sense there's a great book uh entitled uh uh time to start thinking america in the age of dissent it was written by edward luce l-u-c-e i would highly recommend it the book was in 2012 and the book interviews luminaries in u.s politics technology academia finance government and basically looks at the system with a critical eye and it's it's it's basically a book says look america i love you but yes you look fat in those jeans and the reason i bring this book up is there's uh loose was invited to uh participate in an army war college strategy session that very few outsiders ever get to attend and early in the book 16 high-ranking u.s pentagon officials came to the conclusions after their study is the u.s has until 2021 to make decisions and then their hegemony is going to start to be eroded by fiscal realities they recommended a significant cut to u.s defense spending and reinvesting that defense spending into infrastructure education uh foreign aid uh retraining of of of workers uh and it's really interesting me because it is it sounds a lot like what donald trump ran and won on in 2016. so these are the senior levels of the us pentagon in 2011 saying america still has choices by 2021 america will be out of choices because of the u.s fiscal situation and so my point is is that i think what zion's talking about is does make sense i my view is it's less america doing it necessarily uh out of a a practical decision or a strategic decision regarding the military and where they want to be i think it's much more driven by fiscal realities that basically we're out too far over our skis and we can't afford all these entanglements which is exactly what high-ranking officials at the pentagon called them and talked about so i think we may be watching that play out and of course uh that needs to be talked about from a position of strength um and to be clear i think our military's still the most dominant the world i just think the military also understands that as a u.s marine corps general barrow once said amateurs study tactics professionals study logistics and the professionals at the pentagon are looking at the logistics of our supply lines relative to our fiscal situation and they're simply not sustainable anymore and so i think we're seeing that play out in real time potentially so let's watch that going forward so with that i'm going to finish up for the night as always if you like these updates please check us out fftt llc.com you can find out more information about our research product offerings there both the institutional side also on the individual side these quick updates uh dovetail pretty nicely with what we do with fftt tree rings and continue to get great feedback on that so check it out again fftt-llc.com otherwise everyone have

"Can Congress force a Fed pivot; What financial repression methods could policymakers employ, & more",2022-11-29 16:12:55+00:00,17,OSyoEjvSHjQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSyoEjvSHjQ,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fftt hope you had a great weekend it was the first beautiful weekend of the year here in cleveland 80 85 almost so very nice but being that it is cleveland it's going to be a high of 41 by wednesday so that's how that's how we roll up here so i'm gonna jump in right into the questions thank you everybody for submitting them let's uh let's look at a few of them from brendan you are reading the same fed statements regarding 50 75 75 basis point interest rate hikes yet your argument is the u.s is in no fiscal condition to pull that off it seems crazy all people are looking at the same numbers that more than one option could exist no yeah it is it does seem crazy until you to me and i'm going to be a little uh direct and a little tongue-in-cheek here uh the same types of people if not the same people outright were arguing for rate hikes in august 2019 to help get trump out of office just three weeks before repo rates spiked uh just uh three four weeks before the fed's balance sheet began growing again the fed at that point had already cut rate cut rates once and yet they were talking about raising rates for political reasons same types of people were arguing in 2002 that the label of afghanistan as the graveyard of empires wouldn't apply to the united states the same types of people were arguing that subprime is contained and so i my point is that i see the people arguing that they're going to get these rate hikes and completely ignoring the context of the us fiscal situation and i can only think of upton sinclair's famous quote which is that it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary is dependent upon his not understanding it i think that's exactly what's going on here from george humans like clean narratives on why something is happening versus accepting the randomness of decisions being made and their outcomes how do you weigh nation states making strategic decisions versus simply responding to action that in hindsight was a miscalculation i.e russia and china the way i think about it is long term it's pretty clear what various nations strategic interests are particularly vis-a-vis their sovereign debt and fiscal uh financial positions and then once we understand that you start to adjust the sales in terms of where the ship is sailing relative to those long-term strategic interests uh and i and then i try to focus on analysis um where you know i try not to focus on analysis where i have to guess if if there's a miscalculation or not you know sovereign debt is is in a position where where there can basically be no problems economically in the world anywhere ever again and so you know whether or not what has taken place is a miscalculation the math is the math and so once we get to that point then it's about risk management uh understanding the path between here and there the potential path between here and there up the range of outcomes and by that i mean deflationary episodes how do we how do we hedge that and then how does that in turn change the pace at which we are arriving what is very highly likely to be the endgame which is yield curve control uh in the us globally really as a result of sovereign debt levels uh from tumish i hold commodity stocks gold miners gold royalty uranium canadian oil producers etc i also have gold and silver should i try to lower my risk or not i guess i want what i want to know is if markets implode am i overexposed holding a lot of stock i i think it depends on your time horizon if if you're under two years under under 12 months in terms of your time horizon yeah i think there's real risk um if you have a longer term time horizon uh two to five years then then no i don't i don't think there's a lot of risk in that position based on uh the sovereign debt uh being in a position that again there can be no problems anywhere ever again uh we have a problem and from there it's about risk management um and and between here and there again deflation and then how long until the end game with yield curve control so i mean i keep coming back to no country with a fiat currency that i'm aware of has ever defaulted on its sovereign debt for lack of printing money so again i i think it's all about that risk management i think right now quite frankly we're in a period of time where you need to be aware of your risk management you i don't think you want to be too far over your skis holding commodities gold etc we've been writing a lot about that in terms of mac def max defensive position talking about raising cash for months now um to be in a better position give yourself optionality hedge volatility from karoshi why aren't we seeing spreads widening in the corporate bond market why aren't bond managers worried uh about credit risks too much uh because the risk is in sovereign debt uh it's in the sovereign debt market and therefore the risk is in duration uh i.e inflation risks and so uh in my view credit is going to follow duration inflation up rates up credit problems uh next one a big theme in your work and this from a couple people big theme in your work is that government needs to issue more debt to stay solvent and that the natural buyer is disappearing forcing the fed to purchase more of said debt what if the government instead forces native savers to purchase the debt i.e sort of like russell napier's cap day where you're forcing domestic audiences to buy at negative real rates uh the issue with that i i think number one we've already seen some elements of that with bank hqla regulations money market fund reforms they're forcing to buy treasuries for regulatory reasons the reason i think it's a problem why it won't work um is the u.s consumers is 65 of gdp consumer spending and forcing consumers and and and the private sector to buy negative real rate debt is effectively a tax hike and that hurts the consumer that hurts gdp that sends tax receipts down that sends treasury issuance up and now you need to have them by more negative real rate debt wash rinse repeat until you go into a death spiral a debt death spiral so for me because of the us's twin deficits the only way out is the fed uh buying a quorum of that debt and then the final question from invalid mike green when asked said what is a when asked what is currently a good investment for your average joe to protect net worth so there's really nothing and joe should invest his money into skills and certifications that allow him to earn more net worth is it really that bad um i depending on the time horizon uh i in the short term there's not a lot that looks really attractive right here given what policymakers given the deflationary policy mistake policymakers look likely to be embarking on led by the us beyond the very short term though i i think again secular inflation is needed to stave off sovereign defaults uh i agree either way short term or long term with the skills side between the internet uh and then also what is already beginning and is likely to get worse trade trade skills shortages i i think there's a secular trend toward basically scalping big slow moving corporations with either your brains via the internet or your trade skills on the ground i think that's going to be a big theme for coming years it's something we've talked with our boys who are uh in their teens and early 20s uh as as just that entrepreneurship really wins over the next probably decade plus so with that i'm going to sign off for today as always thank you very much for your questions uh for more information about what we are up to check out fftt-llc.com like i said more information about what we're up to as well as our more

"Updated Fed pause thoughts, Gold v. gold miners, time to buy long-dated USTs yet?",2022-11-08 19:16:24+00:00,15,h0JjJnTDa4Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0JjJnTDa4Q,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everyone luke groman fftt hope everybody had a great weekend to know here in ohio it was absolutely beautiful i just got done watching uh the la chargers and the referees defeat the cleveland browns with a couple of very poor pass interference calls that help the chargers and didn't help us so at any rate what are you going to do still very competitive and entertaining game so with that i am going to jump into this week's comments or this week's discussion first question is from sc uh question for you can you expand on your math behind the idea that the us government cannot afford to increase interest rates interest expense is a pretty small line item in the budget and they're paying almost around two percent already so i think it's important to just highlight that when i say interest expense what we're using is our true what we call true interest expense and when we say true interest expense that is not just the interest expense we don't look at net interest we look at gross interest uh but we also look at entitlement pay goes in other words the pay-as-you-go portion of entitlements and so uh that is effectively the interest expense uh on an annualized basis that you need to float the 100 trillion plus in entitlement so basically entitlement pay as you go is plus treasury spending per the quarterly treasury borrowing advisory committee report treasury spending used to be just grossed in gross interest expense now it is uh stimulus as well uh which are just entitlements effectively to keep gdp growing because it needs to keep growing so the punch line is that true interest expense entitlement pay goes plus treasury spending is 111 percent of u.s gdp a rise in interest rates would likely send u.s interest expense up uh modestly i don't think that's the real lever in the problem the real lever is that a rise in interest rates will cause tax receipts to fall pretty notably um we've seen this before and so your 111 percent uh true interest expense relative to tax receipts goes to 115 percent or 120 percent and at that point either the u.s government starts cutting spending to get those numbers back below tax receipts or else the fed steps in and prints the difference and the challenge with the us government cutting is the us government is now 30 percent of gdp the us government starts cutting that amount of gdp in a slowdown you're going to touch off a debt deflation spiral you really cannot have a recession as a policy option with that the gdp at 125 so that's i think really important a really important delineation that to understand to really treat the entitlement pay goes as interest expense from gk hi luke if we're on our way to defaulting on our debt through either inflation or deflation have you yet considered one day moving your assets out of the u.s before the government imposes capital controls and devalues or steals from its citizens as has been the case throughout history the short answer is no i will say to be clear i do not think uh the united states will nominally default on treasuries or entitlements the deflationary outcome uh i think there's zero chance of that of the us defaulting and if that's the case i think it will likely be via inflation reducing debt to gdp and what that looks like is inflation running 10 to 15 20 percent for several years in a row while the fed caps interest rates at say two percent uh bondholders get screwed to the tune of uh eight to twenty eight to fifteen percent per year for uh several years in a row uh i do not i i and now to answer the question i am not considering moving my assets out of the country uh in my opinion many countries are in a similar situation uh and the situation uh globally is quite frankly so bad that the us may be the best safest place in terms of rule of law and i think critically we have natural resources at the right price those prices are much higher in all likelihood than we're seeing today for a lot of these different resources and commodities but there are a lot of other places around the world that won't have them at any price uh in it quite possibly so uh within the us however i continue to definitely avoid bonds uh i continue to move assets uh into uh as as we have cash command i continue to deploy that cash into assets uh diversified assets by diversified by both politically acceptable inflation hedges and politically unacceptable inflation hedges um uh politically acceptable are equities in real estate politically unacceptable or golden bitcoin so um i also think that within the u.s one must start to consider certain issues one has not had to consider for a very long time uh things like uh how what is what is the carrying capacity of your state if you're living in a desert uh and we're seeing supply chains break down um i i think these are things we may start to need to think about i think if we're paying attention to what's happening in europe in china in the u.s you don't want to be in a desert with 40 million other people uh and insufficient uh in in in state food water energy resources and the reality is is that describes probably 150 million people in the u.s where they live so um i do think that's something you may need to start thinking about i think uh certain elements of politics without getting into politics certain areas um maybe better politically or tax friendly than others that's something else you need to consider but the answer is no i'm not considering moving my assets out of the u.s i think for a number of reasons um failing something getting much worse there's a lot of natural resources natural barriers the u.s has that a lot of other places don't from a non most historical inflation analysis is based on individual or a few countries facing inflation current case is more of the developed countries facing inflation along with globalism doesn't this environment favor the dollar uh i think it's the first global sovereign debt bubble bursting in the for in 100 years that's bursting and i think that's we need to uh understand that and the last time we had a global sovereign debt bubble burst was in the immediate aftermath of world war one in that instance all six global industrial powers um defaulted or devalued their currencies significantly to reduce their debt loads it felt like a default i'm sure to the sovereign bondholders u.s the u.s devalued last and i think this is an important highlight so the last time we were in a global sovereign debt bubble uk was the global reserve currency two of the six industrial powers hyper-inflated their currencies to zero the the the germans and the russians uh the french def devalued their currency two or three different times very dramatically uh the uk uh the global reserve currency devalued um uh in 1931 quite significantly i think 65 against gold and then the dollar went last in 33. uh the point is is that um i think from a rule of law perspective a natural resource perspective yes i think the us looks probably the most attractive uh from a situation where now versus then where the post 71 dollar system required us to run deficits and everyone else to effectively buy our debt to finance those deficits everyone else either doesn't want to or does not have the capital or the balance sheet to finance our deficits so this is turning into a contest of who's running the biggest deficits who and whose central bank will print the most uh the fastest and the us is going to run the biggest deficits because by virtue of the system we we we are coming to an end with the post 71 dollar system so the us has had to run the biggest deficits to supply the dollars to the world except the rest of the world's not buying our treasuries anymore so the fed's going to have to print the most to buy the most debt relative to other areas so i'm not convinced that the dollar is going to be the best currency i think ultimately it will be the worst currency um given that the fed is going to have to finance the most amount of deficits relative to anybody else with that said like i said before i think the u.s will arguably be the best place for capital but i don't think that necessarily means it's going to be good for the dollar over the course of this cycle let's see next question is from fc with reference to jason lowry's post about a captive audience uh and in quote prohibition on gold transactions in your opinion if they were to go this route perhaps also on bitcoin would this leave two of our beloved hedges against negative real rates moot uh yes it could uh i you would have to uh they would have to convince russia and china and india and actually much of eurasia to stop stockpiling gold first off uh and if they could control bitcoin which would likely require significant personal threats of either fines or jail time uh or violence um in my opinion and as such at least in the us i hope unlikely i so yes is the short answer the longer answer is is they got to get some the big creditors to play along on gold i don't think they're going to play along they've got to threaten americans with major fines or jail time i hope they're not going to do that and so i don't know that they can do a lot about gold or bitcoin with that said it does tie into my prior point about politically acceptable hedges versus politically unacceptable hedges and being diversified to me that is it's why i'm not a a bitcoin maxi if you will i it's why i can't ascribe to that or recommend that for clients is because i as long as you can ignore the political history and you think that there is zero chance that authorities won't do draconian things then i guess sure go ahead be a bitcoin maxi with that said i think you need to pay attention what's happened over the last three months we've seen the mandates uh pay attention to what's happening in australia and new zealand things are happening that we would have said 12 months ago had zero chance of happening and so there's a bigger picture potentially happening and so that's why i think it remains prudent to remain diversified within inflation hedges between politically acceptable equities real estate and politically unacceptable quote unquote uh gold bitcoin uh from wb luke do you have a strong or even a medium conviction on the direction of the general u.s stock market over the next two to three months i do not lots of counterbalances both ways in my opinion next two to three months let me back up any sort of short term time horizon i often don't have a strong feeling one way or another one of those right now one of those times is probably not right now and the reason i i feel that way i don't have a strong conviction either way is because it's so political in other words right now it's all about the us government are we gonna are we gonna raise a debt ceiling are we gonna have a political infighting are we gonna shut down i i have i have no edge on that and and so i'm just not comfortable one way or another with that said the thing i do have extremely high conviction is when we look out beyond uh two to three months four months five months six months and beyond it is absolutely a matter of u.s national security for the stock market to rise the policy makers in the u.s have allowed the system to evolve in a way that stocks have to rise to support consumer spending to support gdp and tax receipts and given our debt position given how big stocks are there's simply not the ability for a policy to allow stocks to fall 20 and stay down 20 could stocks fall 20 absolutely we saw it last march will stocks be allowed to stay down 20 percent in my view absolutely not and we saw that last march as well and then last question of the night from cc igor session of rosneft excuse me blames energy shortages on years of under investment partly driven by net zero's targets he also predicts think things will get worse does this contradict the peak cheap oil theory could climate action missteps crash the world economy in my opinion it does not uh contradict peak cheap oil i think net zero particularly in the west may actually be code for peak cheap oil uh because if you say climate change and net zero you sound like a hero if you come out and say hey peak cheap oil or peak oil uh the bond market crashes on you and people freak out and act very differently in terms of behavior so it's um to me it seems like it could very well be a much more politically acceptable way of getting to the same thing let's set that aside and say that's crazy conspiracy theory talk and say that's absolutely not true climate change is climate change even then i don't think it discredits peak cheap oil in any way or contradicts it in any way because ultimately you can still see where the marginal sources of supply are likely to have to come from and almost unanimously they require higher or significantly higher prices for oil and gas to drive that investment so i think whether it is i i think ultimately net zero is making things worse but i don't think it's the reason i think we're the real issue is the level of growth and what's happening with geology now could climate action missteps crash the world economy yeah i do uh take a look at what's happening in europe take a look at what's happening in the uk take a look at what's happening in china um it's all fun and games until there's not gas at the pumps uh it's all fun and games until you've got to shut down your factory because there's no electricity because there's no gas so there's no coal so uh i admire the peak cheap or excuse me the net zero and the climate change of what they're trying to do with that said um look i've got solar panels on my roof um but when i put the solar panels on i didn't connect i didn't disconnect my natural gas generator i didn't disconnect my natural gas secondary heat i didn't disconnect wood-burning stoves i have i didn't disconnect geothermal hvac units that i have i i'm hedged but i didn't disconnect those and i can speak from someone with solar panels in cleveland ohio it'd be really really cold uh for a lot of the winter if i was relying on those bad boys for my heat all winter uh so i think it's been very sub-optimal planning i'll be i'll try to be politically correct here i think it's been very sub-optimal planning certainly can that crash the world economy absolutely uh because a cold winter for me if i just have solar panels is an economy crashing if that's applied more broadly to an economy so let's see what happens ultimately i continue to be very bullish on fossil fuels broadly and so with that that's it for the night as always thank you for joining me uh as always if you're interested in

"Weaponization of the USD, Fed tools to inflate away the debt, US government price floor on oil",2022-10-25 14:58:56+00:00,10,5O6u2MJzIMY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O6u2MJzIMY,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fftt hope everybody had a great weekend i'm going to jump right in to the discussion i appreciate everybody's questions first off from qr what is the most important piece or pieces of data you are waiting to see to determine if your thesis is correct a lot of smart people out there think we will have a fairly standard deflationary recession i can't buy that but it could be correct uh great question uh first i would say there's some some some things i'm looking for in terms of dogs that are barking and then i'm also going to be looking for for for the proverbial dogs that don't bark so what i mean by that is dogs that are barking federal and state tax receipts i think are going to be a big one you started to see a collapse in june in new york uh california you saw u.s tax receipts down big on a single month in may they're going to get worse just if nothing else given the comps so that's one area dogs that don't bark or aren't barking and should be uh energy price is falling they're not they should be uh yields they should be collapsing not just coming off the highs but collapsing uh they're they're really not so those are the types of things i'm watching for no one thing in aggregate but it's more a mosaic putting it together and trying to see things that are happening that should be and then things that should be that aren't from cm luke do you think the u.s can find demand outside of the fed for treasuries to allow us to keep running big deficits i think that's where you and snyder have a different view why would powell pivot if demand for treasuries remains high and the government can pay its bills that i think where jeff and i vary is how long the u.s can run this playbook the u.s can chase money out of equities effectively into treasuries to support the treasury market they've done so in the first half of this year but they can only do it for a little bit uh because the challenge is that the u.s government also needs money in equities going into equities um to or needs rising equities excuse me to fund consumer spending which is two-thirds plus of gdp and that then funds tax receipts so if equities are going into treasuries that gives you a temporary bid for the treasury mark but that means money is not going into equity so equities are falling if equities are falling forget about falling alan greenspan 2015 said if equities just don't rise let alone fall this will happen so it's really like a shark that needs to keep swimming to not die uh if if money is flowing into treasuries instead of equities or out of equities into treasuries then you're going to get consumer spending down you're going to get gdp down you're going to get tax receipts down when tax receipts go down you're going to have an increase in treasury issuance because most of what the government spends can't be cut entitlements treasuries defense treasury spending defense and so your deficits are going to rise so the amount of treasuries or the amount of money you need going into equities goes up so now you need more money out of equities in the treasuries to support the equity market equities down more consumers spending down more gdp down more tax receipts down more treasury issuance up more now you need more money out equities into treasuries this is not a guess we've seen this empirically happen twice in the last three years this was effectively what happened at the repo rate spike alongside some regulatory issues the fed jumped very quickly started doing not qe to support that and then of course we saw the sell-off in the treasury market really a crash in the treasury market alongside a crash in stocks in 2020 again you had a period of time there was a flow into treasuries but then because of the importance of equity prices to u.s gdp u.s consumer spending and u.s tax receipts they can only run that playbook for so long and i think that's a big difference where i think you know it sounds like jeff thinks that they can and others just not the only one hey let's just run the equity market into the treasury market you can do that for a few months you can't do that add into an item because the equity market is the economy uh on the margin uh jt how can you be so confident that the us can only tighten so much because it needs to service its debt where is the line why is it not mattered prior to that does reserve currency status factor in our congress or a congressional ability to raise the debt ceiling so the per rogoff and reinhardt uh rogoff's former chief economist of the imf reinhardt one of the foremost experts in the world on sovereign debt and sovereign debt crises via hirschmann capital uh over the past 120 years 98 of countries that got debt the gdp over 130 percent defaulted typically via high or runaway inflation uh over the past 30 years per the same group of people 100 percent of countries that had debt the gdp over 110 and deficits of over 11 percent of gdp defaulted on their sovereign debt within two years typically via again high inflation to inflate away the debt the u.s hit 130 in 2020 and it hit that magic level of um of of 110 and 11 debt and deficits in 2021 and so basically overwhelming consensus is it's different this time for the us i don't think it's different this time 120 years uh 98 shots in this business 100 shots in this business they don't come around much it's just a matter of managing your chips now does reserve currency status matter absolutely uh it means matters in two ways number one it means that if the us decides to go into austerity which we have just gone through a four to five month period of doing um where treasury spending was down 30 year-over-year in the last three months on a trailing three-month basis then what you're going to get is a dollar super spike and you're going to get the us squeezing the world into austerity that's what you're getting you're getting brent's milkshake or the modified version of brent's milkshake where dollar up everything else down however that is ultimately um that that's ultimately uh requires a belief that the us will stand aside as every asset in the world basically goes to zero including stocks treasury bonds u.s housing market all they're not going to policy makers are not gonna stand aside um and and burn down the system they created in my view if you believe that then there's no limit to the dollar all that i think ultimately policymakers are self-interested uh and legacy interested and they are not gonna stand aside and let the system they created burned down which is what will happen if we do what we've done over the last three four months for another as little as three to four months and certainly probably not more than 12 months with that said it also means that the u.s though the reserve currency status also means the u.s has the leeway to print the money to fund its own deficits which i think what they'll do and when they do it in my view when that will be extremely inflationary not just for the us but for the world and that suggests owning assets gold bitcoin stocks etc more finite assets so those like i said 98 to 100 shots don't come around very often in this business it's almost never different this time um and so it suggests it's much more about uh playing your chips and and managing your chips well um then getting the direction right so from gb which economy will collapse first the chinese with its banking and real estate imminent uh crisis or the u.s mega everything bubble economy uh i think it's a trick question uh they're both tied at the hip uh very closely and very tightly and so if one goes the other will go probably by that afternoon maybe by the next day or the next week but uh one goes the other goes and that's a good way to think about that in my view is look lehman brothers was 800 billion dollar balance sheet it defaulted and within what a week it began putting the global financial system at risk by way of comparison china as of a couple years ago had a 37 trillion dollar balance sheet and is responsible for a significant portion of the supplies on the shelves that you see in u.s stores so orders of magnitude bigger means orders of magnitude worse crisis orders of magnitude faster so from sean did the fed pivot last week my fed dakota ring isn't working in my opinion maybe i think a better way to think about it is that the fed teed up the pivot for later this month at jackson hole reportedly powell is speaking there in four weeks i one thing i feel very strongly about is the data over the next 30 days are going to get meaningfully worse uh in ver i i have pretty strong uh pretty strong conviction in that so i think going into jackson hole you're going to have a a a a a softer or more dovish powell from last week 30 days of bad data worsening data and then him speaking so i think it's gonna be a really interesting month from rd we'd love to hear your thoughts on us real estate over the next couple decades i'm trying to grapple with the many variables at play demographics financial repression remote work internal migration etc i agree there's lots of variables uh the work from home dynamic amazon and what they're doing to light retail space demographics uh financial oppression i think i think for for for real estate as far as how i'm thinking about it personally there's i think two big factors two of the biggest factors i think number one real rates have to be significantly negative over the next five to ten years uh because of the us fiscal position so that's thing number one you're going to get these periods of time like we've had over the last three to six months where the u.s government and u.s policy makers are going to pretend like they can actually tighten and send real rates positive and they might even do so for a cup of coffee but you're going to get what we're seeing now which is the economy is coming unhinged very fast and they're going to have to back off so over the next five to 10 years real rates likely need to be quite negative so that's really good for real estate uh all else equal and then i think uh the other big thing is is as always it's it's location right so i think real estate that isn't unique in some way lakefront oceanfront tied to commodities so maybe farmland or hobby farm when you're thinking about a personal investment there's a lot of other factors to consider baby boomers own a lot of real estate their kids don't when the baby boomers die how does that real estate transfer are there sales is it is it you know there's a lot but so i think sort of these two big factors real rates very likely have to be significantly negative and then looking for unique aspects uh making it making it finite i think are are ways i've i've thought about it personally from mb uh much talk of u.s versus japan we've now seen the bank of japan do explicit yield curve control and price action in yen crosses nikkei jgb etc if when fed goes to yield curve control how will major u.s indices react in similar and different ways i think it's a when the u.s goes to yield curve control and i think it'll be much more uh the outcomes will be much more argentinian unfortunately effectively um because again china runs or excuse me japan runs a current account surplus or did until their energy bill went to the moon over the last several months u.s runs a current account deficit japan has a net international investment position called positive 65 percent of gdp in plain english japan can sell its dollar assets down to zero to finance its deficits when it goes into deficit situation or its fiscal deficits if it wants to the u.s has no such option its net international investment position is negative 75 of gdp there is no savings account for the us the savings account is the fed printing press and they will use it as we have seen um so i think it gets me much more inflationary much faster in the u.s if when the u.s goes to yield curve control and then it's going to feed on itself because again the japan finances its fiscal deficits internally the u.s still finances a significant portion of them internationally so you will see the bond market uh globally put itself to the fed much faster than the bond market uh there's the jgb market has put itself to the bank of japan because as long as there have been uh it's internally funded and there's deflation there's still okay real rates for japanese savers that's not what's going on here in the us with this situation uh and then finally from ag please please cover your take on gold for the remainder of the year and into 2023. uh yeah miners have been disappointing you today they had a great first quarter um and then it's been all bad news in the second and under the early third quarter uh gold slightly disappointing but but not really gold has outperformed pretty much everything but the dollar uh and oil year to date um and especially given what has happened to nominal rates and real rates i think gold's actually done pretty well and i still really like gold for three reasons number one western governments will not will will they will default on their sovereign debt with sustained real rates positive real rates they need significant sustained significant negative real rates that's a great environment for gold that has not changed at all if anything it's gotten more favorable in terms of the outlook for gold number two gold tends to trade with oil over time and peak cheap oil peak cheap energy is playing out before our eyes um and so that's positive for a gold and then number three again another thing that i think is accelerating before our eyes multi-currency settlement of energy uh it's it's progressing and it is likely to be accelerated by this year's events you've seen comments from zoltan pozar talking about this you've seen comments from pippa malngren talking about this and what i mean specifically the eu and japan are going to have energy crises soon and one way out of that is to buy energy in their own currency and settle in gold not saying that's what's going to happen up but it could uh and ultimately things are going to come to a head because of these energy crises and ultimately using gold in any capacity to even partially settle energy surpluses or deficits excuse me as i think we are moving toward as evidence suggests we're moving toward uh requires a much higher gold price much higher physical gold price so with that i'm going to finish up for today as always thank you for joining me if you're interested in more uh more updates like

"Fed pause/pivot update, UK bond market thoughts, Potential differences now v. 2018, 2019 Fed moves",2022-10-11 14:29:42+00:00,15,PP2vfeHLAoE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP2vfeHLAoE,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everyone luke groman fft hope everybody had a great weekend beautiful weekend here uh perfect weather uh nice and sunny so hope it was nice for you as well let's jump right in uh start with first question from ns hey luke what are your triggering one of your tree ring subscribers thank you very much in relation to the weimar chart with wild swings and the old german reichsmark versus gold do you think wild swings are going to happen with everything in the next few years even with sectors you recommend in weekly tree rings reports it would help with emotional control thank you um i get i get it trust me with everything going on it is uh it's it's at times uh it is it's pretty crazy out there so uh the short answer is yes i think we have been seeing and i think we will probably see um everything continue to swing i think really what we've been seeing uh since 4q18 right remember we had stocks fall 20 percent peak to trough and 4q18 it was the biggest drop in uh decades and then the fed turned around and boom we have uh a rebound and then we have uh volatility and short-term rates and 3q19 repo rate spike boom spikes to eight to ten percent fed comes in switches the balance sheet or goes from shrinking the balance sheet to growing it again and not qe to bring those repo rates down boom you have a melt up in stocks um coven melt down and then fed comes in with huge qe melt up um we've seen a meltdown in uh melt up and then melt down in crypto uh in bitcoin uh uh which as you guys know is really what we focus on uh uh in the in the crypto world so uh i think we're seeing it i think we're seeing it shorter in shorter intervals uh and that's why i think the key takeaway from that chart is is and something i've been repeating is we are going through the first bursting global sovereign debt bubble in a hundred years in my opinion we are going through the first change in the global currency system in over 50 years uh it's not a time to be levered uh it is a for the average individual for the average investor is a time to be conservative with the leverage because it's the leverage that kills you in these in these swings have a pretty high degree of of confidence how this cycle is going to end we don't know how we go from here to there at any given point in time but it's highly likely to be volatile as you see in that chart and that's what i really think is the key message is where do we want to be as we have a longer term view of it and then just understanding where we are within those short swings i think within that things like gold will swing less i think things like um uh bitcoin will swing more i think commodities um energy is a little bit of us of a special situation here and we'll touch on this later but there's the supply situation is getting worse and worse and as a result it actually normally would be a much more volatile commodity in in this situation but it hasn't been and there may be informational value than that stocks have been volatile bonds have been volatile so you're seeing these swings and so i think they are likely to continue they are likely to continue at ever shorter intervals now from jerry hi luke would love to get your take on a gold versus bitcoin comparison not regarding their respective characteristics or properties nor which you may prefer but rather which in current economic conditions you feel the market will favor and why you feel that way in my opinion the market's gonna favor bitcoin in rising liquidity environments like we saw from call it april 2020 through june of 2021 uh and and gold it will favor gold and ill liquidity uh receding liquidity environments uh like we've seen june 21 through today i also think gold's value has more uh implicit reset value uh since it's on central bank balance sheets and what i mean by that is on current course and track really the way this ends is basically a massive write-up of gold um uh it mechanically creates uh dollars devalues uh the debt uh with the way it's works with the us with with the gold on u.s a balance sheet uh vis-a-vis fed operating manual um and so i think ultimately as some sort of reset value of gold is much higher than where it trades today there's some time between here and there but because gold is on central bank balance sheet i think it has some reset value but that is just more for informational to answer your question directly um i think once we get this turn in liquidity um which i think will be in response to the economy getting much weaker than people realize that i think it's happening as we speak i think in the short run it favors uh bitcoin over gold uh with the key caveat that if uh central banks decide to keep raising rates into that it's gonna favor gold not bitcoin so uh i i i think more liquidity is coming sooner than people think though so uh from lindsay and from pm kind of uh two two questions that are uh in the same vein how high do you think the fed can take the fed funds rate before something breaks how long do you think powell will go hiking go on hiking without a pause or what the the his target fed funds rate is over the next six to 12 months um i personally think he's planning to hike monthly until something systemic breaks regardless of the stock market pain but could see him pausing prior to midterms i think something has broken and people don't realize it yet i'm hearing the us economy has not slowed i'm hearing it is slammed on the brakes like bounce your face off the steering wheel slammed on the brakes and so i think it's going to start to become more obvious in the next uh six to eight weeks and when it does if it does when it does uh then i think we've reached a critical moment which is what does the fed do do they let people twist in the wind do they let the economy crash they let stocks crash do they let everything crash right ahead of uh of a midterm i i don't think they do and so i think we have already broken well we need to break we look they've broken crypto they've broken froth the housing market's rolling you're seeing inventories of houses at nine months new home sales every other time in 50 years that new home inventories have hit nine months of sales we've either been almost on the brink of a recession or already in a recession so i think what needed to break has begun to break um they got to be very careful they break too much the amount of qe they are going to need to do to keep the system from collapsing will break their credibility uh from warren uh your thoughts on the highest yield that could be reached in this hiking cycle using the 10-year bond uh i think this ties into the point uh that i just uh talked about before uh technical people i really respect in terms of their their view on what 10-year yield is where it could go before it starts to get really um non-linear or chaotic i i've heard you hit 3.4 percent on the 10-year you could see the 10-year go to 4.7 really really fast uh driven by hedging selling um etc it just feeds on itself banks mortgage uh uh players they all have to hedge exposures that's selling treasury bonds that's driving so you could go three point four percent three point five percent four point seven percent really really quickly if you get that kind of a non-linear move higher in the 10-year yield that has enormous implications and number one i think it's bad for everything but the dollar basically i think you would see basically everything but the dollar go down in that case i don't think it would last for very long though because ultimately now you're getting into systemic collapse risks you're going to be talking about the housing market screeching to a halt you'll be talking about impairing the value of real estate across bank balance sheets you're going to be sending stocks down sharply and at that point i think you see the fed back off really fast and again it's going to be a horrible look for the fed if that's how the way it goes down is now they've got to come in instead of just backing off on the rates they lose a lot of credibility they knock markets down and then they come right back in to save markets because at the end of the day with with equity market cap still where it is the stock market effectively is the economy via the consumption link via the tax receipt link uh in terms of marginal consumption so gun to my head i think that's how it goes down i think ultimately uh the supply demand decide on on treasuries um i think you see tax receipts come in pretty light in the next couple of of uh months slash quarters and as that happens you end up with um more more supply of treasuries less demand for treasuries i think if you do break above the 10-year above the 3.4 percent things start to get really um could get really non-linear and then things will move really fast and i think really fast as down fast back up to new highs just as fast because the fed's gonna have to react in my view uh from kurt what do you expect to be the fastest horse when the fastest horses when the fed knife finally touches bone and is withdrawn uh energy commodities in bitcoin uh ultimately um are i think the fastest horses and certainly the fastest horses that i that i myself put my money to work in uh which is maybe some of the um lesser quality cryptos would go higher faster i i just i'm not wired that way i would rather own what i understand on and and on the proof of work side which i think has a much better longer term uh outlook use etc from tt can you comment regarding oil windfall profit taxes in the eu and maybe the u.s what will this do to the price of oil and everything else i think it's self-defeating i think it's to be blunt stupid uh short-sighted uh a-historical um all you're gonna do is reduce capital flows and energy at a time you need capital flows into energy rising uh you're gonna send prices higher uh prices higher into a downturn it's going to make the stagflationary impulses worse and this is something everybody learned 50 years ago but of course uh all these policymakers now in their 60s and uh 50s and 60s either don't remember it or were very young for it or think they're smarter than their grandparents were or know better and they're just making the same mistakes basically reacting to a political outcry rather than addressing the real situation or as i've coined the phrase managing the optics not managing to outcomes which is how we got in this problem in the first place so bad idea higher oil prices higher gas prices uh more inflation uh in everything else and so i think it's it would be what we're seeing today on steroids uh and then the final one for tonight uh from andreas will we have a pullback in commodities through the summer on positive inflation going down and war ending narrative or commodity and energy markets have been destroyed too much for this to happen uh i i think you need truly massive demand destruction in the economy just uh to get oil and gas down at this point um and quite frankly i tweeted about this last week where the supply demand side on energy is so strained in my view that uh the amount of demand destruction that you would need or it's going to put sovereign bond markets global bond markets at risk of default uh to get oil down and so i i think the demand destruction um it would just have to be an enormous number when you start putting the default risk on the table for sovereigns would you rather own energy or would you rather own a sovereign bond with default risk i'd rather own the energy right so you got to be very careful if you're a policy maker in what you wish for in terms of geopolitical i think i do think if you got some sort of peace um or ceasefire in in ukraine or if you had putin replaced by a western proxy like a a modern day boris yeltsin who [music] can can basically get the russian energy industry into under control of more western hands uh then then then maybe that would be seen i don't know it would do a lot actually for supplies at that point but i do think it would take some of the risk premium out of oil uh to the extent it exists so uh i i think you'd really need basically the system to collapse or uh and you know we saw that until march 2020 and the supply demand situation wasn't even as stressed as it is today in my view which is um you got oil down by basically shutting down the world um if you shut down the world again one way or another i think you get oil down um but i think it's really noteworthy china basically did shut down and oil didn't move i think that might be the most important development of the second quarter that very few people are talking about still as best i can tell is china was really shut down to a pretty good extent and oil didn't fall so ultimately i think it'd be really hard to get the demand destruction and needed to drive oil down if you don't get oil down you're not going to get ags down i think you've gotten some of the metals down but ultimately um i think the energy ag complex looks really good from a fundamental standpoint so with that i am going to pau and for today thank you as always for joining me uh if you want more information about what we're up to or learn more about our

Fed pivot timing update; GBP thoughts; What “breaks” this time?,2022-09-27 15:03:16+00:00,12,8bIlCXPlXAw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIlCXPlXAw,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope everybody had a great weekend some beautiful uh weather uh this weekend here in ohio a little bit of a storm this morning got some baseball in at any rate so that's that's good a couple i had been able to watch some baseball have a catch with my youngest son so it was uh it was a great weekend with all three of the boys and and mrs fft so with that in mind uh out of the way we're gonna we're gonna jump right into uh some of the the questions and some of the thoughts and and talk and shop here so the first one is from solar he said that jeff snyder said that if bonds ignored second huge cpi in a row it's because real inflation is a global factor and if global underlying factors right now are very different than u s cpi numbers look at yields all over the world they are telling you it ain't inflation what are your thoughts on jeff's comments i'm not sure the bond markets and in particular government bond markets around the world are telling us anything because they're not markets a market is a a risk a buyer who has risk meeting a seller who has risk in their decisions who are risking capital in their decisions and agreeing upon a price and what is happening in government bond markets around the world is sellers are selling most central banks are buying significant majorities of sovereign issuance and central banks don't have a risk of loss of capital they have printing presses so by definition what we're seeing in sovereign bond markets i don't know that there is a tremendous amount of informational value vis-a-vis inflation or deflation um you know maybe on the margin a little bit but look if if if we were seeing deflation uh stocks wouldn't be doing what they're doing home prices wouldn't be doing what they're doing food prices wouldn't be doing what they're doing um so use car prices wouldn't be doing what they're doing so i i i think you know when i look around the world and say okay you know cars food land real estate houses stocks all going up and government bonds saying hey deflation um you know i'm just not i i think the issue is is i think the odd man out is that they're not markets uh they are political utilities with the price being set uh for political reasons for political expediency by central bank so those are the thoughts there uh from charles if the fft case for selling some bitcoin is rooted in the anti-bitcoin rhetoric from some corners of the u.s government does the pro-bitcoin legislation coming from some states and foreign nations mollify those concerns to an extent it's a great question uh i think just to clarify the case for selling some of my bitcoin to basically pay off to basically get debt free was rooted not just in the anti-bitcoin rhetoric from certain corners of the government which has been around for a long time uh in some form and quite frankly i didn't really pay much attention to but it was really what caught my attention was the anti-bitcoin rhetoric taking a much more um dark turn for you know for lack of a better word maybe a neocon turn in the last month month and a half almost uh following some iraq war ii rhetoric where uh there just seemed to be this this decision somewhere that was made and regardless of the facts regardless of how it would hurt america there was a conclusion that wanted to be reached and it was going to be pushed forward and it seems like once again facts don't matter there's simply a narrative being pushed with a specific end in mind and so i wanted to hedge my risk to that having lived through the iraq war ii or you sat there going okay 9 11 is terrible tragedy we think we know who did it and now we're going to go bomb iraq and you kind of go wait what why are we gonna do that and at first it was well there's no way we'll do that and now we're okay we're doing that well we won't be there long and then 20 years later here we are so i just understanding having lived through that and again there's not a specific concrete quantitative thing to point to here um you know some of what i do is is just basically use experience and intuition and there just to me was this uh tone change in the last month month and a half in the wrong long run i don't think it's gonna matter for bitcoin to be clear uh i think uh i i don't think it will but i think in the short run it introduces volatility and i just wanted to head some of my own risk to that and i wanted to be transparent uh for my clients to that and that's why i share that uh out there and again still own a substantial amount of bitcoin so uh just wanted to clarify on that um and and so it's a great question uh from jp is the milkshake done or not um look as originally defined the milkshake was dollar up stocks up rates up and if we define it like that and it was basically rates up capital flowing here stocks up dollar up a virtuous cycle that virtuous cycle milkshake yeah i think that's done uh us debt is too high u.s stocks are too big a percentage of consumer spending and as a result too big a percentage of gdp and u.s tax receipts uh u.s net international investment position or nip is too negative at negative 65 percent of gdp and so all of those three factors means that now if the dollar rises too much or rates rise too much stocks are highly likely to fall uh and so if if we define the milkshake as i understood it to be originally defined then yeah i think that's done by virtue of where the nip is where debt is uh and how important stocks have been allowed to become via policy as a as a driver of the economy now if the milkshake is simply the dollar going up as it's uh you know it seems like some people that are quoting brent saying hey it's just the dollar up is the milkshake well no that can the dollar go up absolutely the dollar could go up the dollar could go up a lot look if the fed came out tomorrow and said we're going to sell all 8 trillion out of our bond portfolio by july 4th i guarantee i got to be careful guarantees are very it is highly highly likely that the dollar would scream higher um stocks would likely crash very rapidly around the world and treasury yields would actually probably rise uh potentially significantly corporate bond yields would rise potentially significantly so can the dollar rise 100 percent of the dollar can rise can we have the dollar rise stocks rise and yield rates rise uh all at the same time that i think is is i think that ship has sailed from db what is the impact of the basel iii net stable funding ratio requirements on gold and silver in terms of price movement and future volatility another great question you know i i i know we're only two weeks out three weeks out from it going live in europe and in the us january 1st for the uk still at this point as far as i know uh it's too early to tell uh even with that but all else equal it seems to be forcing these rules seem to be forcing and unwind of the unallocated gold market in london and if that is the case i think uh you will see an increase in gold and silver volatility all else equal and i think over time you will see higher prices for both and then the final question from az you state that inflation will be more persistent than consensus expects hence bond yields will rise uh which will force the deficit to rise to unsustainable levels this inevitable dynamic will force the fed to implement yield curve control what if the fed and primary dealers find another way out and uh this also will also tie in another question from vt about the us government's desire for negative real rates um and and these both tie in so i i think there is there's always another way out um the the us government could slash spending on one of its two big big non-interest expense items which are entitlements or defense um they're nearly 100 of tax receipts just on their own those two line items uh the problem is that if you slash them i think slashing them is is in my opinion politically impossible uh and and it's really economically impossible as well because if you slash entitlements americans are going to have to save a lot more money because they've been counting on those entitlements so they didn't save as much in the past so if they start saving going forward now not only are they going to have less money in their pocket today from the entitlements but they're also going to need to start saving more of every incoming dollar and so consumer spending would fall potentially quite precipitously when you look at the percentage of u.s uh personal consumption expenditures that's being driven by government transfer payments which is last i checked over 30 percent big number you would be in this situation where uh americans saving more money they're not getting as much money u.s consumer spending falls consumer spending is 65 percent of gdp gdp falls once you have gdp fall with debt the gdp at 130 percent as it is in america uh and high elsewhere around the world as well but uh 130 that the gdp in america is if you have gdp fall it's a recipe for a u.s debt crisis what does that look like that looks like stocks down yields up which is exactly what we saw after 12 days of a sharp sell-off in march 2020 we saw yields up in october 2020 after about a six percent sell-off in the nasdaq we saw yields up about a month ago with a modest sell-off in stocks here in the u.s so uh that's i think ultimately the the challenge of running another playbook or running a a different attack there there are there's always other choices uh the challenge is based on the decisions we have made over an extended period of time from a policy maker standpoint from a voter standpoint uh in in america in particular the choices we have left are are bad and worse there's no longer really appear to be any good choices it's bad choices and really bad choices so that's unfortunately the lay of the land so with that i'm going to wrap it up for tonight i want to thank everybody again for joining us here on a sunday night catch-up always enjoy doing these as always if you are interested in finding out more about what we're up to check out fftt-llc.com you can

Indicators we watch; EU/UK energy crisis thoughts; Capital flows to US equities possible in 2H22?,2022-09-07 14:00:26+00:00,16,qeJJV1ChWa0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeJJV1ChWa0,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fftt hope everybody had a great weekend uh first day of spring uh coming so it's nice that it's finally here hopefully that'll be the end of the snow for us so uh with that i'm gonna jump right in uh first question is from todd seems like the base question is what instrument asset slash foreign currency will surplus nations hold their trade surpluses in the yuan is not convertible crypto is very very volatile i think the system that is evolving rapidly now or more rapidly now but it's been evolving for much of the last decade since the great financial crisis is i think you're going to increasingly see nations trade with each other in their local currencies i think they will net out uh imports and exports of goods and services and then if there's any net left over uh some will probably be held in local government bonds of the of the deficit running nation but i think some of it will be held in gold as well that floats in all currencies uh and gold will be the neutral reserve asset i think it's interesting in this in this conversation that even though yuan's not convertible uh chinese government bonds have outperformed treasuries on a two year a three year and a ten year basis which i learned in the last several weeks and really surprised me when i learned it but gold is also outperformed treasuries on a two-year three-year and then a nine-year basis basically if you strip out the one-quarter sell-off in gold in 2q13 gold has significantly outperformed treasuries over the last 10 years as well uh which is i think is interesting to do because a big part of the recent gold fell sharply in 2q13 as there was an unprecedented run on physical gold uh in the london and u.s markets so i think the system is already moving in this direction we can see central banks reserving way more gold than uh treasuries over the last eight years um and i think it's only going to accelerate after the weaponization of central bank fx reserves that we saw three weeks ago uh when the u.s and europe froze russians fx reserves from charles do you think it would be better to hold more gold than silver in the months and years ahead how do you see the price of silver reacting to the scenario you laid out on grant williams podcast last week uh i've always held more gold than silver uh i actually actually sold most of my silver uh back in april of 2011 with uh above 40 bucks which was one of one of the best sales in my careers actually uh uh better lucky than good sometimes but to answer your question in my opinion yes i i do think it would be better to hold more gold than silver and the the reasoning here is is pretty intuitive but i think once once you're here to be straight forward number one gold is on central bank balance sheets silver's not um and you can revalue gold higher gold can be allowed to move much higher to be big enough to be used as a neutral settlement asset because for the very reason that it's not used for anything silver has the drawback actually of being used for something in this case so i'll use a much more extreme example just to make my point let's say instead of gold that central banks uh decided to create a weak dollar right or a wheat as your neutral reserve asset right so we're gonna we're gonna bid up the price of wheat uh to basically re-collateralize the system offset the debt on a net basis be big enough to settle global trade in wheat okay uh the price of wheat that uh we would have to see for wheat to be big enough to serve as a global neutral reserve asset would be so high that billions of people across the emerging markets would starve to death and so you can see very quickly with this extreme example why using an a a a neutral asset a commodity that is used for something is a really bad idea uh for uh for for for a reserve asset so silver um half of its monetary roughly half of its productive use it's an industrial good if you used silver uh and if you bid the price of silver up as much as you needed to uh be big enough to settle global trade in silver you would be pricing a lot of silver applications industrial applications right out of the market you'd be making um solar panels too expensive you'd be making all the different applications way too expensive and so that's kind of counterproductive to what a lot of policies we're trying to move toward and so now do i think silver will move higher in the scenario that grant and i talked about yes absolutely i think it is going to participate in uh with with inflation and probably at a premium given its its criticality in a number of different important industrial and green energy applications however i think there's been over the last 10 20 years this growth in the gold the silver ratio it moves around but ultimately i think on a secular basis the gold to silver ratio will probably keep moving higher uh because like i said secularly i don't know about in the short run but secularly um because gold's not used for anything it the fact that you know if you bid if gold is made big enough to be the neutral reserve asset unlike wheat unlike silver nobody's going to starve no industrial applications are really going to get shut down because gold isn't used for anything so i think that's why for me in the current scenario and the scenario that grant i talked about i i think it for me i would rather hold gold than silver i think you want to own both but i hold more gold and silver for that reason uh from mike in a recent interview and many in the past you discussed the opportunity for the u.s to revalue gold when you explained it recently it seemed like all roses aren't there losers for every winner in a restructuring who would be the losers those holding dollars uh in a short in in a word yes uh more specifically those holding dollar denominated debt uh because inflation would likely surge in the in the revaluing gold delevering the system juicing economic growth uh scenario that i've laid out most bondholders though i think are still in denial that sovereign debt is so high globally as a result of kicking the problems upstairs for 25 years that their choice now is not make money in bonds or not make money in bonds their choice is now lose money in bonds via inflation or lose money in bonds via restructuring or defaults that's that's it uh that's where we are in the long debt cycle and you get the sovereign debt bubbles that's how these things work out and so it's just we haven't had a global sovereign debt bubble in 100 years they're in my opinion very likely to lose money on a real basis uh but look bondholders had a 40-year bull market it was a good run um but i think it's for me i think that bull runs over and i think ultimately when we look back in history the the death of the 40-year bull market will be officially dated probably right after covet but it might uh they might put the uh the official date three weeks ago february 26 2022 when the u.s and eu weaponized russian central bank fx reserves basically said these fx reserves and extremists are not money good uh let's see from frank housing is nuts rates up prices way up bidding wars all contingencies waived no supply is this a blow off top or is this the beginning of what happens during an inflationary cycle to me i think there's something i think it's a part of an inflationary cycle but i think there's something pretty unique to um us history in particular which is there are an estimated 35 trillion dollars in assets uh in wealth that the baby boomers hold collectively um they've spent the last two years being told by everybody in the media that they're gonna die way sooner than they expected from cove and so now we're sort of unfolding from that un unwinding from that and the boomers are long a bunch of money in their short time in their minds and and de facto right you you when you're older you're short time so i i think when you do that you factor in that calculus uh they say look so what if the home price is up 20 buy it so what if it's up 40 buy it so what if it's up 50 you know what i've got this money my kids i want to help them buy it um when you add in required minimum distributions uh when you add in wall street investors that have been bidding prices all cash increasingly aggressively over the last 18 to 24 months i think housing is likely to be nuts for quite some time and probably to a certain extent not nearly as sensitive to rates as a lot of people think they might be because i think what we're really seeing when i say they have 35 trillion in assets they're long money in their short time 35 trillion in assets really represents the sterilization of inflation of deficits that should have happened over the last 40 years um but instead policymakers incented the baby boom generation to defer compensation basically take some of those those dollars out of the system sterilize the inflation had they spent that money in the economy you would have had cpi inflation at the time instead it was sterilized in asset price inflation asset prices rose but now by virtue of their life cycle it's coming back out of the sterilized asset inflation into the real economy and i think housing is just a symptom of that i think we're gonna see more of it uh because there's really no interest rate that you can send rates to uh that the boomers are gonna care right i mean they you're 70 75 years old you don't care if the rate is four or eight on your house you just want to own the house buy the house buy pay cash it doesn't matter pay  cash doesn't matter i don't know how many years left i want to own the property i want to own the asset i think that's no small part of what you're watching go on in housing and i think it's going to continue ironically the party that cares a lot about whether it's four percent or eight percent is the us government and they're not going to let they can't afford eight percent and so at some point they will cap it at whatever rate they're going to cap rates at the fed will and that will only add to the inflationary fire so a little bit of a longer explanation but i think it's important from ken do you think there is an opportunity to trade bonds in the short term as rates could drop as the long bond sniffs out a recession or is inflation taking over immediately thus rates rise are you buying commodity funds i.e dba etc or company stocks related to commodities uh you might be able to trade bonds uh you know buy bonds here for a a quick reversal but to me that's a picking up nickels in front of a steamroller trade as the old saw says on wall street and i just i don't like doing those for myself i don't like recommending those kind of trades for my clients because well it's a steamroller if you're wrong you get run over um in my opinion it's not just the inflation i think there's a greater number of people not doing the math but i think the bond bulls they're not doing the math i if you have a recession you're going to likely have a default on either treasuries or on u.s entitlements or they're going to slash defense spending unless the fed prints the difference in my opinion none of those things are going to get slashed the fed's going gonna have to print the difference so the closer we get to a recession the more likely we are going to see uh the need for the fed to print the difference and that's what i think you're starting to see this recognition of bonds are now after 40 years of of riskless return uh they're now returnless risk um like i said before either you're going to have restructuring issues in the bond market or you're going to have inflation issues and that's look that's what happens on the other side of a 40-year trade one way when it goes the other way um you know it just i think secularly uh you're getting into a stage of the cycle the long cycle where bonds are effectively uh returnless risk uh in terms of what do i own i i mostly own gold silver uh i do own some copper stocks uh producers um uh in terms of the commodities um uh and so that's that's the extent of of you know my focus of exposure so yeah i said you know could yields fall for a little bit in front of a recession i guess it's interesting you know as we see a little bit of a slowdown that they're not falling they're rising uh at the end of qt which is a little different than what we've seen in prior ends of our of qe uh prior ends of qe is we've usually seen rates fall they're rising which is a little different uh it's a really tough trade to time though and that's why for me i'd rather own assets where you sort of win either way where if you have a sovereign if you have a sovereign restructuring wave because of a recession in the west gold's gonna win if you have higher inflation because central banks won't let sovereigns get to the point where they have to restructure default gold wins uh and that's those are the situations where um you know it's basically gold is where bonds were for the last 40 years except we're very early in the game with with gold in my opinion and i think bitcoin as well there's bitcoin still trading a lot with tech but i think ultimately bitcoin's going to trade uh like digital gold not like a tech proxy from andrew in this week's third tree ring you reference the only politically unpalatable option as being only politically palatable option excuse me as being the fed suspends slr requirements so banks can effectively buy infinite treasuries with no capital charge can you elaborate on no capital charge uh so slr is supplementary leverage ratio it's under i believe basel iii regulations for banks but in april 2020 the fed suspended slr rules which mandate that the banks have to hold a certain amount of capital against every asset that they have um and that included treasury so if a bank buys a treasury bond they would have to set capital against it uh in april 2020 they suspended for a year the slr regulations uh against um against treasuries specifically and it's i think it's actually calculated treasuries account for so much versus riskier assets right so it's it's effectively the capital charge it's effectively a capital charge against treasuries that capital charge was uh suspended from april 20 through uh the end of march 2021. what that meant was effectively from april 20 through march 2021 banks could buy treasuries with with basically no capital against it's basically infinite leverage so you they just buy the treasury put on the balance sheet it does not account against the score that they used to calculate the slr which then implied a certain amount of capital so it's basically being able to buy treasuries with no capital against it it is basically fed qe done by the us commercial banks and so uh that's what i mean uh it's it's really about having the having the fed regulate the banks into a position where the banks help the fed monetize u.s government deficits banks end up okay with it too because they're basically no capital and they're collecting whatever coupon uh on on the treasury so hopefully that clarifies what i meant by that uh from luke if the fed largely finances treasuries with slr exemptions uh commercial bank qe how will this impact the dollar and inflation as well as other markets will it perceived will it be perceived differently than outright qe i think many pundits and analysts uh will say yes this is different this is not qe i don't think the market i think the market will see right through it i think the market will say this is just more effectively more qe call it whatever you want it's liquidity i think it'll be negative for the dollar and i think it will be it will add fire to the inflation and i think some version of that is likely what's coming but i think the market's going to see right through it and in terms of things i would watch for to see uh is i i i would probably look to what i think is the most sensitive liquidity metric uh out there which is bitcoin i think if you start seeing bitcoin start to rip higher um that may be a sign that people are starting to buy it ahead of expectations of some sort of slr exemption etc slr exemption for treasury excuse me and then finally charles how long do you give the us dollar to remain as the world's primary reserve currency months years or decades i give it decades um i think what we're watching happen in real time is the u.s treasury bond losing its status as the primary reserve asset and i think it's losing it to gold it has been since slow motion i think it's going to accelerate from here going forward bitcoin could also serve that role if a lot goes right uh but right now gold sits on central bank balance sheets bitcoin doesn't so let's watch and see but really what we're talking about here is the modified version of bretton woods it's really would be the the keane's proposal at bretton woods to have a neutral reserve asset like a bancor gold floating gold serving as that role basically gold floating in all currency terms settling settling uh deficits um and i think it's important if gold gold was in the system from 1946 1971 and the dollar was the global reserve currency so it's it's more i think the ending or the restructuring of this post-71 system where the dollar's the reserve currency and the treasury is the primary reserve asset globally i think that primary reserve asset is being it has been being switched it's accelerating i think from here i think acceleration began on february 26th when uh the u.s and europe uh sanctioned russian central bank reserves basically saying fx reserves are not money good uh in extremis and so i think that's going to move that toward gold toward a neutral reserve asset over time we talked about why gold makes the most sense it's on their balance sheet it's not used for anything nobody's going to starve if we inflate gold a lot as opposed to wheat copper oil etc you know silver productive more productive commodities not to say they won't benefit from this but i think gold rises uh more than everything in that scenario so uh with that i'm going to finish up and again thank you as always for joining me on this uh conversation uh if you'd like to learn more about what we're up to or learn more about our tree rings product uh 10 most interesting things a bit of a synopsis ties in how things how it might be fitting with the way we're thinking about things or how it might be contradicting the way we're thinking of things we just try to keep an open mind at any rate fftt-llc.com to learn more about it otherwise everybody have

"Thoughts on oil prices, Fed pivot, Yen v. 10y UST yield correlations",2022-08-24 14:00:02+00:00,18,54uDONVlY04,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54uDONVlY04,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope everybody is well it is a wild sunday night here in cleveland the uh we've had sustained winds of over 60 miles an hour they're reporting that on the eastern half of lake erie a record 26 foot waves which i would not want to be out there for that so we also had another browns win so we're six and three for the first time in six years so good day here i'm gonna jump right in a couple things let's see first from the uh from the always brilliant chris hamilton question is thoughts on the feds using fed funds rate percentage to encourage unlimited debt to achieve the full employment mandate gaming cpi to avoid any stable price mandate issues effectively resulting in an mmt slash asset price palooza in in my view it's a good way to a good way to look at it is that they're lowering fed funds rate they're gaining cpi or under reporting cpi which is something governments have done forever the interest rate derivatives that expanded so explosively from after 2000. all of this was done in the service of the bond market and in particular the treasury market and by extension the u.s government and so i think in your question or in a separate tweet chris you phrased it as it's removing the free market pricing of the treasury market and i i agree with that wholeheartedly i think that's the whole point and when you look at it the biggest borrower in the world over the last 20 years has been the us government as the post 1971 dollar system has evolved asset price appreciation and and us government spending have become increasingly key drivers to u.s economic growth and so you need lower rates you need tamed cpi uh to keep these deficits from creating a balance of payments problem for the united states as the debt goes higher and higher uh and and we're now reaching a point uh particularly post coven where both of those factors asset price appreciation and low rates uh er excuse me and us government spending have to become increasingly extreme just to keep the wheels on the cart of the us economy of the us's fiscal position as one of your charts showed uh that you that you posted below uh my questions chris so i hope that helps as a side note to everybody on here if you don't read chris hamilton's academic blog you're missing out uh i've long been a fan he always has great charts on there with some great explanations it really looks at economic data in a truly unique manner so check it out second question from ak uh dod announcement shelton finally on the senate docket and the asian trade deal so i i like it uh i like it ak you're trying to go for a three for one here i like like like people being aggressive so okay here we go in rapid fire dod and what we're talking about here is the uh head of the pentagon coming out today and saying in his opening brief that all wars must end and for me maybe it's nothing maybe it's some last-minute positioning for trump uh done by trump as he leaves uh presumably uh shelton remember judy shelton advocated a gold-backed bond as a neutral reserve asset as a way to benefit the u.s and rebalance trade if you had a gold-backed bond the price of gold would have to be marked probably orders of magnitude higher to serve in that role so we wouldn't run out of gold um and so is this some sign of a late term currency system change by trump in trying to put her on the docket or is this just a sort of petty political way of making things more difficult for uh the biden administration uh over the next several years and again let's see i don't i don't know for sure finally the asian trade deal the regionalization aspect of there is what caught my eye particularly in the context of the central bank digital currency points made by louis gavin his really excellent interview on real vision a couple of weeks ago when you pair it the regional trade deal with of of china south korea and japan with a central bank digital currency that allows these countries to transact with each other uh outside of the dollar and swift system sooner rather than later to me that starts to get really interesting that's not where it is yet but you can line these ducks up in a row and see where it's probably going and that to me is something we're gonna have to watch uh third question from bj if the major central banks all build their balance sheets to infinity at the same time hypothetically what is the likely end game isn't it possible that the dollar remains king dollar as long as the above is true yes possible us dollar would stay king dollar in that scenario in that scenario gold and bitcoin would probably do really well as the gold gain would gain likely gain share of global fx reserves because in that scenario if every sovereign is growing their balance sheet to infinity sovereign bonds ceased becoming a store of wealth and so you would see a increase in the pace at which gold would gain share of global effects reserves of global wealth reserves in the private sector and as that happens that would mean more and more of the debt of governments would have to be bought up by their own central banks and then you'd say okay the currencies that do best and worst you'd rank them by the government's running the biggest deficits uh would have the worst currency and those running the least deficits would have the best currency and guess who wins that contest the u.s hands down is number one in terms of running the biggest deficit so that would mean that over time the dollar would be the dirtiest dirty shirt not the cleanest dirty shirt so in the near term if they all debase at roughly the same pace i think gold and bitcoin are uh win and that's why as kirosakolov is so that's that's what makes gold so easy let's see uh from kim getz uh any thoughts on funding stress redeveloping in agency bond markets uh i have not really seen that anywhere else kim so thank you for flagging it let's see how it develops obviously uh all else equal rising funding stress if you're seeing that start to develop that tends to be positive for the dollar uh wild card within that is that the reflexivity of markets knowing that if you see funding stress you're likely to see stronger dollar if you see stronger when you see stronger dollar you're likely and we we factually have seen bigger and faster fed responses to haircut or to kneecap that stronger dollar very quickly said more plain english when the dollar rises each sequential time the dollar's been rising uh the fed has been stepping in with significant liquidity faster and faster so let's watch that again and the it's one of these things is too early to make anything of the funding stress but definitely noteworthy so thank you kim from as the g20 meeting for debt relief and forgiveness for poorer countries was this past friday the 13th any thoughts or insights uh yes it was i haven't seen anything for me it was one of these uh signposts to just see if something would come out of it particularly in the context of the comments of a great reset that we're getting out of the world economic forum out of the imf out of in some of the us mainstream media the informational value to me might be just that they're talking about debt forgiveness this is not something i remember ever hearing about prior in my career i think it's important to remember that over the past 120 years when sovereign debt has gotten as high as it is now in advanced countries it's only been three ways out you either get default or restructuring you get financial repression or inflation or you get hyperinflation that's it those are your choices none of them are good for sovereign bonds on a real basis so i think that's the direction we're moving but of course path matters so let's watch on that front uh from turner may winter trade deficits going to start to matter again or what will make trade deficits start mattering again i think they're already mattering the challenges they're so small relative to the fiscal deficits that i think they get lost a bit in the haze or a bit in just how big the fiscal deficit is and so uh what we've seen since last year whether it's repo rate spikes and then the fed response or whether it's the us treasury market uh going dysfunctional back in march uh yields fall are yields rising as stocks crashed and even in october when you saw yields in the treasury market rise with the dow down a thousand points these are symptoms of basically balance of payments problems in the world's reserve currency issuer and so to me it's less trade deficit driven and much more federal deficit-driven but i i do think they're mattering in terms of what we're seeing there as described and then the final question from rb uh you talk about a bond fire does that entail rising bond yields how would rising bond yields be good for gold it seems it would cause the dollar to rise which is bad for gold in my opinion a bonfire will be on a real basis uh the last time u.s federal debt was this high real rates were negative for a majority of the next 35 years uh and for the first five to ten years after they were this high in 1946 the fed capped interest rates at two and a half percent at the long end and grew their balance sheet and i think that's the direction we're moving and that's why i think it's ultimately good for gold is a bond fire in my view is likely to be bond holders purchasing power getting burned whether it's relative to equities and gold like we've seen since 08 in a very consistent manner i think eventually it's going to be much more consistently against cpi categories as well so with that i'm going to sign off for tonight i want to thank everybody for joining me as always uh if you like

[applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke grumman fft hope you had a great weekend i certainly did i'm going to jump right in here with this week's edition uh from mike luke what do you think would be some of the likeliest outcomes if per se japan and or european nations were to abandon energy sanctions and quote-unquote side with russia out of energy necessity uh i think i think you need to think through it in terms of at least how i'm thinking through it is the short answer is i don't know but and when i think about i think through it in terms of flows and so you you're probably going to end up with for example if japan starts buying russia russian gas in yen uh russia ends up with a lot more yen on their balance sheet you probably end up with a lot more russian and japanese trade as russia spends that yen back into the japanese economy and then you probably need a neutral settlement asset that starts to absorb some of those yen energy commodity flows which i would think would be gold so it'd probably be good good for gold demand all else equal as gold uh gains further share as a neutral reserve asset uh geopolitically um i'm sort of spitballing here but it's i think you'd probably see calls to pull the us military out of japan force japan to spend more for their own military defense uh i think you would definitely see such calls if the eu were to do something similar uh and and so with that in mind from the geopolitical side maybe the most obvious economic outcome would be forcing the fed uh to start buying eu bonds or japanese government bonds uh simply as a way of preventing that outcome of them sort of moving to the russian fold out of energy necessity and to me the fed doing qe on european bonds or japanese government bonds uh would would probably be negative for the dollar at a time when uh sentiment's pretty positive on the dollar but that's all still hypothetical speculative and on the com so from nina if russia exports to europe should keep being shut off how does europe recover economically they very little oil some call while russia is losing a lot they can find other buyers for their gas but for europe it's very hard due to gas infrastructure not being there uh in my opinion to be very difficult for them to recover economically i think europe is facing a uh extremely severe economic crisis we've been writing for months that europe is puzzlingly running what we've called this the the post-world war one weimar germany playbook which is you lose some chunk of your energy inputs and then you try to print money over top of it to prevent the inevitable economic calamity that occurs when you start removing energy from an economy and you end up with very severe stagflation um and so additionally as eu goods get potentially removed from global supply chains due to uh unavailability of energy uh you end up with a worsening global supply chains uh further breakdown of those supply chains in the us and china and japan and that puts more upward pressure on inflation more downward pressure on bond markets more upward pressure on global bond yields and the west is the most levered russia is very low leverage at the sovereign level the west very high leverage and that creates more systemic financial global system pressure on the west now when you look at it from a trade and competition standpoint china's probably not that upset about russia uh putting pressure on the eu or japan in this way everybody's focused on the on the impacts of the of the well not everybody some people focused on the impacts of a weaker euro or the weaker yen in competing against china but china's still buying russian energy these other two aren't to some degree and so while the weaker euro and yen all else equal make it easier for those regions to compete with china if they don't have energy they can't make anything they can't make enough stuff china is taking that energy so energy availability is really the first principle there that's the master resource so um the other thing i would say within all of this is is and i think it's critical in 4q97 early in my career southeast asian economic crisis uh nearly collapsed the global financial system just nine months later through the long-term capital management link um given much higher debt levels uh given how much bigger the eu who is than southeast asia was then an eu economic crisis will likely be more than enough to collapse the global financial system much more quickly than nine months so uh that's something i think to keep an eye on and in that case you know as we move in that direction until the fed pivots i think dollar and maybe gold are the only winners uh from pm you've said before that the system is breaking so why then has the fed not pivoted it seems like powell is more serious than he's ever been an intent on breaking inflation's back even if it means a hard landing recession uh i had uh from this time last year through probably earlier this year really thought the fed was bluffing um i i i thought they understood that the only thing keeping the global system from a severe crisis was the inflation the fed needs the inflation uh to keep the u.s debt sustainable apparently the fed uh is choosing to ignore that mathematical reality so why are they not pivoting yet uh i think it's partly that they're being dogmatic i think it's more that they have been politicized uh domestically to fight inflation by the biden administration and i think they've been politicized internationally to fight putin um to try to sort of break uh break him with the dollar and break china with the dollar um regardless of their motivations a soft landing will be uh i think enough to to break the system i think a hard landing will be enough to break it even faster and the reason that is is you'll see deficits rise as we go into a recession um uh even into a slowdown let alone a recession that sends treasury issuance up at the same time the fed selling treasury at the same time foreigners are selling treasuries because of the strong dollar um and and and sort of unclear demand and that gets you into sort of this this debt death spiral vortex we have shown numerous times in fft which is dollar up yields up everything else down wash rinse repeat until either the system crashes uh or the fed blinks and and has to start regrowing their balance sheet very aggressively from scott is there any level of us dollar as measured by dxy carnage that forces a weak dollar policy pivot or is the treasury hemmed in by oil and cpi or is the fed hem then by oil and cpi is there a cap on this move i.e do yen and euro devaluations in the bank of japan losing the yield curve control fights ever spook policy makers or are there much bigger domestic concerns i think the the credit market problems creating enough dysfunction uh in markets and in particular the treasury market that they have to react is is the catalyst it's the trigger regardless of where cpi and oil are in my view and especially if there's treasury market problems you've started to see um some sort of what i would call pretty weak treasury auctions two weeks ago for example into what we're seeing with um with the economy uh they shouldn't be that weak with with the economy weakening the way it is but i think that in and of itself is a signpost from john uh double digit inflation for five plus years can probably reduce that to gdp to below 80 percent is something you've said in the past is this real inflation or cpi uh yeah in april 2021 uh we wrote that u.s would need to grow nominal gdp somewhere between 15 to 20 percent per year for five years mostly driven by cpi inflation in all likelihood uh in order to get debt the gdp below 80 which is the level we estimated that the fed could then normalize policy without blowing up the system fast forward they began tightening beforehand we've had the worst start to the year in a long long time depending on what you're looking at it's the worst year for the 60 40 equity bond portfolio on record going back at least 50 years so the view that hey if they try to tighten too fast they're going to blow things up it's playing out um so we saw it start to work last year you went from 129 percent to 122 percent at the gdp seven percentage points of improvement in 2021. uh all it took was 11 nominal gdp with eight percent cpi they needed to keep it going they're making a policy mistake by not doing it that's what we're seeing play out in markets um if they keep this up it's gonna be uh the beatings will continue until morale improves dollar up everything else down until either the system collapses or the fed blinks uh from frank if the base case of ty is of tightening breaks markets the economy hurts tax revenues leading to a fed pivot leading to inflationary boom bust if that doesn't play out where or how is that path most likely to break down um politically it breaks down uh possibly um or we actually get some sort of systemic collapse and policymakers stand aside and just let that happen i think you also could uh see some some version of i i hate even talk about this stuff world war famine these types of things um you could see that type of of of of of breakdown uh stop with this it's important i think to understand with sovereign debt levels is high in the west we're not dealing with a dial here we are dealing with very binary outcomes they're either doing enough or they're not there's no middle ground and we're seeing that we've seen that in the asset performance as year to date they keep it up it's just going to keep getting worse until either we get a non-linear decline or they're forced to pivot if you ask me by base case i think they're they may be forced to i think they maybe may be surprised to find a whoosh down and then a a policy response of truly face peeling amounts of money printing from bob do you have any changes in the way you feel about gold have your thoughts changed about the timing or manner in which this cycle ends up no i still nothing has changed with how i've thought about how i think about gold i don't like that it's down i don't lose any sleep that it's down strong dollar and rising rates uh in the us are going to bring forward the day that either the fed burling so the system comes unhinged and either way i think gold is going to be in pretty good shape uh if slash when that happens uh i also still think gold will keep gaining share as a global reserve asset particularly in the commodity and energy trade over the next five years which i think will also be good for gold so i continue to like it um and like i said my thoughts on it haven't changed in any way from brad would love to hear your analysis on when the rise in rates will start to really put a crimp on the federal budget my understanding is while rates were low most of the bonds issue were short duration so they'll turn over relatively soon i i don't have the numbers in front of me i know they've been terming out debt um in other words weighted average coupon of us treasury issuance has been up pretty notably of the last 12 months to their credit uh i think the best in my opinion the best way to look at it is is a simplified way of looking at it something i've been tracking for uh over half a decade now but in 2016 the us's big three expenditures which are entitlement pay goes treasury spending defense they were about 65 percent of tax receipts after just 18 months of interest rate hikes they were over a hundred percent of tax receipts uh in 2018. uh after covet they had 140 tax receipts they're now back down to 110 but they're likely rising again with the decline in tax receipts that is now beginning uh so in in plain english they're already a problem we're already uh rates are already putting a crimp on the federal budget uh true interest expense got back below 100 of tax receipts last year thanks to that nominal gdp growth of 11 percent and eight percent cpi growth but now again with tax receipts rolling over uh they're now likely back above a hundred percent of tax receipts and wills or will soon be so basically you're in a situation where either the fed prints entitlement pay goes and treasury spending right they print the interest uh or rates rise to attract the capital um the dollar rises um and in the midst of a recession and then you get into basically um the high risk of a global debt death spiral uh until either the system collapses or the fed blinks and again you get into a recession with treasury yields rising it's not going to be a good situation for the u.s not be a good situation for anything and i think we're seeing the early signs of this already as we speak and then finally brings me to last question from browning what happens if the fed does not pivot in august as we've said we think fed pivots by the end of august given what we're seeing in credit markets already i think if they don't pivot by the end of august you're going to see the dollar rise non-linearly even faster i think you'll see everything else down non-linearly i think you'll probably see long-dated treasuries bid for a cup of coffee uh and then start to go down with everything else um i think you'll be looking at a serious risk of a market dislocation across a number of markets stocks bonds emerging markets uh commodities housing uh sort of everything so uh we're really getting down to crunch time for the fed to uh to pivot and discouragingly i saw today rafael bostik atlanta fed president talking about employment um employment's a lagging indicator he was talking about employment in may of last year uh that employment needed to get a bit better before we start tightening and we're not worried about inflation he was late on that and now they're talking about unemployment or employment markets still being good so we're not too worried about a recession he's late on that too things are slowing meaningfully so with that finish up for tonight i appreciate everybody joining me as always if you like these updates check out fftt llc.com check

"Levels of DXY or rates that may cause a Fed pivot, Game Theory for EU and Japanese economic problems",2022-07-12 15:38:28+00:00,16,AnmZ8pqS_RQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmZ8pqS_RQ,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope you are all well i apologize we were unable to go live tonight due to technical difficulties so we're doing the next best thing trying to adapt and overcome we're recording this and we will just uh put this online as we normally would put in our twitter feed as well so a big win today for the browns uh two and one winning record so we're excited about that hope everybody had a great weekend let's jump right in here first off from fa do you see rates going higher or lower i see real rates going a lot lower i think one of the biggest misperceptions uh in in markets today are that real rates have bottomed i think real rates could uh easily go to negative five to negative ten percent or even lower the last time u.s debt the gdp was this high they went to negative 14 percent and the u.s is in far worse situation fiscally demographic etc uh entitlement picture than they were then so i don't think nominal rates are going to move all that much though i um you know if rates if nominal rates go much higher you're going to end up with interest expense higher than tax receipts fed has to print them different so the us defaults on treasuries or if you take rates much below zero percent you really can't do that without uh effectively ending the us dollars reserve status because you'll have six to seven trillion dollars in fx reserves in dollars begin to bid for zero percent yielding uh aaa rated reserve assets uh which are also known as gold so um you can't go below zero you can't go much higher without sending ris uh interest expense over tax receipts so i don't think nominal rates will move that much so i root but i really think real rates have much further to fall from ek can you briefly mention yet again why the fed standing repo is so significant is it a transmutation of risk i wouldn't call it necessarily a transmutation of risk i just think it is a it's a continuation of qe without having to call it qe uh and so i think it's important to follow the flows so qe let's run through how that works qe the treasury spends money they issue treasury bonds some of those treasury bonds are bought by banks banks then sell those treasuries to the fed in qe that creates bank reserves understanding repo facility instead of the fed buying treasuries from banks via qe the fed can just repo treasuries from the banks as needed so reverse repo is the fed sending the treasuries back to the banks uh in standing repo the fed the banks can repo the treasuries to the fed as needed and so i think in crude terms the way to think of it is is the qe is effectively a a an addict injecting heroin via syringe into their left arm and so qe is removing that syringe or reducing the amount of heroin injected in that syringe um a qe taper uh however standing repo is an iv in the other arm and it's dripping the heroin in as needed and so to me the importance of standing repo facility is not that it's a transmutation of risk although i guess if you want to look at a certain way i guess you could say it that but it's it's simply continuing qe without having to call it qe uh you're able to uh improve the fed's credibility because they can say oh look we're tapering we told you we're gonna tape we're tapering well not actually tapering uh while still providing the markets and the economy with the liquidity they need to keep those markets actually functioning because they can't function without the the heroin so to speak uh from dm aside from defaulting are there any scenarios you can foresee that would nullify the thesis that the us has to keep markets propped up for years via inflation or revalue or devalue the dollar versus gold bitcoin uh yeah there's i think two big ones uh aside of of sort of devaluation or inflation which is uh you could have a massive productivity increase in uh economics uh in in in the us economy and so by massive productivity increase given the debt involved you would need something like portable nuclear fusion rolled out over the next three years two years at a household level so we're talking about a revolutionary change in in productivity so it's highly unlikely could be happening maybe there's some sort of um manhattan project happening as we speak uh but it's it's a long shot it's a hail mary the other way you can do it is find a way to default on a quorum of uh baby boomers entitlements um and have that same way of defaulting on those entitlements uh ensure that the boomers a quorum of the boomers wealth passes to their kids and grandkids who have a much higher marginal propensity to consume than the boomers do um and and so if if you basically can um sort of renege on boomer entitlements and take their wealth from them and and and pass it on to their kids and grandkids uh in substantial size that too would be a way out of the predicament um from cs the ecb is going to spend trillions to avert climate change and want to top down redesign a green global economy is this also an attempt to kick the sovereign debt bubble up to a new esg carbon credit bubble uh yeah i think it's yeah i think you could say that i think ultimately if you create these green assets then we've already heard central banks particularly in the west talk about a uh climate change mandate particularly the fed and the ecb and so if they create green bonds to make these changes i would not be surprised i'll put it that way i would not be surprised at all if we wake up in a year two years three years and find the need for central banks to do green qe and who can argue green qe because it'll just be good for the environment but that what will be happening is effectively kicking the sovereign debt bubble upstairs to sort of a a global climate change debt mmt project and it could probably work the other thing i think they're doing that people still aren't talking about as much as i think they should be is this i think i think when we hear climate change we should be hearing peak cheap oil peak cheap gas i think there's a an acute supply demand problem uh developing in in fossil fuels if we look out three to five years maybe less and i think authorities understand that and are acting as aggressively they are with some of this climate change stuff as a result of that from bonnie uh you like to compare the current uh upcoming negative interest rate period with the post-world war ii decade plus however that was a time of rapid economic growth abundant oil manufacturing jobs and low inequality none of these apply today correct um that's a great point bonnie so what are the implications of today's negative rates it's a tremendous question and i and i think you're right i think again it ties back if we don't get some sort of revolutionary productivity growth enhancing development in the economy globally and in particular in the west then i think we start to look much more uh we have to look much more uh to the immediately the immediate post world war one decade for an analog for much of the world in particular the west you've got massive inflation-adjusting war reparations uh the germans had massive inflation war reparations uh the united states and other western uh nations have massive inflation adjusting entitlements um you had massive wealth inequality then you have massive wealth inequality now uh you had um you you had de-industrialized economies there by war here by trade policy this time around by trade policy uh you have a massive technological uh advancement creating you know displacing of jobs uh then it was automation and radio and the assembly line and and now it's everything we've all talked about so the punch line to all of this in terms of what does it mean um i i think the u.s situation particular starts to be much more comparable to those of european nations post-world war one so some blend of the uk france germany and russia of those four two of them hyper-inflated the germans and the russians uh there was severe political um dislocations in pretty much all of those places the other two germany and france did not hyper-inflate but the french devalued their currency significantly at least twice between 1920 and 1926 i believe uh maybe seven and the english held out had massive unemployment and deflation until they finally agreed to massively devalue the pound relative to gold in september of 1931. so ultimately i i think the picture is probably uh much more akin to after world war one than after world war ii um is is the answer uh and not post world war one europe um post post world war one um excuse me not post world war one us post world war one europe and from cm are we looking at are we likely to hit an inflation point and flip back to an inflationary economic paradigm if so what happens to different assets um in my opinion yes that's already in process um something a lot of the debt deflationists point to as well that's always deflationary and and most of the time it is but all of the great virtually all the great inflations in history have had at least a component or were outright driven by sovereigns with the ability to print fiat currency trying to keep insolvent sovereign debt solvent and that's where we are they can they can either let some of this debt go away and default on it or they can print money and pretend that the rate should be one percent on on on sovereign debt in the west at a blended rate whatever that rate is um as long as their balance sheet keeps growing so um you've got trying to keep sovereign debt solvent when it's not really solvent if it was allowed to actually be a free market uh that's inflationary over time um entitlements uh these are inflation adjusting we're talking about uh the us is talking about a six percent cost of living adjustment for social security next year right now that's all that's inflationary uh deglobalization if globalization was disinflationary for 30 to 40 to 50 years it stands to reason that deglobalization will be inflationary and i think we're seeing the very early signs of it when we talk about the inflationary impacts of these supply chain disruptions and then lastly something we just talked about cheap oil and gas energy is the master commodity fossil fuels are still the vast majority of energy expended uh in in around the world and if it is getting more expensive to find oil and gas then yes we can have a green response as that gets more expensive but when your master commodity gets more expensive everything else gets more expensive alongside it inputs food etc and so that i think you can also feed into a real change in the inflationary environment and then finally from rd do they actually increase bond buying to suppress yields if they start to move uh in my opinion the bond market is managed has been managed for some time um in a pretty important way i think that's ultimately the goal of a lot of what we see with with qe and central bank balance sheet expansion i don't think they want to go to explicit yield curve control because once you're there i don't think that's the hotel california that once you check into you cannot check out of uh but ultimately they're trying to ride two horses with one ass which is they need to inflate the debt away which requires significantly negative real interest rates but they also need to convince the bond market to basically lie still while they kill it death by a thousand cuts of negative real interest rates and uh uh if the the faster they go with negative real rates the more the bond market will try to sell itself to central banks uh and and really test them um so so far they've done a pretty good job but these horses are riding an increasingly disparate directions and there comes a day probably sooner than most think where they have they're going to have to show their hands they the fed other central banks are going to have to show their hands are they going to inflate it away or are they not and ultimately really the only politically palatable economically palatable choice given entitlements defense spending the fact that u s government's 30 percent of gdp you can't you put the us government into austerity if you won't print the money if you're the fed the u.s gdp goes into a recession a recession with 130 percent that the gdp means the u.s defaults on treasuries it's sort of you know you're you're in you're in deep trouble there so i i think we're quick what we're seeing with inflation um increases the pressure on these central banks and the fed in particular that brings forward that day of reckoning of okay which horse are you going to ride are you going to inflate it away or are you going to let the system crash and really the only politically and economically palatable choice is to inflate it away to supply whatever liquidity is needed so with that for tonight i'm going to wrap it up i want to thank everybody a for their patience uh i apologize for the technical difficulties and we were not able to go live stream with this but uh hopefully it was still helpful uh and then as always thank you for

[applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke growman fftt hope you are well well we are getting into the dog days of august here for the summer in lovely cleveland ohio it is downright soupy outside very humid uh you're getting into the beginning of football two a day practices uh for high schools out there so fond memories of those although not sure i'd want to go back and do them again i do have fond memories of them so with that we're going to jump right in thank you as always for the questions really appreciate it very helpful uh really enjoy uh going through the thought process uh so again thank thank you so let's jump right in first question is from thomas uh has the japanese interest rate rise significantly undercut lever yen carry trades forcing liquidation these past few days if so what can we expect over the coming weeks uh i am not an expert on the exact structure of the yen carry trade other than the general outlines with that said yes you it probably has uh uh undercut it to certain degree and i would expect probably uh more volatility uh in the very short run uh in terms of next few days next couple weeks uh and then more dollar liquidity from central banks when we get further beyond that we take a step back and look at at something that is is starting to present itself in my opinion is a very big problem i think for policy makers and the reason i say that is we're now seeing that if the yen gets too strong it creates a carry trade unwind in the yen carry trade we've we've been harping on that if the dollar gets too strong we will see an unwind in the dollar carry trade remember that's the $57 trillion gross $22 trillion net net international investment position that forers foreigners hold in the us against 13 trillion in dollar borrowings and some tens of trillions in euro dollars uh euro doll obligations so uh you're into this window where dollar too strong carry trade unwind major carry trade unwind dollar too weak against the yen in other words yen too strong yen carry trade unwind which will quickly spill into other effects and so there's only a certain amount of operating room for policy makers and that as debt rises in both nations that operating room is going to shrink um and so my guess is in the short run there will be applications tactical applications of liquidity from policy makers trying to buy time but ultimately what has really struck me most by this yen carry trade on wine over the last several days week is that policymakers globally around the clock this is now going to shrink the too strong a dollar bad things too strong a yen bad things uh what does that mean that means there's going to have to be some sort of nonlinear policy change sometime in the not too distant future i'm not talking about weeks maybe not even months but in the next year 18 months two years uh on current course and track because of these two carry trades neither of which can abide too strong and underlying currency you're going to need some sort of nonlinear policy systemic reset gold revaluation currency devaluation bet big debt buyback uh war uh i don't know polit massive political change with some sort of significant austerity something uh but it's that to me right now is my biggest takeaway on this so let's let's see what what happens go forward both tactically uh and and then more uh a little bit further out uh from gatti hi luke on your latest episode of shift matters with grant williams last month grant compared the seemingly delayed realization of what's really happening to the us in its precarious debt situation with the monty python and holy grail scene on the marauder running towards the castle seems to be miles away for a long time all of a sudden he's right there at the doorstep kills the guard and and goes in and do you believe experienced market commentators and and and policy makers believe this or are are they just ignoring the situation the us is in uh my strong sense is that um western officials at the senior levels know there is a serious fiscal and debt problem uh however they can't comment on it because it would convey weakness uh in what is a increasingly delicate shall we say uh domestic political and global geopolitical situation and and and time and moment in history and so it seems to me possible if not likely that they are handling the us debt and fiscal situation both the senior policy makers and commentators closest to them as a result like biden's declining faculties of the last three years they're pretending it's not a problem they're pretending everything's fine they are dismissing and attacking anyone who says otherwise and the problem is that like father time to biden's faculties over the last three years father time didn't care and compounding interest doesn't care it never sleeps it keeps compounding as the debt keeps rising so there's this great article in the wall street journal from about three weeks ago talking about how um the last time biden met with the house democratic caucus was in october 2021 that the meeting went awfully he was incoherent and that was the last time he met with house democrats in that house democratic caucus 3 years ago they all knew they all knew then and yet they all played along until end of june now i don't care about the po politics of it really because what i'm really interested in is how's it going to impact the macro here with the us debt situation and i think what all of this implies is it sets up a biden likee situation with the us debt and fiscal situation which is to say it's going to go from it's fine it's just a stutter he's just mumbling to oh my gosh he's gone in a compressed period of time except for the debt this time i think it'll cause some volatility when that happens and then it'll be dealt with quickly likely in an inflationary manner uh likely all in a brief period of time like the biden situation was and so there's lots of ways to do this some pl most of them aren't that pleasant some inflationary some disruptive some geopolitical uh but the point is that most investors think well i have time the policy makers aren't worried about it yet they're not even talking about it yet i have time maybe or maybe not maybe it's going to be dealt maybe it's just going to take one bad debate oops he just had one bad debate the debt just had one bad debate and we've gone from everything's fine to four alarm fire so um i think there's a lot of people going to be as surprised as they were that biden's faculties were declining uh about the us debt situation probably sometime in the next 18 months so let's see uh from chris in discussion with preston peter and dany on what bitcoin did you discussed china has been essentially doing the bitcoin trade by swapping dollars for hard assets basically the same sort of thing that michael sailor been doing with bitcoin i understand the water issue in china why they were anti- bitcoin mining but why are they actually bit bit anti- bitcoin ownership excuse me are they perhaps concerned that bitcoin is a us controlled whether uh the satoshi wallet is controlled by the us still or etc and that or even if it's cia something like that uh or and that going bitcoin would be out of the frying pan into the fire still under the us's thumb rather or would they rather stick with gold some other reason etc thank you uh i do think initially it was heavily an energy and water issue uh in terms of china's uh attempting unsuccessfully to ban bitcoin and sort of get the miners out of the country uh probably some cultural issues there as well around gold there's still a lot of um gold is still seen extremely favorably i i am hearing from credible sources that the chinese communist part is now giving tacit approval to bitcoin and the reason i say that is that apparently you can buy it in china on chinese uh uh government internet apps which is to say if you can buy bitcoin on chinese government internet apps the chinese government knows about it and they're letting you do it which tells you they're giving you the wink wink nod nod you know sort of just just don't embarrass me kind of thing so um i heard that in the last few months i thought that was very interesting so let's let's see you know in regards to why before i think it was mostly an energy uh and water issue from andrew comment on international equities these seem generally overlooked terrible trailing 15-year performance really terrible in dollars but better valuations and potentially looking strong in weak dollar scenario i'm ambivalent however as many developed countries futures look bleak uh you know we had a chart last week in the in tree rings highlighting from uh it was great chart by top down charts um highlighting that non-china eem just broke out of a 17-year chop um which is pretty significant when you chop for 17 years and then break out that that is potentially very significant now it's it's probably retesting that breakout over the last four days three days uh but i think for for non china em uh there's a lot of positive things going on that's just not really being discussed in the west uh standards of living arising not not uh uh not least of which is because china is sending lots of very cheap goods there to improve living standards um the belt in the road uh helping that as well uh the other big thing i think for non uh china em is is the ongoing um shift away from dollar denominated oil and and other commodities historically countries could only import oil and other commodities to the extent they had sufficient dollar reserves because all that was priced in dollars to the extent we're seeing this shift toward multicurrency energy and commodity pricing settled in local goods net settled in gold that floats in all currencies and we clearly are seeing that uh that takes the governor the dollar governor off of growth for a lot of emerging markets out there over time now they can't run out of dollars buying oil and other commodities to support their economic growth their standards of living they're all instead of being governed by how many dollar reserves there have they are governed by how productive their domestic economy is because now they can import oil in their own currency trading partner uh opec plus may take their currency uh and then that can be recycled into that country's goods so if you're an unproductive country it doesn't help you a whole bunch but if you are a productive country and you make stuff that uh oil exporters like and need uh then all of a sudden you can net settle in your goods and then or excuse me settle in your grids net settle uh in gold that floats in your currency and let your currency adjust versus gold uh over time relative to the uh uh the opec plus nation so uh that ultimately is very growth positive non-dollar commodities and oil is very growth positive for uh ems around the world that's not sort of a a three-month trade six-month trade that's a structural secular thing years to come it's going to it's going to move slowly uh but steadily uh i think uh and it's something i know uh my friend lou gavis talked about in the past so that's something that that he's talked about so with that increasing trade with china with the growing ability to buy commodities in their own currency i don't think their futures particularly the non-china ems are bleak uh i think they're actually pretty good given that they are creditor nations uh they're relatively low debt a lot of them went through their problems with debt gosh 253 years ago now just making me feel old so i i i do think it's probably worth an allocation for for some of these non um non-china em uh is the point of all that from ts why did real gdp growth grow faster when the top tax rate in the us was 70% or higher uh in my opinion there's a couple of factors at least uh that come to mind the first was that i understand that deductions were far far greater so my dad was an accountant and i remember seeing i think it was under kennedy uh and even before kennedy the top marginal tax rate coming out of world war ii uh was like 90% in the us and so i asked i said 90% tax rates gosh that's terrible he said well you have to understand uh you could write off everything doctors can write off their mercedes they can write off you just everything and so your effective tax rates were often if not almost all the time way way lower than those seemingly draconian top marginal tax rates that you saw in the united states coming out of world war ii through i think at least the 60s uh and maybe even longer um i think a lot of the tax reforms i think i think it was under reagan but don't quote me on that uh like 86 uh did away with some with a lot of those loopholes uh in terms of those writeoffs so you're you lowered the tax rate but you got rid of a lot of deductions uh is is how i remember it being explained to me by my dad uh the second thing is that when the top marginal tax rate was that high in the us uh after world war ii you have to remember the rest of the world was flat on its back um and particularly the developed world right so europe had just gone through 30 years of war japan uh had been destroyed much of europe was destroyed um china destroyed russia destroyed uh and and and so i mean it's it's morbid but of the people that were in 1913 if the number of people in the world that were alive globally in 1913 um by the end of 1945 7% of the number of people alive in 1913 had died during the wars of those 30 years uh most of those in eurasia so really it was you know probably 10 11% of europe eurasia's population died from 1913 to 1945 and or 1914 to 45 and their infrastructure was laid to waste and so point here is that in 1945 through call it 60 the us had all you know by far the most working age men per capita by far the most factories per capita uh immigration was very low um and so the way real wage growth in the us was very high middle class was very strong um and so i think ultimately basically were we were financing and rebuilding the world uh after an unprecedented calamity and so it was pretty easy for us real wage uh real real gdp growth to be really strong uh and at the same time by the way we're investing in highly productive domestic projects like the eisenhower highway system uh space race uh cold war which might not have been as productive but ultimately translated to productive consumer goods later on uh you get the point so i think that's uh a huge deal we we didn't have to compete with anybody um and you know beginning in the ' 60s we started to have to starting with the germans and the japanese and so on so forth so hopefully that offers at least some context i don't know that that's full answer but i think it's a pretty good partial answer um from m still think no recession and the impact on bitcoin yeah i still don't think we're going to have a recession i think these last three four or five days in the market i think we just got a little glimpse of how a recession a nominal recession not necessarily a real recession but a nominal recession would have to look so uh japan banks blow up nothing nothing is done they they contagion over to either european and us banks um us banks start to suffer due to contagion somehow um as that happens the fed then just says and we're not going to we're just going to let them all we're going to let the chips fall where they may and oh by the way if you have $250,000 in a bank uh anything over that we're not guaranteeing uh have a good day and then you have bank runs um you know making the banks dump treasuries to refund the bank runs now rates go up in this recession it is the worst great depression possible it is the hardest hard landing there is and so the bottom line is i would never say there's no hard nominal recession could happen but i would say that the option is not hard landing of plain vanilla recession it is catastrophe hard landing like the plane into the ground at 90° angle and 600 mph or no recession nominally those are the two cho choices here based on the fiscal debt etc setup so uh continue to think nominal recession is highly unlikely not least of which because the deficit is still running at 7% of gdp in the us uh what does it mean for bitcoin i think ultimately it's hugely positive for bitcoin uh bitcoin as as we all know is volatile it's likely continue to be volatile and to me it continues to be the last function smoke alarm so if if you don't like the volatility in bitcoin you're too big get smaller if it if it keeps you up at night you're too big get smaller um and that's that's how you manage it uh to me i think about bitcoin as a option on the fiscal situation that seems mathematically inevitable except i don't have to pay a time burn it it doesn't have a time decay it just has volatility and i can manage the volatility with position scaling um and and position sizing so uh if you're unlevered the volatility is what it is and and you're going to get in my opinion uh option like payoffs on the upside which we've seen bitcoin do in compressed periods of time over the past well its whole lifetime really but without the option time decay so the the tradeoff is that volatility which is just a pos position sizing issue and and don't use leverage so those are those are my thoughts there and then the final question from g oil has not been moving in the direction you've predicted for the past nine months what's your conviction level now and are you more aggressively buying so uh i've been writing for at least the last six seven months uh i expected oil to trade between $70 and $90 a barrel in a range $90 because that's the level the us government could not afford because it would blow up the treasury market or cause treasury market dysfunction to be more accurate which we've seen repeatedly and not below 70 uh because that's the level below which us shale production would begin to go offline which then creates a geopolitical uh problem for the americans because it begins to seed the oil market on a sustained basis to to opec and russia simply because once you start shutting shale down it takes uh if you shut it down too much it takes a long time to bring it back to prior peak levels for example shale production peaked in 19 it didn't recover in the united states to 19 levels until 2023 four years so in the meantime uh russia and sai have way more leverage in the oil market um until you can get that shale back up so i think the american government wants to keep oil between $70 and $90 so it's been trading there i feel good about that call i've also been expecting energy company multiples pe multiples to expand as uh markets came to grasp that oil is going to be kept in a range of $70 to $90 that has not been correct that is oil stocks have you i was looking at xop before i jumped on here nothing it's done nothing so that has not happened that has been wrong uh i still think that will happen um it's it's an a sector i still like but it's not a sector i'm i'm uh hot and bothered and in love with um in terms of of just my where i'm putting incremental capital i've been putting more incremental capital into both gold and bitcoin which i continue to think are uh energy linked neutral reserve asset plays so it's a little bit of an a chicken energy play uh there's still that energy link it's not as direct if energy really rips but again i don't think energy is really going to rip i don't think oil is really going to rip i think it's going to be range bound i think the multiples will expand in oil companies oil production companies what i think is going to rip is uh dollar liquidity to address the fiscal situation and therefore uh gold and bitcoin coin i think will continue to outperform over time so uh hopefully that uh uh helps uh clarify the thought process there a bit uh in the meantime we're going to wrap it up for tonight thank you for joining me if you like these updates check out fftc doccom for more information about our tree ring

Asset price swings; How high can rates go?; Which assets would do best if Fed reverses course?,2022-06-07 14:30:45+00:00,15,Njyw9OFbyrE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njyw9OFbyrE,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke growman fft hope you are well uh it has been an eventful couple of weeks since we last did one of these videos to say the least so let's jump right in and we're going to keep it tight today i'm heading down to nashville tennessee tomorrow for the bitcoin conference so i hope to see some of you there as always thank you for the questions and thank you for tuning in let's jump right in the first question is from david can you explain us dollar dutch disease specifically how it has contributed to the decline in us manufacturing and going forward how decreasing treasuries as the global reserve asset can help revitalize us manufacturing so dutch disease uh is another word for a resource curse curse excuse me which uh the current vice president candidate has mentioned numerous times he's used the words resource curse multiple times in the past year uh it means that you as a nation produce one very needed commodity in very large size cheaper than anybody else else and as you do so you gain share of it and the rest of your economy shrivels away and evolves to support that one industry dutch diseas is in reference to dutch gas production uh once upon a time i think it was 70 years ago uh but as the ft called it the financial times called it the united states is the saudi saudi arabia of dollars uh in the short run this is a good thing in the the long run it means the rest of the us economy evolves so that we become very financialized we become very de-industrialized and that leads to high levels of wealth inequality high levels of political instability which suddenly is how can we phrase it very much a highly acute issue uh and it means it's a national security risk the united states as we've seen in ukraine cannot go to war in any meaningful way with any meaningful near peer power without factories that are based in china without goods that are produced in china that is simply unacceptable for a sovereign nation and so that's the long-term downside of the resource curse or of us dollar dutch disease of the dollar being of the us being the the saudi arabia of dollars so you fix it by getting rid of treasuries as the primary reserve asset you settle instead of in treasuries you settle deficits in a neutral reserve asset that floats in all currencies either gold or bitcoin that's it uh what you then end up doing is obviously given the size of the us trade deficit and current account deficit a lot of demand to settle we we're going to need a lot of gold or bitcoin at current prices uh to settle those that means the price of gold or bitcoin of the neutral reserve asset has to go up a lot in dollar terms uh similarly uh our creditors china in particular uh europe to a lesser extent japan uh they are going to uh have surpluses and so basically what having a neutral reserve asset does is rate the sdr basket currencies around the neutral reserve asset based on balance of payment fundamentals countries with big trade deficits and big current account deficits half will see their currencies fall a lot against gold or bitcoin against the neutral reserve asset and those that um are running big surpluses will see their currency strengthen against the neutral reserve asset so basically you will rate currencies based on balance of payments fundamentals on which basis the united states dollar is the dirtiest dirty shirt by far by virtue of the past 50 years dollar centric system so you would see the dollar fall sharply against the neutral reserve asset gold or bitcoin but also against the uan against the euro against the yen um and probably even against the pound although the pound would be the second dirtiest dirty shirt uh of the sdr basket 5 so that's how you fix it as the dollar then weakens suddenly we get out of the uh iou export business we get rid of the dutch disease as the entire us economy is geared to supporting financialization and exporting uh ius and treasury ius specifically and we actually get back to making a lot more stuff thereby uh reducing wealth inequality reducing political instability and reducing the national security risk that is our inability to produce our own defense industrial based goods all right next question from uh pd what's the point of a central bank holding gold if the currency at issues can't be converted to gold great question uh it's a it's a very straightforward answer two parts number one they hold it to restart the system after the system collapses the current debt based system number one in case and eventually math uh uh ensures that it will on some level collapse on a real basis they hold it to restart uh the system those aren't my words although i agree with them those are the dutch central bank's words two years ago uh secondly for wartime trade uh as it turns out we we have a historical example of this if you have a major global conflict your trading partners are not going to take your paper currency for example in world war ii and before the united states was in the war the uk was still one of the reserve currencies of the world the us was dollar was starting to take over by that point but the the pound had been the reserve currency of the world for over 200 years guess what the americans wanted from the uk in return for lend lease and return for loans they didn't want sterling no sterling gold or dollars so wartime trade is another reason central banks hold gold this then leads to a really interesting recognition if we carry this forward there are fears of of world war ii war with china okay let's play that out i hope they're totally wrong but let's play that out given the example of the us and uk i just gave you in world war ii and and by the way we were friends special relationship all that stuff do you think if the united states goes to open conflict with russia let alone china do you think china will accept paper dollars for chinese goods or will they demand gold or yuan and certainly if the united states god forbid were to go to war with china do you think the chinese would take dollars or do you think trade would shut off or the chinese would take gold or chinese youan and if that happened which i think would be highly likely in an open war with russia that the chinese would very possibly only take gold or yuan the dollar would fall i think quite sharply between the two because we simply do not have the industrial base to to go to war we don't not on a big not against a near-pure power a nuclear arm power which then takes us back to the point about uh the the dutch disease and why it's a threat to national security so third question luke would you say that the stock market is currently pricey for long-term investors uh in gold terms yes in bitcoin terms yes in dollar terms it depends to consider the stock market expensive in dollar terms in my opinion one needs to ask oneself a question will the us government allow itself to be defunded by fed rate hikes in other words fed hikes rates and us government says oh our interest expense is so high cut the fence cut entitlements well we know that isn't going to happen because we've seen it already multiple times over the last two and a half years if if the answer is yes they will allow themselves to be defunded then yeah the stock market's probably pricey in dollars too but if the answer is no and we know it is we know the answer is no to that question the us government's not going to let itself be defunded by fed rate hikes then no stock market's not particularly expensive in dollar terms it's it's up but it's not particularly expensive in my view because the risk-free asset off which stocks and every other asset is based is far more expensive right so if the risk-free asset in our capital asset pricing model treasuries us the united states government has debt of nine times revenues they have opab liabilities or off balance sheet entitlement liabilities of 20 to 30 times revenues and they haven't turned a profit the united states has not run a surplus in 24 years 23 years so if that's double a or aaa which is like lipstick on a pig then in dollar terms no stocks aren't particularly pricey they're not cheap but they're not particularly pricey so i think it's important to have that context the denominator matters that we're measuring things in okay next question from john is there a major wall street asset class that you expect to not be backstopped by the fed in a crisis is there a hard asset class you'd expect to not hold up through financial repression i'm thinking anything everything from metals art collectibles land commercial real estate um commercial real estates i think a valid i think it depends on where it is etc however i think is critical is that the fed and us policy makers have repeatedly backstopped the treasury market and again the treasury market is the asset off which everything else is priced and so if us policy makers are not going to allow the treasury market to dysfunction up to an including treasury auction failures and slash government spending to make room for higher interest expense which we they've shown they're not going to do in either case then it it it's the base layer is is going to be backstopped and that's all you need to know everything else should respond in price accordingly which is to say higher over time in a financial repression scenario and the final question from andrew what happens when our net international investment position trends back towards zero currently around 80% of gdp what would it take for that to happen uh under the current system you would either need a great depression a second great depression which is sort of a really strong dollar that basically forces the entire global dollar denominated borrowing 13 trillion or so plus the global euro dollar system 10 trillion 20 trillion 30 trillion who knows uh that would have to unwind which is to say uh the world sells us dollar assets 57 trillion gross 22 trillion net that they own to uh raise dollar liquidity that could get it moving back towards zero the other way is you would get some sort of very significant overnight us dollar devaluation which devalues the global um basically dollar value of assets relative um to gdp maybe and changes trade flows uh but it's really more the first case so with that i am going to finish up for today thank you again for your time uh hopefully i'll see uh some of you down in nashville otherwise everybody

"How we think about a balanced portfolio & Odds of a recession in 2022, Ruble and gas relationship",2022-05-24 15:04:26+00:00,17,IDZbJNQjCsw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDZbJNQjCsw,"[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke growman fft hope you are well in the interest of brevity i am going to jump right in i want to thank everybody for the question submissions i think it's going to be a really interesting discussion so thank you the first question is from jamie could you break down the mechanics of why a strong dollar pushes the us further into a fiscal dominance position and conversely how a weak dollar can help pull the us out of fiscal dominance it's a great question uh it's important to think about what is transpiring in the context of fiscal dominance using uh double entry bookkeeping two sides of a balance sheet so in this case foreigners globally have borrowed around $13 trillion in us dollar denominated debt per the bis and the euro dollar system overall has what is estimated uh a an effective dollar short position if you will of somewhere between 10230 trillion nobody knows for sure but it's safe to say you have a very large effective dollar short position out there so if the dollar goes up if you're short something and the price of it goes up you begin to get short squeezed as a practical matter this does two things number one it puts pressure on any number of foreign currencies and it slows global global growth as the dollar begins crowding out global dollar uh crowding out global growth as that happens foreigners need to defend their currencies that gets to the other side of the balance sheet foreigners own $ 57 trillion gross $22 trillion net of dollar denominated assets including $8 trillion of us treasury bonds in total and so they will sell dollar denominated assets in starting with what they can most easily treasuries and so as the doll once the dollar gets too strong you get into a position where not only will global growth slow which leads to stronger dollar which leads to weaker us and global growth which leads to us weaker us tax receipts which will lead to higher treasury issuance which leads to more issuance at a time when foreigners are going to be net selling to defend their currencies the net effective supply of treasuries rises that drives rates up that drives the dollar up you go into a debt death spiral kind of of like what we started to go into last year in the third quarter when we saw the treasury market crash 20% in one quarter uh it begins to feed on itself critically i think the easiest way to think about fiscal dominance is that is in the context of this uh true interest expense as a percent of tax receipts that we have this number we've cited over and over and over which is gross interest expense of the united states plus entitlement pay goes of the united states as a percent of tax receipts once that ratio gets to 95% on its way to 100% the dollar starts rising as us deficits crowd out global markets and that touches off this debt spiral that then feeds back into the us as rates go up and receipts go down you go over 100% it puts the us into a fiscal dominance position where the fed has a choice stand aside and let treasury auctions fail or the us has to slash entitlement spending immediately and permanently to make room for interest or the fed andor treasury need to inject dollar liquidity print money however you want to do it uh to effectively finance us treasuries us interest expense and entitlements that to me is the most simplistic real politic way to look at fiscal dominance so once the dollar gets too strong it touches off this debt spiral it pushes true interest expense above 100% of receipts because oh by the way as foreigners sell stocks stocks go down stocks are critical drivers of us consumer spending and therefore tax receipts which we saw in 2021 22 23 on the upside and the downside and it feeds on itself so the flip side is also true you weaken the dollar you increase room you know foreigners that are short if the dollar goes down they have more room global growth acceler ates us receipts accelerate us asset prices accelerate uh us issuance falls foreign selling of treasuries falls uh and really the key lynch pin in this is the dollar so if the dollar goes up it's going to trigger this problem and force again this fiscal dominance decision do you want to print money inject more dollar liquidity or do you want to stand aside as you can no longer pay interest and entitlements out of receipts in our our view the answer is always going to be inject the dollar liquidity print more you can't have treasury auction fails it won't be allowed and politically i don't think you're going to be slashing entitlements dramatically um and permanently uh anytime soon so that is how uh the dollar system feeds back uh the dollar's relative level feeds back up and down into the degree of fiscal dominance in the us from mark your view seems so logical and looks like the way out is there a scenario where the us looks to bankrupt the rest of the world with an ultra strong dollar uh there was a view of that i think there still is a view of that um i definitely remember being told by um people with close ties with washington that that was the plan in the middle of 2022 they were going to take the dollar as measured by dxy to 110 to 115 they being yelling in the treasury and that don't worry this will spur and out of other assets into us stock market and bonds to drive those prices up i warned those people close to washington that that was absolutely 100% not going to be what happened rather the dollar would go up the treasury market would dysfunction and stocks would tank which is precisely what happened the dysfunction in the treasury market eventually got bad enough in 3 q22 yellen needed to weaken the dollar to avoid precisely what we just discussed in terms of the treasury dysfunction deb spiral uh fiscal dominance issue uh and so when you think about it that way the try to break the rest of the world with the ultra strong dollar game plan cannot succeed unless the united states government is willing to stand aside and let treasury auctions fail and uh up to the point and including the point of widespread bank failures uh in the united states and globally that are not backstopped by the fed that ain't going to happen in my view uh up to and including nominal defaults on us treasuries and or call it 20 to 30% cuts to us entitlements and defense spending immediately and permanently to make room for the higher interest expense that an ultra strong dollar would mathematically drive i think those things have zero chance of happening so i think the ultra dollar this dollar wrecking ball was tried some people thought it was a good idea right up to the point where it broke the treasury market in 3q 2020 3 q222 1 q23 with some banking system fallout and then again a 3 q23 so uh that's that would be the cost the government would have to stand aside let the treasury market dysfunction and have auctions begin to fail with all of the reverberations of that continuing to stand aside i don't think that's going to happen from michael is there a historical press president when foreign central banks elected to or were forced to sell treasuries in response to us monetary or fiscal policy is it directly relevant to the present situation so uh we've seen when it's been forced recently 2015 you saw china selling uh in particular a lot of treasuries to defend their currency uh more recently or excuse me a little bit further back in 1968 you saw foreign creditors of the united states primarily centered in europe at that time begin to say here's our dollars we want gold in response to us guns and butter deficits uh and ultimately there is a view that those actions forced the us to close the gold window forced the us out of vietnam or to begin winding down the escalations certainly uh to bas basically as a result of the pressures those things were putting those uh foreign policy uh moves were putting on the us fiscal position uh i don't think i i think the first example from 2015 is still very relevant per the prior two points dollar gets too strong foreigners own $8 trillion in treasuries they're going to sell them to defend their currencies and the problem is that the treasury market given its size given relative uh balance sheet availability in the private sector uh the treasury market's gotten pretty el liquid and so ultimately at a time when we already have a fiscal problem when the dollar gets to strong net effective treasury supplies which is us issuance plus foreign selling to defend its currency will get very big very fast cause treasury to get very treasury market to get very disorderly very quickly so uh it is it can still happen by virtue of a stronger dollar i think it is still informative directionally uh but we've seen what happens when the stronger dollar forces this treasury selling uh really since 2018 um further furthermore we can see echoes of the 1968 moves with what china uh and russia and others have been doing which is uh sell treasuries buy gold um but we are not on a gold standard like we were in 1968 so ultimately uh the fed and/or us authorities can print dollars to cover over any gaps in the fiscal situation which has is precisely what has been happening if we go back to 2014 when global central banks stopped growing holdings of treasuries uh and began buying gold in theory that's that's very similar to what happened in 1968 back then we had to get off the gold standard and we inflated um after we went off the gold standard this time we can see the fed's balance sheet 2014 versus 2024 uh it's it went from 4 trillion forign change trillion in 2014 uh to what 89 trillion at peak so fed and the us banking system uh have taken up a lot of the slack in terms of financing us deficits once global central banks stopped doing so on net in the third quarter of 2014 so again it's not directly relevant the 1968 situation but it is i think directionally informative which is to say when push comes to shove they're not going to cut defense they're not going to cut entitlements they will if they have to grow fed balance sheet directly by proxy or weaken the dollar and that's what we've seen consistently happen for the last 10 years from john do you see a realistic scenario where a us market crash financial crisis happens for an extended period of time or is it more likely to be like march 2023 where the fed treasury come up with a new program on a sunday and markets barely sell off and john shared a really interesting table showing the 1929 crash it took the s&p 25 years to come back 70 stagflation 8 years to come back tech bubble in 2007 years to come back nominally uh 08 gfc 6 years to come back nominally 2022 fastest rate hikes in history in a banking crisis two years only uh in short no i don't i don't foresee a realistic scenario unless unless the united states is willing to stand aside and let treasury markets dysfunction to the point of con sustained treasury auction failures that drive interest rates up and force the us government to slash defense and entitlement spending to make room for interest payments i see zero chance of that happening now i think it's it highlights a really important point which is a lot of people say hey the 29 crash the dow fell whatever 85% from 29 to 33 but the dollar was pegged to gold at 20 bucks an ounce so the dow didn't fall against the dollar the dow f dow fell against gold 85% the dow's down 20 % since summer 2019 in gold terms up in dollar terms uh it's down the dow is down 60% 60% since 2000's peak in gold terms obviously it's up massively in dollar terms uh the dow is down 50% since 1966 in gold terms obviously up massively in dollar terms so uh now purists will say well that's not a total return index and there's something to be said for that uh with that said yes it's not a total return index but in that case especially with valuations where they are wouldn't it make more sense to own gold plus t bills uh because really the total return difference is the dividend yield right so um you know given these valuations gold plus t bills probably uh these valuations on stocks gold plus t bills probably will do pretty well uh over the next call it decade so again i think it's really important to break down what are we talking about here what's the currency what's the underlying currency in gold terms yeah we could have a long long duration uh i mean we have had a long duration in terms of the time to recover nominally in gold terms in dollar terms i don't think that's likely at all particularly given what we've highlighted repeatedly which is that the us fiscal situation cannot abide a sustained decline in dollar terms of us stock prices full stop it's too important to marginal consumption too important to marginal tax receipts which we saw confirmed in 2023 stocks went down 2022 deficit doubled from a trillion to 2 trillion hume with us bankruptcies hitting the highest level in 14 years commercial real estate defaults rising unemployment and a global slowdown when does everyone acknowledge were're in a recession what forces this realization wholesale bank failures i made a comment and someone else asked about it in on on a couple uh different uh conversations in the blogosphere recently i don't think there's going to be a recession and the reason i don't think there's going to be a nominal recession is that us federal spending is 23% of gdp in april and may federal outlays were up 23 and 22% % respectively year-over-year 22% time 23% that's 5.1% nominal gdp growth annualized just driven by the federal government the other 77% of the us economy that is the private sector that everybody's watching and that is absolutely slowing would have to fall by about 6 to 7% just to have flat headline nominal gdp now is the private sector slowing sure is it slowing 6 to 7% or is it down 6 to 7% there's no way there's absolutely no way and and for context in the great financial crisis us gdp fell 3% over your full full year just to give you an idea of the kind of private sector crash you would have to have to offset 20% plus increases in federal spending now will federal spending keep it going at this pace well probably entitlements are 3.3 trillion and they're growing 8 to 12% a year that right there is almost what one and a half per of gdp all by itself uh interest expense we're we came into the year at 3.1% interest rates on average uh i think we're at 3.4 now maybe but we're moving to the front end you're repricing the entire debt stack from front to back uh it's entirely possible that 35 trillion of debt interest at whatever it is now a trillion trillion one probably keeps growing at a two you know 20% clip for the next year um as you reprice all that debt $1.1 trillion is about 4% if you grow 20% there's another percent of gdp growth right there so i don't think people have been paying nearly enough attention to us government spendings impact on growth uh visa via recession i certainly wasn't early on uh warren mosler really uh turned my head to that reality we can look through this with a pretty simple thought experiment $35 trillion in debt right take take fed funds to 10% that's $3.5 trillion in interest expense pro fora if you're doing it that's that's 12% of gdp you' have 12% gdp growth right there it would be all interest expense it would be enormously regressive but be no recession uh you' might have a private sector recession but you have a very you'd have it's basically co all over again $3.5 trillion dollar in interest simmies over a shrinking private sector that's not deflationary um it's it's it's very soviet actually so uh i don't think we're going to get a nominal recession and i think what we're seeing in terms of what markets are doing is beginning to realize that how would markets react to that simple you can't own long-term bonds in that world you can't how can you possibly own long-term bonds in that world so you're going to start to see the $130 trillion bond market come to the realization oh my gosh the rules are different 120% debt to gdp in the world's reserve currency with 7% structural deficits at full employment in the world's reserve currency i can't own long-term sovereign debt i need to get into assets that better hold purchasing power stocks gold bitcoin commodities and so you're seeing the value of these harder assets relative to long-term bonds you can call up a chart call up s&p over tlt the long bond uh the long bond etf call up nasdaq over tlt call up gold over tlt call up bitcoin over tlt it's all the same chart they're all hockey sticking which is exactly what you'd expect to see in the environment that i just laid out is happening from dan my question is will it ever really end empires prior followed a pattern of downfall but don't make me say it this time is different with a world so interconnected and dependent on the dollar slow inflation forever s&p 50,000 one day yeah p 50,000 one day sure but per my prior point in that world you're tough s&p 50,000 in the world you're describing that's gold 80,000 right that's a point that's that's the ratio of gold to s&p in 2009 uh bitcoin's probably a million in that world half million dollars or a million in that world uh that's sort of this financial reparation world now slow inflation forever impli that the $130 trillion bond market full of very smart people will sit still and year after year watch its purchasing power destroyed in my opinion that's not going to happen we can already see it not happening per the hockey sticking charts of those harder asset classes over tlt i just described uh but here's the key nobody knows what the trigger is to spook the bond market it could be a fiscal report it could be an election outcome who knows you just don't know the math everybody knows the math and everybody's looking around waiting for somebody else to panic first the one thing i feel very strongly about though and this will be very difficult if you're trying to trade a month a book month to month because you can't care about this until it's right there but slow inflation forever implies that $130 trillion bond market managed by very smart people are going to sit around and let their wealth collapse slowly on a real basis over time in my view that's simply not going to happen and it won't matter until it matters from travis can you do a thought exercise to explore whether the us is intentionally trying to move away from being the reserve currency and what would be the motivation there have been some bis and imf statements over the years that lead some to believe this i do not believe the us is trying to and the reserve currency status of the dollar in my opinion i do think parts of the us establishment have been trying to change the primary global reserve asset of treasuries uh essentially uh by discrediting them as a safe haven asset for foreigners the russian fx reserve sanctions is a perfect example the reason parts of the us are doing this is simple the united states has us dollar dutch disease you can find an article about this in the ft in 2019 we are the saudi arabia of dollars which means we have gotten very good at producing dollars but we're not uh very good at producing much else anymore that is all fun in games early on but then when you have to fight a war in europe against russia who's on10th your size of gdp and all of a sudden you find the russians are out producing you you can't make shells and missiles enough and suddenly your prize manufacturing asset arguably boeing airplanes are suddenly having all sorts of manufacturing problems why because who wants to go into engineering and study all that calculus when you can do business and get a a quick mba and you can start creating credit default swaps and it's very profitable um it's much easier uh to financialized everything that is the dollar this this dollar dutch disease and so uh ultimately it has become a matter of us national security to re sure the defense industrial base that has been hollowed out by the terms of having the primary global reserve asset be treasuries this is understood at a high level in washington by some people and so i think ultimately no the the dollar is going to remain the reserve currency for a long time to come the us treasury bond is already losing its status as primary global reserve asset to gold you can see that in the data at the central bank level there's no question i think that's going to continue i think it's very good for the price of gold i think it's very good for the united states i think it's very good for inflation i think it's very bad for long bonds on a real basis because again the united states cannot afford for rates to just go up and up and up they will be managed probably by the central bank or its proxies via regulation etc that is inflationary overtime from josh hi luke can you speak more about the jacob fuger investing philosophy you spoke of last year 25% gold 25% cash 25% stocks 25% real estate i'm hoping for a bit more spelled out how to build that portfolio uh look i think you want to own 25% physical gold bullion um different locals um i think cash or essentially us treasury t bills uh along with uh cash in the bank uh in terms of 25% stocks uh i think you want positive free cash flow good balance sheets good franchises that's what i am looking at uh i i think in terms of the gold allocation i think it's fair to say hey 25% gold 5% bitcoin 20% gold 5% bitcoin within that uh absolutely and uh in terms of real estate i think ultimately cash flowing is better uh luxury real estate um in areas that have some sort of um uh attractiveness to them right lakefront houses certain areas um location location location with real estate right so that that's how i've always thought about that um that fuger portfolio from george if a tier 2 country were to have an fx crisis by year end which one uh i don't know but what i would do is i would look at the energy importers i would look at those with twin deficits and then i would look at those that have a relatively low positive net international investment position or reserve position as a percent of their gdp um and whatever you get by running a search or a sort on that list at the top of that those would be your candidates that that probably um run into trouble on the fx side first from jason is real estate in the nations where bonds don't pay more than inflation acting somewhat as a bond proxy duration you know durable won't go bankrupt plus coupon is the rent plus non-fixed face value uh unlike bonds it's pretty common in east asia where people save an overpriced real estate rather than putting money in a bank yielding unattractive returns uh in my opinion yes that's exactly what's happen happen in particularly in luxury or sort of finite type real estate um that have lower carrying costs uh from wilson could the us return to a gold standard again and if yes what are the short-term and long-term implications of it what would the gold price have to be in that case in my opinion the united states will not go back to a gold standard i think there's zero chance of that uh i do think gold is becoming a new neutral reserve asset for settling net energy and commodity related deficits globally regardless of what the united states thinks or wants to do uh gold as a result is up 4x since 2008 in oil terms it's gone from about 8 barrels an ounce to about 30 32 barrels an ounce and i think that number will ultimately move towards 100 barrels an ounce maybe more over time 200 barrels an ounce possible certainly uh i think gold could also be used as a sweetener if you will for long-term us treasury bonds uh judy shelton has talked about this in the past we talked about it in our last video essentially um you would issue longer term treasuries at a very attractive interest rates with the inflation risk of those bonds assuaged by uh a little gold sweetener at a floating price in other words you can buy treasuries at a low rate if you've got a gold kicker that compensates you for the inflation risk since the bond itself only has inflation risk no credit risk so uh to do that the price of gold would have to go up a lot uh i think the right way to think about that directionally is this point we've made in the past which is us foreign official gold as a percent of foreign held treasuries outstanding uh long-term average is 40% 1989 it was 20% uh at the highs when there was an honest to goodness dollar crisis in 7980 it was 135% today it's 7% so just to get to the lows of the last 50 60 years of the market value of us official gold as a share as a percentage of foreign held treasuries you would need gold to rise 3x uh you'd need it to rise 6x to get back to the long-term average and if we actually had a dollar crisis like you had in 79 and 80 uh that would imply 19x so uh that's how i've thought about in terms of how gold's re-entering the system and what that could potentially mean for the price from s luke in your last video you said to avoid debt like the plague assuming you can pay the interest wouldn't you want to borrow fiat goong gold with appropriate caveats i.e not on margin but on being able to term out the debt like taking out a second mortgage or something uh no and i i once thought that and then my friend dan oliver had that brilliant chart shared uh a few years back i've shared it a number of times with clients which shows the price of gold in viar german reich marks over time and it basically went from zero to a trillion reiches marks uh over a span of four or five years overlaid with the month-over-month price change in german viar reichs marks as the currency hyperinflated to zero against gold and what that chart showed was that if you were levered long gold in one of the great hyperinflations of all time you lost all your money four or five different times in four years because the volatility was so face peeling these are political situations four or five different times people in viar germany as the currency was going to zero against gold dumped gold to buy reich's marks because they believed the equivalent of the german government's going to cut spending or the latest war reparations under the daw plan is is is going to reduce the burden or the reich's bank going to do qt or they're going to fight inflation blah blah blah blah blah and blah blah blah blah blah here again the fiscal situation is a fiscal situation the balance sheet is the balance sheet you want to know what's going on now look at the income statement you want to know the future look at the balance sheet so no don't i don't want to be levered long that's why i want to avoid the plague we are now into one of these political situations take a look around it's getting very political and unfortunately i think it's going to get a lot more political and then finally from mel recent unrest in kenya sparked by a finance bill that would have raise taxes to payback imf loans is this sign of things to come is the global sovereign debt bubble finally coming home to roost with innocent canyons dead on the street some of the first real casualties of too much debt who or what is next uh possibly sadly you've got a mix of lots of sovereign debt you've got scar sl scarcer sl dearer resources peak cheap oil uh you've got a situation that is historically uh rare of a rising power versus an incumbent the the the thusi trap uh dynamic uh you've got very major mistakes made by very powerful people and policy makers in the incumbent places anglo-american and and western governments in particular when you blend all those things up together you have a very toxic political and geopolitical combination and so uh this speaks to the prior point i just made about things are political they're going to get more political ultimately when you have these situations when you have that toxic combination maybe the strongest conviction way to play that is avoid long-term western sovereign debt with that toxic combination the last thing you want to do is loan money to those governments for long periods of time when they need negative real rates just to keep the situation together so that's my key takeaway so i'll leave it at that as always thank you very much for joining me it was great catching up and if

"Why USD will likely remain global reserve currency, Gold price action update, & more",2022-05-11 13:34:11+00:00,12,TJfLIbhTDCM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJfLIbhTDCM,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke growman fft hope you are well today is a very big day here it is mrs fft and my 25th wedding anniversary so very exciting stuff i'm going to jump right into the questions as always thank you for submitting them really enjoy the interaction very thought-provoking so thank you first question is from eric what is your take on judy shelton's suggestion of us treasury gold bonds for the long end uh in my opinion her suggestion makes perfect sense uh ent al uh creating long-term bonds that would have some sort of gold convertibility to them in in whole or in part ultimately given the debt levels uh it would require in all likelihood a much higher dollar price of gold and so it would amount to a dollar devaluation of sorts uh it would go back ultimately when you think about valuation of of gold relative to the dollar it would go back to my point about or metric of us official gold at market price as a percentage of foreign held treasury bonds outstanding we've highlighted that that percentage is currently around 7% that in 1989 it was around 20% long-term average was around 40% and in an honest to goodness dollar crisis it was about 135% in 1980 so uh we would need likely at least up 3x in terms of the implied gold valuation maybe as much as 6x to get back to the longterm average and of course 19x um in an honest to goodness dollar crisis so bottom line is it makes a lot of sense it would make long-term bonds very attractive uh by essentially uh ending the risk of uh long-term inflation and as such would serve to uh reduce long-term borrowing rates for the us government from trevor does your thesis change at all with a republican or democrat presidential outcome how will so how would or would social unrest potentially impact the bigger fiscal dominance treasury playbook on the surface to me it doesn't matter which of um uh the left or right wins uh i think there's some granularity about where deficit financed industrial policy funds might flow low depending on who wins but i don't really see a a a huge change either way the other thing i think you'd have to watch for is if one side if the republican side wins uh potential tariffs um sear charges capital controls things like that in terms of what could be put into place in terms of impacting policy that's one of these things where you don't know till you know and then we can react but from a bigger picture standpoint uh austerity is not on the playbook of options unless they really just want to sort of clear the decks and start over from liz michael howell said that the stock market is discounted not to the risk-free rate but to inflation citing robert schiller's data so if we have fiscal dominance leading to secular inflation perhaps it's not certain the stock market will rise or rise enough can you comment uh i agree with how's point in a vacuum however i think it's important to remember the context and that we're not in a vacuum which is to say there's a $130 trillion global bond market that will need to run into $65 trillion stock market which i think is happening um 65 trillion us us uh equity market $14 trillion gold market and 1.3 trillion bitcoin market for safety from that inflation and that you're seeing that in the charts if you look at s&p 500 over tlt the long bond etf it looks like a hockey stick nasdaq over tlt hockey stick uh industrials over tlt hockey stick gold over tlt al together now hockey stick bitcoin over tlt hockey stick but very volatile hockey stick so uh my view is in the secular inflation that we are in the early days of you'll see stocks up in dollar term terms down in gold and bitcoin terms basically argentina with us characteristics from ef if the imf or dollar dominated monetary system were to succeed in stopping the bricks plus from moving to a new monetary system how do you think they would do it i don't think they'll be able to stop it but i'm curious how i could be wrong uh in my opinion the lynch pin is russia because russia as long as russia's willing to ex non dollars for commodities and in particular energy there's no stopping uh the development of the bricks plus and the and the multicurrency uh gold settlement platform that appears to be picking up speed uh gold net settlement i should say so in in my opinion if the us dollar dominated system imf wanted to try to stop this what would they do well in my opinion they would start with color revolutions in former for ussr republics bordering russia uh then they might attempt to get those republics into nato and other western organizations and kind of pry them away from the periphery of russia and russia's influence uh they might try to put missiles or arm those states as well uh if that didn't work they would uh wouldn't necessarily be sad if war broke out in those republics uh then that would probably be followed by sanctions on russia but critically it would never oil sanctions they will not sanction oil uh because if they sanctioned russian oil out of the global oil markets with russia uh about uh 10% of global export markets you take away 10% of the world's oil out of export markets oil goes really high really fast and that immediately sends long-term inflation expectations really high really fast in the west which translate to bond market crash in the west really fast including treasury bonds and that is why in my opinion despite everything the west has tried to do to russia they why they have refused to do the obvious which is they make all their money and energy but they won't touch energy that's why because if they touch energy the west will blow up their own bond market in real terms or nominally basically they'd blow up the bond market and then the fed sl other west western central banks would have to print the money to implement yield curve control transfer it to currencies and inflation in the west and they'll be voted out of office very fast so that is the issue there what would come next if proxy war failed which oh by the way it seems like it is failing uh along the borders of russia uh you the next thing i think you would try would be some sort of economic iron curtain where they try to kind of round up and and gather uh friends of the west against the bricks looks like it's starting to happen uh economically though that leaves a group of debtors that don't have a lot of factories uh and and don't have enough energy but growing young demographics against a group of net creditors of those debtors with lots of factories and plenty of energy in commodities uh but bad demographics generally speaking um you know outside of uh brazil and and and places in africa uh the demographics russia china southeast asia aren't that great at least as we look at them traditionally all of this is happening just as we're starting to see or fear or believe however that ai and robotics are going to take a lot of young people's jobs globally over the next decade if that happens suddenly you're looking at you need to start turning demographics the traditional view on its head because now you're going to have lots of young people in the in the west uh they're the debtors they're short of energy and factories all of which is inflationary if you start putting a curtain around yourself away from your suppliers and then you get a bunch of ai and robotics taking these people's jobs these young people's jobs you're going have a lot of unemployed disenfranchised young people in the west um versus in the east where you're going to have a lot of robots taking care of old people and young people protest and and riot and old people as a rule don't so that is a complication that i don't think our leaders are thinking about it all yet because at least in the west they tend to not think further than two years ahead at most and more often two months ahead at any rate the last option frighteningly would be some version of world war iii and in my view it's uninvestable because it would likely quickly go nuclear here uh number one because russia has said that this is existential for us and we will use those weapons if if our if our existence is threaten and number two ukraine has just in the last two years proven that the west cannot fight an industrial scale conventional war against russia and china they don't have the factory base anymore so the us would likely be in an existential position rather quickly and so that's completely uninvestable in my view so i don't want to spend a whole lot of time on but i would only note that the russian sub showing up in cuba recently is probably a bit of a warning sign on that front uh it's probably not the only russian nuke missile sub um on this half of the world so at any rate something to think about for our leaders that seem some of whom seem pretty excited about trying to go um some of the bricks powers into war uh now the us i think does possibly have an ace up its sleeve in this case that's not been disclos perhaps of of of weapons we may have i mean look this whole wrenches cost $200 at the department of defense it's not that wrenches cost 200 bucks is that wrenches cost two bucks from china and then the other $198 have been deployed into dark projects that hopefully have not been wasted so uh in theory we've got some stuff up our sleeve hopefully that could force um a dayton and a renegotiation without it getting to the worst case but i run through this at length because i think it's important to realize we're over 10 years into this process u this isn't oh the bricks just started doing this and we've got another 10 years of runway uh-uh like we're already at you know 100 plus knots on the runway 3/4 of the way down the runway and the pilots starting to pull up on the uh on the stick because they have escape they have escape velocity and the reaction of the west i think is a sign that the escape velocity is near all right next question from alex does your outlook as described in fre rings change if unemployment continues to rise and the us is hit with a labor recession later in 24 early 25 and what will happen or need to happen if the republican winter deports uh lots of people in 2025 to secure the economy and prevent fiscal dominance uh in my opinion an employment recession would mean receipts down treasury issuance up dollar up gold up everything else down at an accelerating pace like you saw in the the third quarter of 23 until either the global financial system collapses and or more dollar liquidity is supplied via the fed via the treasury via their proxies however they do it uh i think markets understand this increasingly and and so if there is a recession you might get a a minor bid for long-term treasuries for a moment as traders unwind any positions they have short-term traders uh but then the long-term treasury market would likely sell off in any recession other words r up in a recession something most american investors have never seen in their lifetime certainly uh in regards to possible policies of the republican nominee i i don't know a i don't think he would do something like that but for sake of argument anything that reduces labor supplies will increase wages in my opinion that increases inflation that's bad for bonds and that could force uh that would that would force more of that dollar liquidity to uh keep the treasury market functioning and as such probably be good for stocks gold bitcoin bad for bonds on a real basis from gary luke are you at all concerned that fiscal dominance and infrastructure spend to become consensus putting too many investors on the same side of the boat uh i agree that there is some uh excitement around uh infrastructure spend certainly the multiples on the stocks are high i agree many more are talking about fiscal dominance but us 10-year term premiums are still negative in other words investors are still not demanding a premium to own 10year treasury bonds relative to shorter term paper uh which suggests to me that the bond market still thinks uh the fed will crush entitlements and crush defense spending uh to keep positive real bond rates and keep bond investors whole on a on a real basis i think that's there's like no chance of that happening so that's tells me um that it's not a crowded trade at all also gold is still a tiny percentage of western investors portfolios as best i can tell from the latest data and i i would also say earlier this year you i was told it's still a firable offense at a lot of money managers to lose 30% by holding gold uh but it's not a fireable offense to lose 30% holding long-term treasuries and long-term treasuries are down 40 50% from the highs so uh that tells me we're still in early days on this whole theme this is not a year or two thing by the end of this secular cycle i think those things will be reversed i think many more investors will be much more afraid of holding long-term bonds and what the real what what the real return is relative to holding gold from kp beyond financial preparation is there anything you highlight with clients or practice personally in the preparedness realm uh wealth is health so number one what food do you put in your body why would you put anything but the very highest quality you can buy even if you have to skimp on spending in a lot of other places food unlike medication etc is the only thing you put in your body three to four times a day every single day you're alive so number one whatever you have to do to get the highest quality food that's what i personally uh go by and that's been regard regardless of of of what my income level has been in any given year and i've been on straight commission for i've been on i've been doing this almost 30 years i've been on straight commission or a business owner that is effectively straight commission um the basically that entire time so there there's ups and downs for those of you that have been on commiss straight commission in your lives uh it's it's quite exciting um the second thing uh i would say in terms of a personal preparation that i follow myself as geopolitical tensions seemingly keep rising and as i continue to hear from more doctor friends of mine that pharmaceutical supplies medical supply chains are dependent to some very real degree on china and and imports more broadly i think it's critical to be in the top physical condition you can be in uh it's a big focus of mine uh if you need to take pharmaceuticals daily to maintain your health that's a huge risk that money cannot hedge if supply chains break down uh so to me it's it's you know can you run 2 miles without stopping can you do 10 plus pull-ups without stopping can you do 30 plus push-ups without stopping etc no matter what your age is it doesn't matter you i just saw rfk jr rip off like 20 straight pull-ups at 70 there's there's it doesn't matter what your age is if you can't do those things that's a risk that that is it's a hedgeable risk but it's it's not hedgeable with money with put options insurance whatever best way to hedge it get yourself in shape eat the highest quality food you can you can possibly you can possibly get from arman uh goldman recently published a paper arguing foreign holding of us reserves remains buoyant data shows it's likely the g7 supporting treasuries versus bricks replacing that with gold what is the difference between a commodity owning nation dropping dollar reserves versus a g7 central bank propping them up goes back to my prior point right you've got debtors without factories and without enough energy in commodities but growing young demographics uh against creditors with factories and plenty of energy on net but bad demographics what does it shake out to so the debtors are buying the debt of the biggest debtors the commodity debtors importantly especially too right so japan europe uh they're short commodities but they run trade surpluses so they have a little bit relative to the us and uk which are just massive daters on a on a current account basis so the us and uk need to borrow a lot from europe and japan europe and japan don't run that big of current account surpluses and that assumes that commodity prices stay low because otherwise europe and japan aren't going to lend any money to the uk they'll uh any money to the us because they'll be needing that money they'll be selling uk bonds selling treasury bonds to buy commodities from the bricks who are taking that money and buying gold emptying london emptying emptying new york to a lesser extent of physical gold wash rin repeat now you get a which we're watching is a is a is a snake eating its own tail in the west uh commodities are being levered by russia and china as well as china's factories to force a rebalancing in the system debt keeps rising in the west there is insufficient balance sheet capacity particular when commodity prices rise they need the west needs to sell treasuries and uk guilts to buy commodities from the bricks who take the surpluses and put them in gold not debt as that imbalance hits critical tipping points the fed etc print more dollars or inject dollar liquidity fed treasury proxies inject more dollar liquidity to support their bond markets which just drives commodity prices up higher gives more purchasing power to the bricks makes the commodity imports of the rest of the west higher not lower wash rance repeat snake eating its tail so uh ultimately look gold's up 4x in commodity prices versus commodi since 08 up 4x versus oil since 08 and i think it's going to keep going higher gold's going to keep going up versus oil versus treasuries and the reason is very simple energy is the base layer to the western debt back system bricks can operate without treasuries and and dollars it's painful but they can operate if you take away russia's oil from the west the entire western bond market crashes very quickly and the western bond market treasury market underpins it's the collateral for the entire western financialized system and what wins then gold who's holding all the gold buying a lot more of it okay so that's how i'm thinking about it and to be clear the west has plenty of gold if gold goes up a bunch the west's gold reserves are going to revalue however that would imply that treasuries are over as the primary reserve asset of the world that's a good thing for the us and the world ultimately it's just not a good thing for the portion of the us economy that has disproportionately benefited over the past 40 years and so still has a lot of political power washington dc certain interests and wall street certain interests okay here we go next question from gr please put some thought around or some some thought context around ai coming too fast the energy required to run it and the pace at which the energy infrastructure can be built out and the lens of a productivity miracle coming too fast or too slow thank you love your work thank you uh ai is a productivity miracle full stop so is china in the wto so if ai productivity benefits go to the 0.1% like china and the wto did by creating widespread unemployment uh across the us and across a lot of sectors across the world just like china ch going into the wto did for us employment in manufacturing then the ai productivity miracle should drive falling tax receipts rising us unemployment yawning wealth and income inequality soaring stock market ultimately it pulls forward uh the debt andor political crisis i would say starting in the west more so than in the east because again the east's quote unquote bad demographics are actually really attractive if ai and robotics take a lot of young people's jobs around the world and disenfranchises them old people don't riot young people do you know who's got the best demographics in the world the middle east uh let's see from stephen how would your investment thesis change if you were investing for a ussr style looting instead of middle class rebirth i'm assuming you mean political and elites looting as opposed to something else it's an interesting question um especially in light of neil ferguson uh this week asking are we the soviets uh which if you haven't tracked that article down i would if if that's how i was investing it would probably be more hard assets and less paper claims on hard assets um i'd much rather have a farm than a 401k and a farm close to me a farm fully owned uh free and clear um i'd also probably focus a lot more on personal supply chains of food of needed goods of energy of personal security and most importantly of family and community relationships um people know who you are and and how you can help them and how you're willing to help them that's if that's what we were heading towards that's how my views would change from max three i guess to finish up here on with a real estate flare from max would love to hear your take on real estate especially residential if trillions of dollars are about to leave bonds why wouldn't they go into houses then uh from david midwestern farmland as investment being that midwestern will be uh is what i've called my favorite emerging market and then from d with the devaluing dollar do you think it makes sense to borrow against real estate assets so i think we are seeing money flow into houses uh and certainly baby boomers uh for example um lots of examples of baby boomers buying houses for their kids remember the boomers have $76 trillion do in assets and a finite time left on earth um look if i was a boomer and i was really wealthy and my kid needed a house i'd buy it full stop and there's a lot of other boomers who would do the same any parent would i think ultimately to help them get started given how inflated home prices have have gotten um in terms of houses i wouldn't broadly say houses i think it depends on markets uh i prefer at market maret and especially residential assets that have scarcity value and low cost of carry so uh lake houses have caught my eye um in part because the lake everybody loves a lake house uh the lake imbus scarcity value like like bitcoin or gold and uh lakes because there's no ocean or desert insurance risks i'm hearing lots of people say out here in in flyover country that have places in florida that are or in south carolina near the ocean and they're getting killed with the insurance premiums and i don't know that that's going to change uh a whole lot based on the bond losses that insurance companies have taken over the last three years so uh the cost to carry on a lake house all sequels lower than the cost of carry on a uh on a place near an ocean so um i've thought about it that way and bigger picture um i think it depends on the cash flows the assets as well um you know if the cash flows from the asset cover the interest plus an acceptable rate of return in terms of borrowing against it under even draconian recessionary scenarios then you know okay you could borrow on it but if not i i i really would avoid leverage uh i'm avoiding incremental leverage like the plague uh because i just don't know farmland i like a lot uh historically farmland prices have tracked really well with usm2 money supplies if i recall correctly from chart from my friend ly alden but again you got to be really careful with leverage um farmland by nature is less levered um partly because they still have pretty high uh at least they did when i owned 100 acres of farmland pretty high uh borrowing uh loan to value requirements so i think you had to put like 35% down if i recall correctly um mandatory that was a least you could do which is a huge difference than the residential housing market around the rest of the country so um don't know if that's still the case i suspect some version of it still is so i still like farmland plus it is an actual inflation hedge because the rent you can get from renting it out to farmers varies with actual food and energy related inflation which is in my opinion the only inflation that really matters um so that's it for today thank you very much for joining me as always if you like these updates check out fft uh- c.com for more information about tree rings and our uh 10 most interesting things

[applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hi this is luke growman fftt hope you are well having a great week thanks for joining me thank you for the questions as always greatly appreciate them let's jump right in to make the most of the time first questions from gary what luke what percentage of the debt market can you see rotating out and entering the gold asset class uh it's a tough question to answer it because there's a lot of variables uh it depends on productivity miracle uh whether it arrives how fast it arrives if it does arrive uh it depends on policy choices uh do policy makers actually let rates rise to levels that force the us government to slash defense and entitlements unlikely or do they keep intervening with dollar liquidity uh every time the treasury market dysfunctions because rates are getting too high or global balance sheet is insufficient relative to the size of us deficits that's much more likely and how do they pace those actions what's the path to those actions directionally here here's how i keep boiling it down western sovereign debt broadly us debt government debt specifically are it's not sustainable unless you have negative real interest rates unless real interest rates unless interest rates are below the rate of inflation the global sovereign debt backed monetary system is also at the same time fundamentally incompatible with the productivity miracle we need to get us out of the debt problem um you get tech deflation it arrives too fast unemployment goes up that creates the same debt crisis so we're caught between two pincers that are squeezing down uh and to be blunt i'm not trying to trade it with my money i can see this happening i don't need to get the timing exactly right i just need to be unlevered so that i can last longer um and i think not what i think who cares what i think what are seeing play out in the markets in the charts that we're highlighting for people the $130 trillion bond market is squeezing into $65 trillion equity market the $4 trillion gold market and the $1.4 trillion bitcoin market uh i own t bills uh i i i think owning short-term government paper is fine but in my opinion mid to long-term western sovereign bonds bonds more broadly i i think they will continue to underperform these asset classes these harder asset classes that will do better in a secularly inflationary environment uh and i think within that i think stocks have been and will continue to underperform gold and bitcoin this cycle we can see since uh uh late 19 that stocks have been basically flatt down slightly versus gold and obviously down quite a bit versus bitcoin next question from chris the the gold to gams oil ratio has now reached one so one gram of gold per one one gram of gold per barrel of oil historically it's historical limit given opec's recent decision to phase in more production does this signal their willingness to push that ratio lower perhaps to the 0. five mark that posar and glazier have highlighted in the past could this be a new paradigm etc uh in my opinion yes uh multi currency oil pricing with net gold settlement uh a symptom of that being pushed forward would be opec running production higher you would do that because you want to get the better currency gold with uh more cheaply before it's revalued higher by oil in other words opec plus would run oil production full out in a multicurrency system net sell settled by gold because remember the oil market's 12 to 15 times bigger than the gold market in annual physical production terms um so you only need a cartel to manage prices like opec when you are selling a commodity in a single fiat currency when you're selling oil for gold effectively which is what i'm saying here you can run full out your incentives are to run full out it's actually very it's great for uh for consumers oil prices in theory should drop relative to gold they wouldn't necessarily drop relative to dollars there in lies the rub so my view is the gold oil ratio is going to continue to rise over time it's up 4x from 8 to 32 barrels per ounce since putin started buying golden 08 i think it's going to continue uh overtime for years to come from cheryl do you think it's true that saudi arabia will stop pricing oil in dollars and instead be priced in bricks or some other currency if so how do you see this playing out in the markets no i don't think they're going to stop buying or pricing oil in dollars i will say i was told five to six years ago uh by someone in a position to know that quote saudi will ultimately do what they must to keep their biggest customer happy their biggest customer is china especially post us shale i do not think saudi will stop pricing oil in dollars i do think they will price oil in other currencies over time and swap whatever currencies they're getting for goods from the country of that currency and you can see chinese saudi trade has exploded in the last 5 years and then i think they'll net settle any amount in gold so we'll see the gold to oil ratio continue to rise it's great for gold over time as i noted before oil's 12 to 15 times bigger than gold annually in physical production terms it's great for non dooll commodity toand if you can print local currency for oil settle with net goods and then uh net settle with gold you're going to demand a lot more energy a lot more commodities so you should see oil and other commodity volumes rise in terms of demand from uh the global south um broadly speaking uh particularly india and china to start where there's 2.8 billion people uh between the two countries that ultimately is why saudi would do this in my view is they need more demand over time and if you start pricing other currencies net settling a gold you're going to get a lot more demand in terms of oil from the global south now that your demand from your traditional western customers is flattening out and the americans are taking some of your market share ultimately what this means for markets is it begins to shift global currencies back to trading more on balance of payments for the last 30 40 years almost everybody on wall street has only focused on relative interest rates for currencies but there's always been a second component it just hasn't mattered in 40 to 50 maybe 60 years and that is balance of payments uh on a balance of payments basis the dollar is by far the dirtiest dirty shirt however as we transition from the rates driven fx market world to the balance of payments driven world i'm describing paradoxically you're going to see upward pressure on the dollar which causes treasury market dysfunction at ever shorter intervals which forces fed and treasury to intervene by injecting more dollar liquidity at ever shorter intervals driving stocks up inflation up gold up bitcoin up relative to treasury bonds and relative to the dollar ultimately on the other side of this on a balance of payments basis you'll see the dollar weaken against things like the yen like the yuan uh in particular uh but that's how i see it playing out both short and longer term from ross if you were the ceo of the united states what would you do to put us on a sustainable financial path uh ultimately what we're talking about here is a restructuring situation so there's a number of ways you could theoretically accomplish that uh you need to get de the de the gdp down to to sustainable levels where the fed can resume being independent uh from treasury and uh really at any dollar level and so right now anytime the dollar gets too strong the us goes into fiscal dominance so the fed and treasury are not independent they're independent asterisk as long as the dollar is low enough they can be independent anytime that dollar gets too strong that level was 114 on dixie in the fall of 22 it was 107 last fall 23 it was like 105 104 last month so that number is coming down over time uh in the meantime there's you have to understand as we think about the restructuring there's only three things big enough to cut that matter entitlements defense and interest that's it everything else is a rounding error you could implement fed financed industrial policy that inflates the debt away over call it two to three years and and that would crush bond holders on a real basis balance sheet probably increases a lot in that scenario inflation probably increases a lot you'd probably need to implement um some sort of flat cola adjustment for social security and then probably ration care for medicare and medicaid in that scenario because healthcare costs are essentially debt off balance sheet in a foreign currency the fed nor treasury can print hips knees pharmaceuticals doctor's time etc uh another choice is you could seed eurasia to the bricks cut military spending by $4 to $600 billion a year bring all the boys and girls home and uh uh refocus our efforts here i don't think that's going to happen but that's another possibility uh the way could also cut rates back to zero and leave them there some version of that i think is the most likely outcome here too we have inflation etc uh you could also do other things you could put and i'm not advocating this i'm just you asked the question i'm answering you could put a 90% death tax on all estates over say 50 million or $100 million um no exceptions uh and they can track that money they track that money all over the world track it down um yeah if they can get uh if they can get elliot spitzer passing a $3,000 check in 2000 i suspect they'd be able to find $9 million of of estates around the world um on an $100 million estate so again i don't think that's going to happen i don't think it has a chance of passing uh but these are the types of things you could theoretically do the easiest and the most politically palatable is simply inflation negative real interest rates and a sustained basis and i think that's what the outcome is going to be which again takes us back to 0.1 mid long-term bonds why there's there's no there's no to me it's just if you want to trade them trade them great but from a secular investment standpoint for the average investor they don't make a lot of sense to me here uh from donan if the stock market crashes is isn't it likely that bitcoin will also crash uh i would think yeah that that bitcoin would see downside potentially significant obviously it's high volatility over time historically if the stock market were to quote unquote crash i think the variant perception that is absolutely not consensus but which i am highly confident would happen is that there'd be pretty significant downside pressure on the treasury market too not yields prices rates would rise in my opinion in a stock market crash because as rece reets u because receipts from stocks as we've shown drive marginal consumer spending which drives marginal gdp which drives marginal tax receipts we saw this in 20 21 22 23 paradoxically stocks were to crash and stay down treasury receipts are going to fall sharply treasury issuance is going to rise dollar will have risen you'll have net treasury selling going on around the world pretty aggressively and i think treasury rates would rise in that scenario which is the fed's worst nightmare basically stocks down bonds down so paradoxically this also means that the stock market de facto backs the treasury market we've seen this like i said multiple times since 2020 but multiple or many market participants still don't believe it yet our take on what to do with this knowledge or how as we often ask how do we make money with this uh stocks can still crash i would never say they can't crash quote unquote my view is they will not be allowed to stay down if it happens for a very simple reason the us government will not allow itself to be defunded by a stock market crash and a stock market crash will cause rates to rise on a very indebted government so you would likely if you saw a stock market crash very very quickly very large amounts of qe and nicely you conveniently empirically we have a test case with co they came in with what $600 billion a week in q pretty rapidly so rapidly in fact that warren buffett said they reacted so fast he didn't have a time to go shopping with his record cash pile he couldn't buy anything the fed acted too fast i think it's very instructional uh so our our view is ultimately that if they're not going to let that be sustained for long why do we own mid longterm bonds as an average investor as a secular investment trade great but like as a mid as a as a secular investment doesn't make sense i'd much rather own my duration in the form of gold bitcoin so uh and i'd rather own stocks than long-term bonds so as as more market participants do understand this uh and i think this the understanding is growing we can see it in the charts uh in terms of how uh stocks over long bonds gold over long bonds bitcoin over long bonds are all hockey sticking uh i think you'll see that drive further bond market shifts into things like gold bitcoin and stocks so from gail do you think yellen is buying as much physical gold as she can under the radar to help buffer the us uh for a potential run on physical in the future future it seems the us is unlikely to have the purported 8,000 tons today or excuse me purported 8,000 tons uh no i don't think she's buying that much gold albert marco who's very tight in uh asserted a couple of months ago that treasury's buying some gold on the margin uh in my opinion it would be on the margin to manage markets to manage the dollar uh and inflation expectations uh i increasingly get the sense that yellen and and much of the us government is really not thinking that much further ahead than either financing the next 12 months uh or getting to the next episode of treasury market dysfunction whichever comes first uh from from kp post great financial crisis 2009 to 11 the long the long bond etf tlt dipped about 25% then came back stronger are we in a similar dip now since 2020 uh in my opinion no uh i think it's much more secular this time deb the gdp is vastly different much higher now deficit is much higher now uh at full employment net international investment position is much different it was only 15% of gdp then it's negative 70% of gdp now um you know note that from 09 to 11 even after 11 even after they started winding down qe we really didn't have treasury market dysfunction post 11 like we have had repeatedly since co um and again to be clear i'm not saying tlt and the long bond can't rally um it could it could if you in the initial stages if you get a real sharp concern about deflation like you know even like what we've had in the last couple of weeks uh it tends to trade with oil so if oil drops sharply like it has in the last week or two you could see yields come down at the long end um little bit of a bounce in tlt off the lows from 88 to 92 in the last week or two i've been keeping an eye on it if the fed does yield curve control and they set the cap at 3% down from 4.35 or wherever the ten year is today technically tltl rally um but you're going to be losing money relative to inflation losing money relative to gold losing money relative to bitcoin losing money relative to stocks in that scenario so i just think it's as one of my best relationships on the street says long bonds are it's blood sport if you want to go in there and trade and sort of you know uh join fight club trying to trade it it's obviously your prerogative but i think that the gd p so high positive real rates we know empirically will drive a us debt spiral we saw it start in 3 q23 for me i just given that i don't think average investors should own instruments that need to fall versus inflation just to keep them nominally money good that makes no sense to me i would rather just own gold bitcoin and stocks that's where i am it's what i continue to uh advise from ken any thoughts on stable coin legislation that will formalize the use of treasuries as collateral uh yeah it's inflationary um stable coins in my view are very unlikely going to be buying 30-year treasuries 10 year treasuries 7ear treasures 5year treasur they're be buying t- bills uh i don't think they want to take they're not the interest they're not in the business of being a bank they would want to borrow short lend long they want to they want to fund long and and and deploy long so um you're looking at them putting a lot of money to t bills so if stable coins become a more significant way of financing the government that implies more government financing being done at the front end in t bills uh reminder t bills are just a small step removed from the united states financing itself by the treasury emitting cash cash is just a 0% yielding bond of zero duration it says federal reserve note right on every bill you have right every dollar bill you have every denomination a federal reserve note that's a bond it's just a 0% yielding bond of zero duration a t- bill is just a 5% yielding bond of whatever that works out to 3month duration i don't know it's probably slightly less than three months whatever it's much more cash-like the more cash-like you are the more secularly inflationary it is so uh can stable coins work in terms of creating demand absolutely uh is it happening it does from the little bit i've studied it looks like it's starting to move in that direction what does it mean for markets it's inflationary it's inflationary which again if we're going to finance more and more in t bills stable coins why do i want to own why do i own mid mid and long-term us treasuries for what i'd much rather own gold bitcoin stocks so those are my thoughts and then the final question from andre could you please offer a review of your investment thesis for the industrial sector current status catalysts this also ties in with a second question i got regarding why i think the us rust belt is my favorite emerging market uh the us rust belt and the us defense industrial base got de-industrialized by the china by the us policy trade policy with china so uh that's reversing it's it's it's it's unmistakably reversing and and as a side note you have electrification uh of vehicles etc ai a lot more electricity is needed a lot more that's an additional kicker in terms of demand electrical infrastructure equipment etc then you have another kicker cold war 2.0 uh that's providing urgency to do this quickly inflation be damned so uh it's it's not going to happen organically it's going to be um given nudges with government industrial policy regardless of who wins the white house biden and trump are both running on industrial policy platform so that's great for industrials it's great for nominal gdp growth it's great for inflation over time uh it's terrible for the real value of bonds and if bonds can't serve purpose gold and bitcoin will and we're seeing that in charts and i think that's still very early days so at any rate that will finish up for the day as always if you like these updates please check

Recession or not? Is it time to buy bonds yet? When might the Fed be forced to reverse course?,2022-04-12 13:30:12+00:00,26,tMgvgDY2qZo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMgvgDY2qZo,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke growman fft hope you are well and having a great week definitely having a great week here in lovely cleveland did have a bit of a setback last night with the cavs unfortunately against the celtics uh i thought they quitted themselves well without donovan mitchell played with a lot of heart so got to tip uh tip my cap to them but uh we're heading back to boston down 3-1 so hopefully we can uh we can uh pull it out but it's starting to look a little bit little bit grin for my cav so at any rate let me jump right in as always thank you very much for the questions really appreciate it let's let's jump right into them first question is from where us sanctions policy impact on the legal basis for the dollar is world reserve currency where will money flee to i think it's important to highlight i think it i think nothing's going to happen to the dollar's reserve status i think we are seeing and have been seeing for a decade the primary reserve status of us treasuries being eroded by uh economic reality real politic and obviously since 2022 us sanctions policy vv russia uh central banks have been moving to gold on the margin over the last decade accelerating it since 2022 since the russian sanctions i think you'll continue to see that i also think we're seeing at the sovereign wealth fund for an official level uh movement into hard assets productive assets domestic infrastructure uh military spending uh when you see those things consider that it it it those that those funds that capital could have gone into treasuries uh at the sovereign level basically sterilizing us deficits financing us deficits instead basically getting dollar surpluses returning them to sender in exchange for realworld finite goods so there's really i don't i don't see any i i agree with the view there's no alternative in the financialized fiat world uh there is an alternative that is being used out of the financial fiat world with the primary reserve asset being treasuries into gold harder assets infrastructure into the the real world out of the financialized paper fiat world from tm any thoughts on the meredith whitney thesis of upcoming silver tsunami which is uh in short boomers own a lot of houses and they have to sell it some point um it's related to housing but really could apply to all assets really um i do agree that you could see housing fire sold in certain markets uh to the extent boomers on average i think actually well above average i think the majority of boomers own their houses free and clear uh when they pass on when they uh go into home healthcare whatever the case may be uh those houses i think the ones that are paid off free and clear uh i think those are basically lottery tickets to the kids uh sell the house mark it down move it and so from that standpoint it depends on market it depends on pacing but yeah i think you could see pressure on housing in certain markets at certain times in terms of other assets and in particular us treasury bonds and stocks and other private assets uh i don't think those will be allowed to fall sustainably uh there will be sales sure and when they happen we as soon as it makes treasury markets illiquid as soon as it knocks down stocks too far we've seen treasury fed react with more dollar liquidity it's intellectually offensive it is what it is i didn't create the system they let the system evolve in a way that the us cannot afford positive real rates for long on treasuries and they cannot afford a sustained decline in stocks so neither one will be allowed to happen dollar liquidity will be the release valve so for me the silver tsunami uh as it relates to stocks and bonds will manifest in periodic waves of dollar liquidity tsunami and possibly even fed balance sheet tsunami in other words the fed balance sheet goes higher over time uh from ab do you see any case for equities or do you see a case for equities continuing to climb up as you've described in your newsletter and a' 08 job market real estate recession in coming once or do you think the job real estate crash is already here i i i think it's any weakness we see in jobs and and real estate is going to increase stress on receipts here in the us and i'm always focused on the us cuz the us is the center of the system and and so if you increase stress on us receipts you're going to increase stress on treasury markets and and then we sort of go wash rance repeat sustained stress in treasury markets isn't going to be allowed to happen they will inject dollar liquidity and so unless the us government suddenly after 5 years of plus of doing this decides they're willing to stand aside and let themselves be defunded by private markets uh triggering basically a debt spiral and a new great depression while they stand aside and watch which by the way i think has zero chance of happening in my opinion you're not going to get a a weakness nominally the re in a recession or a crash in the economy nominally um you i think it's be very hard to have a nominal recession real basis sure you know could the could gdp fall in gold terms could the stock market fall in gold terms in bitcoin terms sure uh but that helps the sustainability of the debt that's a negative real rate that's your money goes less far buys you less stuff you're getting less stuff so that's a real recession uh but nominal gdp is not falling and when when you have nominal recessions um or when you have real recessions but nom strong nominal growth it feels much more like a boom uh asset price is up etc job markets tight what have you from la what parts of your core thesis are you more sure of and less sure about and why i am more sure the us will not abide treasury market dysfunction for really any sustained period of time i'm more sure they will not abide stock price declines on a sustained basis for really any period of time uh i'm more sure that reshoring and moving away from china is secularly inflationary um i am less sure that the us can reshore in time and that even if they do that it's not already too late that's something that's really kind of come to me over the last 2 3 months based on some of the things i've seen uh something that is i'm l sure of but that there's not really a cause for is is that russia does not have some sort of political turnover uh calamity that results in us dea facto control of russian resources like we had basically under yelton like i said i i don't have a reason for that but that's something i just don't have great visibility on so those are a few of the moving parts within um the broader view that i think i i feel more strongly and less strongly about uh from jl without change to our fiscal policy how long do you think we have until the us implodes uh i think it's really important to to to break down the word implodes what does that mean uh i've often said what's normal for the spider is chaos for the fly uh what we have seen since 2020 for bonds is an implosion you've seen a a significant drop in the price of bonds you've seen a significant drop on top of that in real terms for those bonds we've had that implosion um my view is that bonds will continue to deteriorate on a real basis uh i don't know on a nominal basis it kind of depends right you take take a an extreme case i think it might end up happening but it's an extreme case as we sit here today fed does yield curve control and they say 10year treasury yields are going to be capped at four right now 10 years at 4.48% so the yield would go up 48 bas points or down 48 basis points excuse me bonds price would go up actually decent amount but the underlying inflation inflation in the us would be double digits uh asset price stock prices would be soaring gold soaring bitcoin soaring houses soaring economy soaring so you'd be losing the bonds would be re imploding on a real basis but you'd actually be making money nominally your statement would come to be green uh so on a real basis um it really comes to is thinking real basis nominal basis when we think about the word implosion and and and and knowing that it is a matter of us national security it's a and that the us government funding goals funding needs for about goals funding requirements require that bonds continue to lose money on a real basis sustainably uh if you don't have a productivity miracle to me that's the more likely pressure we're going to see is ed pressure uh at various paces on the real value of bonds uh in particular long-term government bonds so hope that helps in terms of just kind of the thought process about we're watching and the fiscal situation that we're seeing the more the the more acute it gets the more the dollar goes up the more acute it gets the more rates go up the more acute it gets uh the more inflation goes up the less acute it gets but that puts pressure on the bond markets um and pressure on the fed to uh uh uh help sustain and or or or or shortcircuit any dysfunction treasury to shortcircuit any dysfunction so the fiscal situation being what it is the operating room is getting smaller and smaller and smaller and ultimately our destination which we should not be arri surprised when we arrive at is some version of yield curve control probably unlikely to be explicit yield curve control but the facto yield curve control which is it will be an employ expion for the real value of bonds but what it's going to feel like is a really good economy you're going to see gd nominal gdp running 8 10% in america you're going to see cpi running 8 %. you're going to see in you're going to see stocks uh you probably see a bit of a sector rotation but again if real rates are negative maybe not that much of a sector rotation you'll be seeing a fleeing out of you know $130 trillion in bonds looking for a home in $65 trillion of dollar equities uh looking for a home and $4 trillion of gold $1.2 trillion in bitcoin you get the point so i for me i think the pressure has been all it's already started on a real basis and i think it's going to continue from nf how would you approach the construction of a rust belt emerging market etf uh appreciate the question i i uh said something on x yesterday that my favorite emerging market remains the the us rust belt uh i would probably just do a a a a conglomerate of of electrical infrastructure industrials energy production across a number of different sources so gas oil um industrials like i said semiconductors uh very big intel plant going up down in columbus eventually uh they've got labor tightness uh water and and then i think grains too both obviously we grow a lot of grains here in in flyover country rust belt flyover country and there's a tie-in with energy there's a very big liquid fuels infrastructure based off of ethanol ties speec grains so uh from gh luke i heard a narrative recently that fiscal dominance is diminishing in 2024 because the fiscal spending that was geared toward injecting cash into households has declined significantly recently do you think this idea has merit uh i think it depends on the level of the dollar the higher the dollar the more we're going to be in fiscal dominance and vice versa uh holding the dollar steady as a consideration no i don't think the idea has merit uh interest so in co interest rates were zero so interest expense was really low and we had trillion dollars in stimmy more direct to households trillion dollar deficit plus the low level of interest now we have high interest trillion two no real stemmi um but deficits are deficits it's the same dollar deficits they're not that much different in terms of dollar amounts uh the difference is that the stimmy to a household is like a heroin injection into the jugular whereas the interest expense deficit defense spending deficit tends to bleed into the economy on a little bit more gradual basis more like sort of a a drip i but you're comfortably numb either way so uh to me it's really just a question of how fast those deficits get into the economy and i think it's partly the reason why all of a sudden we're starting to see inflation secularly rise again as the drip starting to take effect uh from sc hi luke i'm a subscriber big fan of fftt thank you and thank you for your business my question is what is going on with the japanese yen and could this be a catalyst for a major credit event uh left to its own devices yes in my opinion uh we've been highlighting for clients for a number of years we've put it on x a couple of times recently 10-year treasur yield for the united states against the dollar yen and the weaker the yen gets the higher 10e treasury yields go and so we've seen some people saying yen's going to go to 180 against the dollar maybe and if the correlation holds that implies a 6 and a half or 7% 10year treasury y that's going to be a credit event like no other uh seen some people say the y could go to 200 ultimately again maybe but if it does and that and that and that relationship holds and i think it will given the united states net international investment position being as high as it is in other words foreigners have a lot of dollar assets to sell to defend their currencies if the relationship holds 200 yen is like 9 10% on the 10-year treasury that would be the mother of all credit events which is precisely why i think we've seen in recent weeks the bank of japan come in and intervene why we've seen yellen start talking about currency moves getting too extreme then okay we can do something about it ultimately 91% treasury yields forget 910 657 puts the us into a debt spiral puts the word world into a debt spiral and and the what that credit event left to its own devices no intervention just the math is dollar up yields up stocks down receipts down economy down issuance up treasury issuance up yields up dollar up wash rance repeats until basic basally most assets go no bid and the dollar goes to some really big number uh and when i say no bid s&p tiny number um that's how that would go left to its own device is no interference but that gives you a sense of the stakes of how the policy makers are are are going to intervene in my view to prevent that and ultimately the way you prevent that is a steadily weaker dollar so we've seen some dollar weakness since the uh the bank of japan interventions a couple weeks ago we'll see if it continues you know that they right when the yend was threatening to get disorderly in terms of the weakness that's where that came in i think you will continue to see uh key levels on currencies defended aggressively against the dollar by with with the fed and treasury's blessing because of the stakes i just laid out final question from kl my question is what are your three top unknowns for precious medals and hard recession going forward uh for me again hard recession is is on a real basis it's not nominal i don't think we're going to get an ' 08 an 01 a 91 because to get that with debt deficits and net international investment position where it is requires the us government to stand aside and let a debt spiral kick off that defunds every western sovereign including ultimately itself it makes uh it it it makes no sense um and i don't think it's going to be allowed to happen politically uh on a real basis you look we get we get some sort of effective yield curve control at four and inflation at eight there's a recession your money is declining re a lot in value that the amount your money buys is shrinking that's a def a recession on a real basis um but i don't think it's going to happen in nominal terms could happen in gold terms could happen in bitcoin terms i think it's been happening um in terms of productivities in terms of known unknowns for the precious metals productivity miracle uh we get some sort of nuclear fusion or uh ai that's very energy efficient and uh basically if that happens you really don't need gold or bitcoin um you don't need the neutral reserve asset that preserves your purchasing power and energy terms energy is basically free if energyy is free for everybody the debts all going to be made at whole on a real basis you want to own equities you want to own other assets but i don't think that's very likely to happen but that's sort of spitballing about what that could poss possibly look like so with that i'm going to wrap it up for today thank you as always for joining me if you like these updates check out tree rings fft t- lc.com 10 most

[music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke growman fftt hope you are well well and having a great week i know i am uh cavs are up two games to nothing in the first round of the nba playoffs always a a good thing when the cleveland sports teams win we i don't think we've gotten our fair share of that over over my lifetime certainly so with that we're going to jump right in thank you as always for the questions very helpful helps uh uh thought process uh and uh i just find it very uh interesting and helpful uh and so thank you so uh first question from ab my question is can you list the primary ways the us government would likely delay or avoid the effects of the debt doom loop can they delay the effects indefinitely yeah they can they can absolutely uh delay the effects indefinitely the number one release valve is the dollar uh the lower the dollar goes the lower rates go um the less uh of a debt problem there is um and so that that's number one it's really important important to understand that us fiscal dominance is not a permanent condition yet it's a function of the level of the dollar the dollar goes up the us goes into fiscal dominance very fast dollar goes down us gets out of fiscal dominance we've seen this in the last uh three times in the last two years uh we saw the us deficit uh coming out of co over $3 trillion we get an everything bubble in 2021 early 2022 we get booming tax receipts by the end of fiscal 2022 the us deficit has gone from over 3 trillion to about 1.1 trillion just in an everything bubble flip side fed raises rates in 22 stocks go down bonds go down we get tax receipts in 23 that are disappointing fiscal 23 the deficit doubles in a year with unemployment really not moving what was the release valve week dollar everything bubble receipts up inflation up and deficits go way way down which means issuance of treasuries goes way way down means global growth goes up means global balance sheet to buy a reduced amount of treasuries goes up treasury market stabilizes you get the dollar down you get inflation up you get rates down there is no fiscal problem flip side 2022 into 2023 dollar up rates up stocks down receipts down issuance up global balance sheet down to buy increased amount of treasuries oops treasury market dysfunction again twice in 2023 1 q23 3 q23 both times met with more dollar liquidity from fed and/or treasury so that's number one so there's there's there's an easy way out of it you you give me the dollar the dxy at 90 85 there's going to be a debt spiral um the release val will be the currency u other ways not involving the currency uh sure number one uh the biggest as we keep saying is productivity miracle u and that can take a lot of shapes that can be a happy productivity miracle or a not so happy productivity miracle and depending on where you are um look if if russia and china have some sort of political uh changes at the top um more us friendly governments take over they begin funding us deficits again by buying large amounts of treasuries pricing oil only in dollars uh it's great for the treasury market it's great for washington dc it's great for wall street uh it's probably going to be terrible for the us middle and working classes finishing uh finish the job and apply the cuda gra hollowing them out um and it's probably be terrible for the world basically it's going to be great for the you know the sort of the those at the very very top and and pretty much nobody else um but that could prevent a do that doom loop um the next way productivity miracle right now this year the us government will spend about $3.3 trillion uh in social security and health and human services outlays medicare medicaid social security that 3.3 trillion compares to 4.5 to 4.7 trillion in receipts uh so that's like 70% of receipts are getting paid to boomers uh who also happen to be uh the wealthiest generation in us history and maybe in human history uh and so if there was something that happened that uh uh over the next couple years enough boomers pass on quickly that um it cuts 1 to two trillion per year in social security and health and human services medicare medicaid spending out um that's going to buy you a lot of time that's 1 to two trillion a year less in deficits um and uh boomers also have about 70 5 trillion give or takeen wealth that if they passed on some portion of it would flow to their kids who were in peak spending years so they'd be good for growth uh and the tax man would get his cut so deficits would go down even further so again i didn't see all these productivity miracles were happy miracles all i'm saying is i'm as an objective analyst you're asking for how it could happen it's how it could happen too that's not a pleasant way but it could happen uh small modular nuclear reactors rolled out on a manhattan project uh scale speed uh fusion rolled out on that same scale both of those seem like hail marri's at the moment based on what i'm seeing uh ai could certainly be a productivity miracle but a it has to be rolled out fast enough that it is deflationary but not so fast that it's too deflationary because if ai comes out too fast and creates 10% unemployment 5% more unemployment um that's that's that's going to create a lot more issuance and domestic political destabilization of which we're already seeing enough already if you look around so um you add some unemployment driven by ai on top of that a reduction in tax receipts an increase in counter cyclical welfare payments with higher unemployment um that that that that can be destabilizing destabilizing as well so those are some ways that it could happen i'm not rooting for or calling for any of them i'm simply uh identifying different potential uh paths if you will next question from ns why is this time truly different we've been hearing about the us's fiscal wos for over half a century yet international buying of us debt is at an all-time high deepening the euro dollar gordian kn why should we believe now is different uh i don't think it is different and i don't think you should believe it's different um uh ns showed in in in the question in a 1972 time magazine cover asking quote is the us broke showing uncle sam holding his pockets outturn with with nothing in them and it was an article highlighted by uh my friend jack farley and mark da on a recent conversation on on jack farley's podcast uh both of them failed to mention what happened in markets from 1972 to 1980 that allowed the us to avoid going quote unquote broke uh so let's list how did the us avoid that last time is it different this time so from 1972 to 1980 the dxy index went from 110 to 80 peak or peak the trough ultimately uh it went from 110 to 90 within 18 months of that article that cover appearing uh cpi after that magazine cover appeared cpi year-over year in the united states was never below 5% from 1972 to 1980 ever again uh in that entire 8 to n year period even though there was a recession in there cpi never went below five okay us nominal gdp growth from 1972 to 1980 consistently 300 to 600 basis points above the nominal yield on long-term us treasuries in other words for8 to nine years us treasuries at the long end were certificates of confiscation they were trash on a real basis um even during the 1973 74 recession there's this view oh long bonds going be a great great to own if we ever go into recession we had a recession 7374 they it bonds yields came down but they didn't collapse and they remained well below the yield on uh nominal gdp growth because inflation was so high they you still lost money on a real basis in bonds in a recession the very next year after that magazine cover appeared okay what else what else happened 72 to 80 gold rose 16 times in eight years so my point in all this is it's not different this time the us is not going to go broke not nominally broke it's going to inflate we do whatever it has to do to avoid it people saying inflation's transitory uh or hey by the long end are the ones that are saying it's different this time now what is different what is different this time is debt to gdp now is 120% it was only 35% when that magazine cover ran in 1972 uh us deficit the gdp it's 7% now not 2% like it was when that cover ran in 1972 uh the the the market value of us official gold as a percentage of total foreign debt outstanding it was 25% when that magazine cover ran basically that's the amount that's the percentage the market value of us official gold is collateralizing us foreign debt 25% in may 1972 on its way to 135% by late 1979 early 1980 you know where it is today 7 7% gold would have to rise nearly 4x just to get to back to where we were in may 1972 it' have to rise 20x nearly to get back to where we were in 1979 it's way worse this time and again it's not going to be different than how it worked out governments don't go broke nominally what they do is they inflate and they crush the real value of bonds they crush bond holders on a real basis and so most people still oh it's going to be i'm not saying it be different this time i'm going to say it's being the same it's just going to be a little worse because there the debts are higher the deficits are higher lower starting position in terms of uh where gold and some of these inflation hedges are but most us investors we highlighted this from vincent delard last week last three years most investors are still moving money into long bonds they've not put any money into gold they've actually pulled money out of gold in the us so most investors in the us still don't own gold they still don't own bitcoin in any real way if at all they still have a lot of exposure to long bonds and i'm just saying it's not going to be different this time i mean entitlements were cash flow positive in 1972 we were four years in to medicare medicaid now they've been negative cash flow negative for 10 years 13 years so that's the uh um that's that's my point it's not different this time people saying inflation is going to be transitory or the people saying it's going to be different this time good luck all right from gm would love to hear your suggestions on the sustainability of medium-sized businesses through the possible tough times ahead uh in my opinion it depends on the business i think it's going to depend on management i think it's going to depend on debt levels uh on the business uh asset intensity of the business uh margins of the business business and and you know i think there's going to be some modicum of bumpy times ahead they could take a number of different way shape and form uh likely with a heavy uh political aspect to them in terms of how they uh uh develop from here uh perfect example you're a us manufacturer and we have a world war like that's terrible we the world world war is terrible if you're a us manufacturer it's going to be great great you're going to boom um if you're a us manufacturer and we have a new great depression somehow it's that's terrible so some of it is is an aspect of something i always say which is is what's normal for the spider is chaos for the fly you know so don't be a fly so you could run through that site type of dichotomy for a lot of different businesses um in my opinion there's a few things that probably uh without being specific about a type business or or situation that i think are probably good rules of thumb if i was owner of or a manager of a mediumsized business knowing what i think i know could happen uh in terms of a range of outcomes over the next two to five years i want low debt i want high working capital levels or high cash i don't want it i want to stay liquid right so when i say working capital cash high cash levels i want to keep my inventory working capital low uh cash high right uh keep inventory turns high uh i want to stay low over my skis just broadly speaking so um long if i if i'm if i'm managing or owning a long capital cycle business where i need to really make a big investment and with a long payback period i would build very large margins of errors into my internal rate of return or or net present value calculations before before i approved any projects and certainly before i took on debt for any of those projects so that's how i would approach it without more specifics it's tough to say more than that but those are some rules of thumb that i think um are pretty timeless given like i said what i what i think i know in terms of the potential paths over the next several years now from jl you talk a lot about inflating away our debt and dollar going away from reserve currency status could you paint a picture of what that scenario looks like for the average average american i love listening to you and lynn but have a hard time tracking your conversations about potential scenarios for the next two to 10 years and seeing the ramifications for the average middle working class person u so first a point of clarification i don't think the dollar is going to lose its global reserve currency status uh i do think we are well into as in a decade into a shift back where the dollar remains global reserve currency uh but gold is resuming its role as global reserve asset from the treasury bond which had been the primary global reserve asset for most of the prior 40 50 years uh these this is a vast oversimplification so take it with a grain of salt in my opinion the impact would be something in the direction of the average working and middle class american would see when you talk about inflating away or yield curve control or financial oppression i think the average middle and workingclass americans would see goods an energy inflation of 10 to 20% kager compound annual growth uh for some span of 2 to 5 years i think they would see wage inflation of 8 to 10% keger for that same two to five years uh in theory on their on an operating basis they're behind if they have a fixed rate 30-year or 15year mortgage though uh that rate is not going to reset and so what ends up happening relative to their wages as they get a debt jubilee on their house um you know if you have a 3% inflation uh and then you tax affect it and you're getting 8 to 10% ker wage increases uh your your mortgage is declining every year on a real basis even as your living costs are rising every year on a real basis a little bit you know more than your wages uh i think your i i think your financialized assets like bonds in particular fixed rate assets i think they get crushed on a real basis in that environment um and that's what the us government needs like that's how you deliver that's how governments always deliver that's how they quote unquote go broke that's what happen last time and again i don't think it's going to be different this time uh i think industrial and commodity businesses investments stocks do well uh i think wealth and income inequality in this country uh moderate i think you would see the uh the the uh the below 80% right whatever it is the the the 0 to 80th percentile of incomes and and um net worth would see higher wage and net worth growth than those in the top 10% and and certainly those in the top 5% so that's what that might look like you can take it a lot of different ways but that that gives some sense from ir if treasury holders have assurances of liquidity between treasuries and reserves what risk does duration really have uh purchasing power risk perfect example october 1973 oil is about 3 bucks april 1974 oil is about 12 bucks everybody got paid every got paid on their on their treasuries there's no risk you just went buying six months later you're buying 75% less oil you're with with that same thousand so i don't think that's going to happen to be clear however i do think we can i mean it's it's not i was just putting a chart together today in 1988 a treasury bond um a treasury bond bought you 75 barrels of oil less than 20 years later bought a lot less soil six seven barrels right so uh it depends on your holding period etc uh but ultimately uh i purchasing power risk is your risk uh from bv what's your take on 10year tips i sold all my bond funds a couple years ago except for a tips etf because of the inflation how are treasuries protected from inflation are the interest rates determined uh in my opinion having the tips is is if there's no other inflation hedged long duration asset i think better than nothing i personally prefer holding physical gold and self- custody bitcoin as inflation hedges um and i prefer short you know short end bonds for for my fixed income part of the portfolio which is small but that's um that that's what i prefer you know the formula for tips is is based on uh government calculated inflation rates um so they have an incentive to understate inflation given their debt load so like i said it's better than nothing but um i i prefer i prefer for the inflation currency debasement side of my portfolio bitcoin and gold um in in proper allocation sizes and then finally from dg if you believe that china has taken control of the gold price how does that impact another's view that at first gold and the dollar would go up together and then the paper gold pr paper gold price could crash as futures contracts become worthless due to the failure to deliver in cash settlement how do you see this endgame playing out so little bit of inside baseball background first another uh capital a another was an anonymous monetary blogger who wrote on some gold message boards back in the late 1990s into uh shortly before 911 uh with another partner of his foa which stood for friend of another um uh fofoa who has a a really good blog who's uh he was the one who introduce me to the thought process uh about 15 16 years ago um and so that is who dg means when he refers to another uh definitely has influenced my thinking um on monetary matters so to answer the question uh dollar and gold are going up together as we speak uh and have been really since 2014 when when global central banks stopped growing holdings of treasuries which is uh sort of like the the the start of of of the of of the wind down of the system um if i recall correctly another also i think he technically said all paper will burn quote unquote and so in my opinion that is somewhat an open to interpretation what does he mean by paper is it paper gold is it all sovereign debt is it all debt and what does he mean by burn is burn literally go to zero or is it on a real basis relative to physical gold um gold that that's it is in theory possible it's theoretically possible paper gold could fall to its inherent value which is zero right if you've got 100 paper ounces and one gold ounce underlying 100 paper ounces and someone claims that paper ounce or excuse me the physical ounce underpinning the 100 to1 levered paper ounces uh the other 99 paper ounces are are worth whatever the cash settlement is in a some sort of force measure situation to be clear i do not think that's how it's going to go i'm simply saying that is theoretically possible uh i do think if you read into the basil 3 uh regulation changes starting in around 2017 with the basel 3 reforms and the treatment of gold and how it changed u as a tier one asset under certain conditions um and then with the net stable funding ratios around gold for unallocated gold centered in london with some of the bullan banks to big def fail banks uh and and alistair mcla did some really good writing on that in 2021 which i would encourage you to read to my eyes there appears to be have been some levels of macr prudential preparation for the possibility that gold could go a lot higher in a relatively short period of time to make sure a gold spike didn't send the banking system into the abyss as uh bank of england governor eddie george said would happen if gold prices went too high back in 1999 uh one last thing i will leave you with a quote from another that i think plays into dg's question this is from february 1998 direct quote from another quote any nation state can put its economy currency on a gold standard they only have two requirements own a stockpile of gold and raise the price very high in the past when currencies were gold and nation could not lower the amount of gold backing its currency raised the price of gold because it lowered the currency unit worldwide and created payment imbalances today no nation or currency is on a gold standard the first country that starts will own the rest for some time find me a country with many needed resources little debt in relation to its assets and a national pride to lead let them price gold at many thousands not only in their currency but also in their resources the world would buy from them cheaply in gold but dearly in all other unbacked currencies the markets would do the rest starts to sound like russia doesn't it the large modern currencies of today have only debt-ridden economies to back them they cannot change as debt blocks their path to change is to live and to live some debts must die the owners of much of this debt must lose if change is to occur even the new euro will not be backed by gold it will hold gold only as insurance against the worst outcome war yes an oil state comes to mind it could even be china interesting right that's 1998 at any rate that's where we're going to wrap up for today again as always thank you very much for joining me i really enjoy these discussions if you like them want more of this type of content check out fft tt- llc.com for more information about subscribing to our tree rings product 10 most interesting things what grabbed us about each one of them if it is either confirming uh a way we'd been thinking about the world or often changing a way we had previously been thinking about the world so with that i'm going to wrap it up thank you again for your time go cavaliers we'll talk to you soon take care everyone [music] [music]
Russia/China/US options for de-escalation and financial moves & more,2022-03-08 14:47:11+00:00,14,ohWO9qjaiw8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohWO9qjaiw8,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke growman fftt hope you are well and having a great week hope you enjoyed the uh eclipse yesterday i know here in cleveland we were pretty much the center of it all uh was really cool uh seeing the stars out in the middle of the day which is what happened in totality that's not something i've ever seen before so very very cool uh at any rate let me jump in thank you as always for the questions really enjoy these updates and uh putting together the thought process for them find it very helpful so thank you so first question is from pb hey luke it seems clear that massive chinese demand is driving gold prices higher but what could be the catalyst for this is it just real estate wo or is something worse happening in the chinese economy that is pushing investors to buy gold uh i'm hearing that chinese demand is concerns about uh real estate concerns about uh geopolitics a little bit of the economy on the margin um i think this means some really interesting things though that aren't being picked up up on in the mainstream financial media first off uh this means de facto that the the chinese capital account is open on a limited basis through gold uh they get panicked they're buying gold okay so far so good stay with me here now that means that the more of an issue there is in china economic geopolitical etc the more gold the chines are going to buy given their savings they have given the fact that the chinese are still running 30-year high manufacturing surpluses 30-year highs uh with the world which means their dollar inflows are at near 30-year highs so the more of an economic issue is there is the more of a geopolitical issue is the more gold is likely to be bought by chinese consumers that will all else equal drive gold up in you on terms now in a world where oil and commodities were still only priced in dollars that is where historically things would have gotten really sticky for china and now because as the yuan goes up in china due to chinese buying the us can control the price of gold as they've historically done when they've needed to in dollar terms and if you have the price of gold going up in yuan but not moving in dollars what you get is the yuan falling against the dollar okay so far so good falling youan against the dollar when oil and other commodities are only priced in dollars means that china's money is not going as far for their oil and commodity imports so now they need to run down dollar fx reserves to buy oil etc eventually on this path they run out of dollar reserve and then they have a southeast asia currency crisis like we saw in 1997 economic and currency uh bad outcome yuan collapses okay that's in a world where oil and commodities are still only priced in dollars but the marginal oil barrel and marginal commodity ton are priced in yuan now it doesn't take a lot it just takes the ability to do so why because now when the price of gold goes up in yuan with oil and commodities priced in yuan as well the marginal ton what that's saying is something very different that is saying that gold now buys more oil in china in yuan than it does in london in dollars in new york and what does that do capital flows where it's treated best gold is just capital so the gold starts to flow to china where it can buy more oil we would start to see london etf tonnage drained check we would start to see lbma tonnage drained check eventually as enough tonnage was drained we would start to see gold prices shift to being set in china instead of in london or new york as has always been the case over the last 50 to 60 years check hopefully you're now starting to see why you want oil and commodities is such a big deal people have not understood this in the six years it's been out you want oil and and commodities take a chinese balance of payments southeast asia currency crisis off the table it means that when china gets into trouble and they buy gold it ends up setting the price of gold up which in turn puts pressure after a while on the dollar which in turn puts upward pressure on us inflation expectations there's a loose correlation between gold prices and us inflation expectations if chinese buying of gold can affect the us dollar and us inflation expectations they can influence us rates which is fine when the us has sovereign de the gd gp of 20 30 50 60% like we did from 1979 through 200 2005 we're at 120% rising again so you have high levels of debt high levels of deficit and you have chinese buying of gold paired with yuan oil and commodities driving gold flows to china gold prices up which will eventually impact the dollar inflation expectations in dollars and as inflation expectations go up us rates which at some point as we saw last fall get problematic enforced dollar liquidity injections feeds back on the dollar so uh wash rinse repeat uh what it means is that yuan oil allows china to gain control of gold and allow physical demand for gold actually to drive the price of gold which has really never been the case up until about the last two years um so now is this bad for america no the best thing for america right now would be a much weaker dollar this is actually helping america paradoxically if the dollar falls as a result of this but some parties in america want this yelling biden uh others who recognize that the united states needs a much weaker dollar to compete but there's also a lot of people in america who think strong dollar is the be all end all it's the economic orthodoxy of the last 40 years and that makes for a dangerous geopolitical time both abroad and and uh it makes for uh tensions here domestically because there's two different views on how to handle this the one thing i will say is this calculus remains very poorly understood we can see that just look around at all these articles why is gold moving why is gold up why is gold not stopping where it stopped before why is it moving now you can find any number of articles over the last couple of months um the calculus i just described remains very very poorly understood i think it'll get more understood through the course of this year but i suspect gold's prices will be higher by then so that was a long one let's jump into a few others here real quick from btbf would' like to hear your thoughts on gold and bitcoin replacing treasuries as the global safe haven asset whether you agree disagree and what in your opinion will be the dominant safe haven asset in the next two plus years next two years roughly excuse me uh at the central bank level gold has replaced treasuries over the past 10 years in in terms of marginal flows full stop you can see it in a chart foreign official treasury demand is down 325 billion at market prices over the last 10 years gold uh central bank gold holdings are up $450 billion at market prices over the last 10 years uh it was dramatically accelerated that trend by russian us sanctions on russian fx reserves in 2022 i do think gold will continue to be the dominant marginal um uh central bank reserve asset going forward in terms of marginal flows um gold per the lengthy uh first uh point or question uh answer that we just uh talked about is clearly the safe haven in china and china is still the world's biggest creditor and the factory of the world so uh that suggests gold will continue to gain share globally in terms of as a safe haven asset and marginal flows and again once gold gets high enough it should start to negatively impact the dollar which would be great for us growth us economy us asset prices global growth it will actually stabilize the treasury market as us tax receipts increase us deficits fall up it's just a little bit higher inflation it is what it is that's that's in the cake at this point so those are those are my thoughts from sh markets see a higher neutral rate at the moment than the fed does could you provide your thoughts on what that means for asset markets if that ends up being true and similarly vl would like your views on jamie diamond's takes regarding 8% rates incoming i am finding that traditional wall street is having a hard time coming to grips with the reality that the us fiscal situation is not able to afford higher rates unless the dollar is lowered significantly from here in other words the dollar is at 104 where we are today us can't afford much higher rates if the dollar's at 107 it needs lower rates the dollar's at 114 katie bar the door we saw that two years ago fall of 22 uh it needs even lower rates similarly if the dollar versus 104 today is at 100 could take probably a little bit higher rates if the dollar's at 90 take lower rates still if the dollar's at 80 or 70 or 60 could the us weather this 8% rates that jamie diamond's talking about yeah they probably could they probably could so that's what i i think it's important to understand there's multiple levers here uh it's not just where are the rates where are the rates where's the dollar the dollar is low enough we can afford the rates if the dollar is too high we can't and what is too high a dollar level is declining over time as the debt levels increase um and so uh i also think that it remains poorly understood although it's getting better understood a point we've been making for about a year now that higher rates with debt the gdp this high is actually inflationary on a lag um and so again this dynamic of let's just raise rates and kind of stamp out the looser private financial conditions that is in reference to a world that does not exist anymore and will not exist again until federal debt the gdp is back to probably 70% and that's going to require negative real rates sustained high inflation uh and and interest rates below the rate of inflation so um and that's kind of what i'm talking about here right like like if if if inflation's 12 and our rates are eight great that works um if if inflation's two and our rates are eight not with the debt we have that's a disaster so that's really the key in terms of looking at this next question from ab give us your thoughts on real estate i see a lot of real estate haters yet real estate with fixed rate debt should greatly outperform in an inflationary environment just ask someone in an emerging market this seems under discust um i think it depends on location i think it depends on the assets in question and i think it depends on the rates of inflation so let me get a little bit more detailed in each of those location i think that's pretty well understood in in real estate right location location location all right so we won't spend a lot of time there asset uh if you're talking about strip malls in or commercial real estate i think some of these assets are probably secularly impaired given fundamental changes in the way our economy work postco particularly in areas of the country where you're seeing population declines as a result of uh movement or or aging slight elev slight and in terms of inflation is it good yes up to a point particularly relative to your interest rate so if you've got a 30-year fixed rental house and it's a low rate and inflation picks up that's that's good for you clearly once you get too high of inflation though and i don't know what that rate is i'm simply communicating what was communicated to me by an executive with a company from an emerging market a couple of lifetimes ago probably about 20 years ago um at a meeting uh intuitively it makes sense once inflation gets too high banks stop making long duration loans um then either the government does it or nobody does and if nobody does then asset values in real estate start collapsing toward cash um why and the reason is pretty intuitive and again i never really thought about it is americ until someone from emerging market explained it to me which was if inflation's 20 no banks are making 5% mortgage loans 7% mortgage loans 10% mortgage loans it just doesn't they need to make mortgage loans on a real basis so they they start to give inflation gets too high and i don't know that 20 is the right number maybe the right number is 100 uh or 50 or something like that right so um i don't know what that number is that's why i say at some point it gets too high and the banks pull in duration because you simply can't make a long duration loan once inflation is too high and when that happens assets whose prices are dependent upon debt-based leverage financing like real estate is the prices based on leverage collapse with the leverage fall toward cash values which tends to be down so extreme example probably not going to happen here but i wanted to throw it out as something that i learned about once a upon a time i think it's interesting i think it's something to think about and be aware of uh but generally speaking i think your instincts are correct about in terms of the right piece of property and the right location um right financing cash flow positive in a modest inflation world i think it makes sense as a hard asset to own uh and then the final question luke if you factor in from jg luke if you factor in mandatory spending social security medicare medic pa debt payment military does this put us in a $2 trillion deficit before the lights are even turned on um here too that depends on tax receipts and tax receipts depend on asset prices heavily in terms of the marginal as we've highlighted multiple times and 2023 proved uh and that's heavily dependent on stock prices and all of asset and stock prices are heavily dependent on the level of the dollar higher dollar is worse for stocks and receipts and deficits and lower dollar is better for stocks and receipts and deficits so uh let's add up the math where are we today entitlements are roughly going to be about $3.3 trillion in outlay social security medicare medicaid u the health and human services broadly uh about $3.3 trillion this year military $900 billion this year roughly uh that does not include about 300 billion of veterans affairs um within that we set that aside um bank of america said interest expense this year on a gross basis will near $1.6 trillion by the end of this year uh so if you uh add 3.3 trillion plus 900 billion is 4.2 trillion plus 1.6 trillion is $5.8 trillion by way of comparison receipts last year if i recall correctly were around 4.4 trillions so uh we're not at 2.2 we're not at $2 trillion for those necessities before we turn the lights on we're at 1.4 trillion before we turn the lights on yay um however to my prior point if the dollar goes down stocks go up inflation go up receipts go up that $ 1.4 trillion number goes down we saw that from 2020 to 2021 when the deficit went from 3.1 trillion to 1.2 trillion with the everything bubble flip side the dollar goes up we saw this 2022 to 2023 we went from 1.2 to 2.1 trillion in a single year dollar up stocks down receipts down issuance up deficit up so that's there there there are levers and i think what's critical is they know the levers now they us policy makers in washington they saw 20 20 to 21 and we saw most importantly 2023 last fall washington post new york times wall street journal these newspapers of record amongst the washington and wall street beltway saying oh my gosh how did what happened to receipts what h what happened to the deficit it blew out and they all looked into it it was like oh it was interest and it was asset prices falling the impact of on receipts from asset prices falling flowing through into consumer spending gdp and receipts so they know they need stocks up to get receipts up and so receipts this year actually probably pretty good um i think i think that buys some time to the situation we'll know here in another few weeks but at any rate that's going to be it for today as always thank you for joining me if you like these updates check out fft tt- llc.com for

[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke growman fft hope you are well thank you for joining me today appreciate everybody submitting the questions uh very helpful really always look forward to these sessions uh before i start off just really quickly wanted to highlight this week we have a tree rings promotion you get uh four free weeks if you sign up this week so check out that at our website now we're going to jump into the questions uh first question from np luke what are some major macro geopolitical events that are making you rethink or reanalyze your held positions from two years back i would guess how the eu has reacted geopolitically since co would be one uh yes the eu has very much surprised me with their self-destructive actions regarding energy policy uh and how that is leading to a resulting de-industrialization of europe in favor of the us uh i don't know why the eu reacted the way they did but they did that surprised me i the other rethink i would highlight that i am still in pretty early days of in other words this is very loosely held however uh i have long thought last three four five years uh that the us could had a choice it could either win the great power competition against china or it could maintain the real value of the us treasury market i.e we needed to significantly weaken the dollar via a fed financed or us banking system financed uh industrial policy uh to win the great power competition but the offshoot would be higher inflation weaker dollar i thought that was a choice uh i'm increasingly as a result of recent events thinking that there's a real chance we both lose the great power competition to china and lose the real value of the us treasury market there have been a number of things that have had me shading in that direction but in the last couple of weeks we have seen uh the first it was intel in february here in my home state of ohio saying we're delaying the the fab in columbus ohio till at least late 26 early 27 we can't find the labor is what i'm hearing the problem is uh more recently in just the last couple of weeks samsung sk lg major korean players in in tech out saying they are suspending the the the the the uh building of factories cited as as sort of victories in the reshoring battle and noting that the costs in arizona which is a us right to work state in theory this is one of the cheaper states uh very close to the mexican border right to work which means it's non-union uh they're saying that construction costs in arizona are 4 to 5x what they are in asia uh that echoes what josh wolf testified to congress last fall where he noted that it costs the us six times more to build a gwatt of nuclear power plant capacity than it does for china and capitalism 101 says if it costs you four to five to 6x more to build something you're going to lose full stop that's it so these dynamics plus other ones i have have heard or seen firsthand plus what i am seeing firsthand in the rust belt which is our skilled trades as a rule are getting quite old which is what you get when you spend 40 years de-industrializing your economy like the united states has and so there's a real skills gap in terms of the skilled labor needed to win the great power competition when you factor in also what seems to be lackluster execution on that front from the us government and that's not a political statement that's both trump biden democrat republican i don't care the execution has been suboptimal i'm starting to be concerned that it what i had long thought was an or we win the great power competition or we keep the real value of the treasury market is now at risk increasing risk of becoming an and um we lose it the great power competition and we lose the real value of the treasury market macro implication sustains secular inflation own gold own bitcoin it'd be great for industrial equities etc uh okay second question jt where are you at with central banks revaluing gold to leverage a lower debt to gdp uh perfect tie into the first question or first response which is the more likely it becomes that the united states loses the great power competition and is at risk of losing the real value of the treasury market the more likely the gold revaluation outcome becomes in my view and as a as a as a reminder uh treasury can instruct fed to revalue remonetized gold the action of doing so given 261 million ounces of us official gold every $4,000 per ounce time 261 million ounces is roughly a trillion dollars that would get deposited into the united states treasury general account free and clear with which yellen can do whatever she wants so $44,000 per ounce is a trillion 5 trillion would be enough to take us debt to gdp from 122% to about 70 to 80% virtually overnight just by waiting in and buying back uh treasuries overnight in the open market uh so then we go okay 4,000 per ounce we need 5 trillion 4,000 is 1 trillion 4,000 * 5 is $20,000 per ounce into that deposits 5 trillion into the tga 5 trillion can get deposited buyback treasuries overnight without affecting the market uh because it's going to deposit cash into those accounts voila that the gdp 70 80% now the fed can really be independent of treasury again no more fiscal dominance and uh a way we go we can we can start to uh reinvest and run up uh rerun up our debt the gdp it be inflationary but inflation's at the cake at this point unless we're willing to really let a great depression take hold uh next question from john talk about tax options in the us available to attempt to address revenue shortfalls in your main thesis of permanent deficits relative to pure countries there seems to be some room to move up as you can see in this article from the wall street journal attached uh that john attached so uh i would highlight something that stan dren miller said in conversation to cural sakoff last year uh around may it was a publicly available interview you can find it online i think it's in youtube here's stan duck and miller quote i learned something when i was preparing the speech for usc because i knew we were in bad shape economists have something they call the fiscal gap that's the amount you would have to raise taxes today to maintain the generosity that you've promised future seniors and in the united states that's 7.7% of gdp what does that mean that means if you wanted to fix the situation today without touching entitlements you'd have to raise taxes 40% tomorrow 40 40 tomorrow morning and keep them there forever and or cut spending tomorrow morning by 35% and keep them there forever although of course it's worse than that because that would cause the economy to go down and actually tax revenues to go down blah blah blah what was astonishing to me is our fiscal gap is 7.7% france france the poster child for social welfare and all that stuff their fiscal gap is 2.4% so it's less than a third of ours and they're addressing the problem it's frankly amazing again this is stan dren miller most legendary investor of all time in my opinion so back to back to me onetime wealth tax where us comes out and says every account over $100 million or combination of accounts over 100 million dollar uh gets 30% taken out of it something like that could work that i think would have severe legal and domestic political implications but that's a problem when you get record wealth inequality you're going to have the people to control the political system aren't going to like it but the majority the vast majority of people will say hey that makes perfect sense uh maybe a national sales tax could do it everybody pays 2% more on everything they buy uh x say food and gasoline um again that could work but it also it risks reducing consumption anything that reduces consumption in a economy that is 65 to 70% consumption with debt to gdp as high as it is and deficits as high as they are runs the risk of triggering a deleveraging where you end up with deficits higher as a percent of gdp not lower we saw this in 20145 with obamacare wall street journal in 2014 december came out and said hey obamacare is going to reduce the deficit by pushing healthc care costs the government's paying now onto consumers it's basically a tax increase great by second quarter of 2016 us deficit the gdp was higher than it was when obamacare was passed why well when you make people pay more for healthcare they were getting basically for free they buy fewer cars they buy fewer you know meals out they go on fewer vacations the the consumption of everything else gets crowded out economy slows in a high leverage economy and oh by the way debt now is way higher than it was then postco uh you end up worse off than you otherwise would have been so uh i'm not very optimistic that we can tax hike our way out of it but we'll see the national sales tax uh maybe particularly if it was income tested or means tested uh and then the final question hi luk could you take us through the mechanics of how positive real rates leads to treasury market this function uh sure so positive real rates just means your rates are above inflation uh without significant productivity growth at 122% debt to gdp that means your debt grows faster than income balance sheet glob gl to buy the debt uh crowds out the global dollar markets and so the dollar starts to go up as the dollar goes up foreigners who have $13 trillion in dollar denominated debt have a harder time servicing their debt right their their dollar debt grows as a percent of their income describes globally what i was just describing a second ago what do they do well it turns out because they've been running surpluses against the united states for the last 50 years they also owns 7.6 trillion in treasury bonds along with another 11 12 trillion net of u equities and other other assets so if they need dollars to service their own debt and have 7.6 trillion of treasuries lying around guess what they do they sell treasuries to raise dollars to address their own debt strains caused by the rising dollar so the dollar going up not just slows the economy as dollar debt gets more onerous globally uh but it adds to the amount of net treasury supplies because now with a glo slowing global economy you're going to have slowing us economy slowing us economy you're going to have rates or excuse me you're going to have deficits rising as deficits rise uh you're going to have more treasury issuance that's going to send the dollar up as the dollar goes up foreigners join treasury and fed selling treasuries so now your net treasury supplies grows nonlinearly which sends the dollar up faster wash rinse repeat until either fedt treasury or both step in weaken the dollar provide more dollar liquidity to support the treasury market or fed treasury stand aside and let treasury dysfunction turn into failed treasury auctions and then we start to go into a very severe deflationary outcome shortly thereafter i don't think they will ever let a treasury auction fail and year you know year to date life to date in the last four years we've had five instances of severe treasury dysfunction treasury market dysfunction and we are five for five with dollar liquidity being supplied very rapidly and that continues as a result to be our working hypothesis uh that the dollar liquidity will continue to be supplied every time uh the treasury market begins to dysfunction so with that thank you for joining me again this week we have a special on tree rings for free weeks check us out fft tt- llc.com for more information about that tree rings product and the offer we have for this week if you like these 10 updates you'll love tre rings it is

"Thoughts on rate hikes, Can the US let inflation run hot? Implications of oil pricing outside USD",2022-02-08 16:20:43+00:00,20,MS5ZyRBmhsc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS5ZyRBmhsc,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke growman fft hope you are well and have having a great week we're off to a great start here in lovely cleveland another nice week of weather here up in the 60s not a cloud in the sky which is how we like it on march 11th here it's uh it's unusual so we will take it so i'm going to jump right in here uh the first question from cr regarding got to get the dollar down is that why the bank of japan is ending yield curve control their rates go up stronger yen weaker dollar corollary how can they afford that without selling treasuries which then drives treasury rates up and then the dollar up uh great questions um in my opinion i think it may be part of a cordinated global effort to manage to a weaker dollar because a weaker dollar is in the interest of everyone in the world including the united states everybody desperately needs it uh great question about how can you do it without selling treasuries i don't think you can do it without selling treasuries with that said it would suggest in my opinion that you need a price insensitive buyer on the other side so fed qe or alternatively uh if you exempted treasuries from the bank slr as is now being discussed again or or asked for at least from isda last week um now all of a sudden you've got a huge buyer infinite buyer with a zero cost of capital in the banks and that should be effectively qe they should be a very price and sensitive buyer so is that all related i don't know but the pieces fit together so let's watch and see how it plays out uh from cp thoughts on impact to banking system as btfp rolls off and reverse repo is depleted uh reverse repo i think will continue to be drawn down uh supplying liquidity to the system after that you've got the tga treasury general account that can be run down my guess is that probably gets you pretty close to the election uh in terms of um deficits that need to be financed relative to the pool of capital there to finance them when you when you total up rootes left in rrp and and the tga and then i think that's where you can really get to the weaker dollar uh side of things if you weaken the dollar on a linear basis through the course of this year it should have a lagged impact that should help liquidity uh once those two pools of capital uh run out if you will or get get down to sort of uh tag ends uh failing that if they don't do that if the dollar gets stronger um i think it would probably be uh btfp going away and then rrp going away is probably riskof dollar up riskof dollar up gets us right back to that nasty third quarter 23 uh investing uh regime of dollar up gold up a little and everything else down uh from bt why would anyone buy gold bitcoin now rather than wait for a recession which appears to be imminent uh i disagree a recession appears imminent i don't think it is um i think in fiscal dominance where we are i think nominal gdp will continue to be good even if it's uh heavily government uh deficit driven um for sake of argument let's say that a recession does happen uh in theory i think you could get a a a brief selloff in gold and bitcoin into that but i would buy that with both hands because i don't think it would last i nei dip would last for very long at all uh i think markets are understanding increasingly uh in my opinion that recession means dollar up dollar up means treasury dysfunction in very short order um and policy makers have shown five times since fall of 2019 they will not abide treasury dysfunction for very long at all so uh with that lens to me trying to time and wait to buy gold and bitcoin ahead of a recession to me is is is probably uh at risk of being too cute uh i think most would not be able to execute that very well so i continue to add to uh golden bitcoin on on sort of any kind of day-to-day weakness um you know small ad additions they good siiz positions already but on weakness we we add to it from m is there anyone in the us government that sees the rest of the world might rug pull the world financial system on critical materials asking only gold for payment at x amount of dollars far higher than the current spot price of gold if so who would do this and is this not is it is is this not an unspoken act of war uh i think the us has known for a number of years particularly dod uh about uh the tenuous supply situation and certain critical raw materials and have been taking steps to hedge that i suspect uh i do think a move like that by a foreign power would be considered an act of war uh and cause for war and as such i don't think it's in anybody's interest to do that uh why would you do that and make yourself the overt bad guy when you can sit back and let compounding interest do what it's going to do do what it is doing to the us budget and then congress biden and trump uh congress biden or trump uh are the bad guys so that's if i was playing the other side's hand if you want to red team it that's how i would red team it that's how i would play just sit back and don't take the bait and let compounding interest do what it's going to do with that said take that with a grain of salt as i thought that's what putin would do in 2022 and i was dead wrong so um he invaded ukraine i didn't think he would because uh for some of those same reasons so take it with a grain of salt uh from lrg is the gold price being moved by the physical market not the paper market since us etfs continue to decline while the gold price rises if the physical market is now the main driver of the gold price does this mean that the east now has pricing control over gold uh in short yes in my opinion um yan nois wrote a great piece back in august of last year showing a breakdown across a number of different correlations and flows suggesting that the west had lost control of the gold price um that's publicly available you can find that online on gainesville coins website uh i think the key for why this is happening is that oil excuse me gold is rebe becoming an oil currency something we've been talking about with clients for a number of weeks now uh via the net settlement of bricks trade im balances really it's been for a number of months with for client with clients uh but it's for the net settlement of bricks trade imbalances so uh bricks trade amongst each other uh country to country in local currency they settle in goods and anything left over gets settled in gold at the central bank level at a floating price in all currency a lot of the imbalance is driven by energy and commodities and so ultimately what you have is gold being remade a uh energy currency a a oil settlement currency commodity settlement currency uh amongst the bricks now where it gets interesting is at this point point bricks oil demand is pretty much inexorable a lot of oil demand today tomorrow a lot of oil demand the next day lot of oil demand the day after that lot of oil demand uh china's the biggest oil importer in the world um and that's before you get to india whose demand is rising rapidly um so on and so forth so uh their demand for oil is an exorable the supplies of gold physical in the west are not inexorable so in my opinion we're in the early days of seeing price be the release valve and i think it will continue over time uh as gold is in by all appearances has been remade an oil currency by the bricks uh sd silver has really lagged gold during the recent gold rally historically many have treated gold and silver prices as tethered i wonder what your thoughts are on silver whether it is indeed fundamentally tethered and if buying silver makes sense as an undervalued mini gold uh in my opinion i think gold will continue to outperform silver as well as outperforming all commodities oil uh you know the goldman commodity index all of them uh gold being remade an energy currency means that gold is effectively uh being used as a settlement asset uh gold is not used for anything as is as we're all frequently reminded uh but during these points in the long cycle that's a good thing because it means you can inflate gold's price as much as you want and you're not hurting the real economy if you settled with let's say oil and oil you stored oil and you settled in it and the offset debt with it and the price of oil went to 400 barrels $400 a barrel to to serve the role as a settlement asset if oil is at $400 a barrel the global econ economy is collapsing people are billions of people are starving to death that's not good similarly if you use say corn to settle trade corn prices go from i don't even know where they are right now uh five six bucks they go to $25 half of the world starves in the next three months not nice same thought here with silver central banks have gold on their balance sheet they don't have silver on their balance sheet silver yes there is a mon ar aspect to it and i do like silver i own a little silver uh i think the fundamental outlook for silver continues to be good as we uh transition towards more electrification of societies around the world with that said if silver was being was serving as a neutral reserve asset its price would need to go much much higher and suddenly everywhere silver is would start to get very uneconomic iphones solar panels uh other electrical applications etc etc and that's why i think ultimately uh silver is different than gold i think when i think gold will continue to rise relative to silver relative to all commodities uh as it rebe becomes an oil currency next question from bd do you think the wall between treasury the fed uh excuse me the treasury and the fed is pretty much gone and because of that they have more creative creativity in dealing with the fiscal situation now uh this yes i do i do think the the whatever thin veneer of independence existed i think that has been that is gone and it will continue to be gone uh until uh the fiscal situation has de escalated and probably till the geopolitical situation has deescalate as well from sl how do possible hope not probable events like world war ii us civil war no 2024 us elction andor global cyber attack of impact your view on global macro and investment positions or allocation uh in my opinion most if not all of these things are are basically uninvestable they are in my view more of a a personal uh lifestyle decision or choice there's a great book uh 1 second after by william forston uh it's a really good read sobering read but good read in terms of thinking about this in my view uh the punchline is that without moderate amenities most people don't survive a year um and when i mean most i mean most uh more than 50% depending on where you are and in the book up in the upper midwest where i am the rates were about half in florida they were like 10% so um that's why i think it's much more personal for it's a great example of why it's a personal lifestyle choice uh hedging these risks also in my view isn't really a financial issue so it's it's where you live um fitness it's a huge issue for fitness uh how's how is one's fitness and other words can you go 6 months with no prescription meds and live if you can't i wouldn't worry about your money for any of those cases you're not going to make it anyway is to to be blunt as as harsh as that is so it's it's get the fitness um and then it is thinking about things like foron highlights in his book what is the carrying capacity of the land naturally where you live relative to that population uh over the last 40 50 years a quorum of americans have moved from places with very high carrying capacities relatively speaking to deserts semi deserts and swamps and that's fine as long as everything is fine and if it's not fine then that is a decision that uh would have to be factored into that as you think about macro and and your own personal life choices so from a macro perspective i don't think a lot about it uh i think it's you know i think it's uninvestable from that standpoint but i am an eagle scout so i i i always advise to be prepared and final question from ah any advice for a millennial trying to navigate the decision of liquidating inflation hedged assets recommended by fftt gold gold miners bitcoin etc to purchase a home uh i think it depends on your reason for it uh the i i the most important decision in life i have found has been who you choose to be your partner in life uh whatever that looks like for you um super super important then i think the next thing after that is if you have children with your partner uh educating them well and then being able to feed them high quality food are sort of right next on the on the list in terms of importance and so that's my personal al hierarchy and given that personal hierarchy in my view it is never a bad idea to sell assets such as we talked about to buy a modest home with a great partner in a great area and neighborhood with great schools and access to high quality food to feed uh children uh and educate your children my point my opinion that's the whole point of life like if if like why are we doing this otherwise now if you're selling these risk these assets to you know buy a giant mansion and and a lambo i would say don't to be blunt but i think so it really comes down again to a i think a personal decision and what what the goals are uh but for these major life milestones i don't think it's ever a bad idea uh to uh to make an investment in yourself and your partner and your children so with that i'm going to finish up for today thank you for joining me as always i always really enjoy these uh these conversations and updates so thanks for submitting your questions if you like these updates check us out fft tt- llc.com for more information

"Why oil rising is typically good for gold, why BTC is trading with tech stocks, & more",2022-01-26 00:47:27+00:00,18,E5rgifHtFiE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5rgifHtFiE,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hey everybody luke growman fftt hope you are well thank thank you for joining me tonight i really appreciate everybody for submitting questions i always really enjoy these interactions so thanks for submitting the questions and let's jump right in the first question is from df can you see a scenario in which asset prices decline while consumer goods inflation rises i would think it would have to be something that disrupts global supply chain severely again so uh open war with russia and china one or the other or both some sort of of pandemic some sort of global uh uh or or regional electronic magnetic event right uh that disrupts uh the internet etc those types of things i think is what you would need to get consumer goods inflation up and asset prices down kind of like what we saw in the very early days of of of co from the next question uh from kp george gamon and joseph wong discussed yesterday growing foreign concern about us debt to gdp and that it might manifest itself in higher rates for the credit risk could we see a situation of plenty of demand just at higher yield and how sustainable or unsustainable would that be it depends on the level of the dollar if you get the dollar up you're going to have less demand for treasuries foreigners have borrowed a bunch of dollars higher dollars squeezes that they have to sell some portion of dollar assets which they own 18 trillion dollar net uh they need to sell some portion of those assets to raise dollars uh the easiest thing to sell are treasuries they own 7 and a half trillion of those so you're going to increase net effective treasury supply if the dollar goes up so higher dollar less demand for treasuries okay lower dollar is all else equal higher demand for treasuries however and then the reason for that is lower dollar drives higher global growth frees up balance sheet capacity global liquidity some of which will be recycled into treasuries it also improves certain fx hedged treasury yields uh across certain major fx pairs like j japan excuse me uh all of which means that if you get the dollar down a little bit treasury demand improves all sql however if you get the dollar down too much you're going to get inflation to pick back up and now that's going to hurt treasury demand so there's a window stronger dollar bad for treasury demand little bit lower dollar good for treasury demand lot lower dollar bad for treasury demand so there's this window right and that window is shrinking as debt rises and as foreign denominated foreign dollar denominated debt rises so you have this shrinking window right uh rates okay if rates go up rates go up there's more demand equal absolutely but to the extent rising rates drives a stronger dollar we're right back to 0.1 that's lower demand that's not necessarily going to help uh and so you have the small and shrinking window basically we need a goldilocks lower dollar and like i said the more debt goes up the smaller that window gets at some point there is no level of the dollar where this makes sense relative to where the debt is they the window closed closes once the window closes you're going to need some form of qe uh dollar liquidity injection uh maybe even yield curve control um and that is sort of a singularity if you will that we are approaching at an accelerating pace uh we're not there yet we're approaching it we're accelerating towards it uh personally i don't care about getting the timing right i own gold bitcoin is too my biggest positions i'm unlevered i'm not reporting monthly results quarterly results so i don't care i don't need to get the timing exactly right uh but i the reason i feel that way is barring an economic productivity miracle the size and scope of which that i do not see on the horizon in terms of being commercialized yet uh it's pretty clear to me where this train is heading and so i don't know how long it's going to take us to get there i know the train's moving faster i know i'm well positioned and so i'm just sitting back and and enjoying the view from uh enjoying the ride in the view and and uh you know with a popcorn and a beer and seeing where this how this all plays out from sp what is your common man's suggested asset allocation to best weather the storm that lies ahead many of us have relatively large positions of our wealth in 401k plans and other employer sponsored plans with limited investment options how best should the little guy be positioned uh these should be taken as rough guidelines ways of thinking uh everyone's situation is different so huge caveat there what i in my opinion average person should have 10% of their funds in physical gold bullion maybe one to 2% in bitcoin those two things essentially hedge the currency debasement that seems highly likely to occur over the next 5 to 10 years if not much sooner uh i think with the rest for the average uh within the constraints of an average sort of you know 401k or corporate sponsored plan uh a group of diversified equity funds and some short-term bonds and money market funds i think i i think you you'll do just fine you're getting a short-term yield a nice one at that um equity should do fine in a sort of currency debased um uh inflationary secularly inflationary environment and the thing i would avoid generally speaking are long-term bonds uh the one caveat to that is to the extent you have a mortgage and that mortgage is fixed rate longterm and say under 4% uh i don't think it's a bad thing to put you a chunk of that money in your retirement fund into long-term bonds i would not exceed the principal value of your long-term fixed rate mortgage my thought here is if you can clip a a high grade coupon high-grade bond fund coupon long-term in your 401k tax deferred at i don't know 5 and a half six 6 and a2 while your mortgage is three three and a2 tax deductible all of a sudden you're the bank you're making a spread essentially risk-free only risks you're taking essentially that no one's going to no one's going to seize your 401k and i i don't think that's going to happen so that's the scenario in which i would consider owning long-term bonds i that beyond that i don't think they're a very attractive risk reward at all term premiums are still negative on 10year treasuries that is a a fancy way of saying the market is not demanding any premium uh for inflation risk in 10e treasuries makes no sense um just means they're being very short-term focused in my view so uh those are my thoughts like i said it's a guideline it's not hard and fast but those are the types of things uh that's how i would recommend to my mom my dad my mother-in-law etc uh from husker yen dollar is back knocking at the 150 level the higher it goes the weaker the end is ramifications of a breakout higher uh 10year treasury yields would probably go up sharply um maybe nonlinearly if you look over the since 2020 uh 10-year treasury yields and the yen dollar cross rate have been very tightly correlated the weaker the yen gets the higher the 10e goes 10 year yield excuse me uh the higher the 10e goes uh it's probably bad for stocks equity volatility up stock market broadly speaking best case probably is just really choppy to down uh it's probably negative given the higher rates for housing stocks commercial real estate stocks uh ultimately you would expect it to show up in renewed heightened treasury volatility i don't think it would take very long and we have as we've been talking about ad nauseum seen repeatedly since 2019 how the fed and or treasury deal with heightened treasury il liquidity or dysfunction which is more dollar liquidity which is then good for risk bonds stocks bad for the dollar and we go back to this whole increasingly uh rapid repeating cycle we've been going through over the last three four five years so those are the thoughts there from jm do you agree with lori logan at dallas fed so given the rapid decline of the overnight reverse repo balances i think think it's appropriate to consider the parameters that will guide a decision to slow the runoff of our assets she said this about a month and a half ago uh i guess early january uh we have had a couple hot prints since then uh in terms of inflation all else sequel though yes i do agree with her in my opinion the why it needs to happen the why in my opinion they are talking about it is they need a weaker dollar back to the point i made earlier they need a weaker dollar to make the fiscal math work uh so bond market's still very focused on inflation unemployment sort of the classic dual mandate it's not paying enough attention still to that shadow third mandate in my opinion uh treasury market functioning so uh critically uh good friend of mine pointed out that you know summer of 2022 inflation was just way too high for them to not tighten to for them to not keep going inflation isn't all the way back to their target now but it's close enough for government work as as my grandfather used to say so uh with inflation close enough to their target for government work it does give them the leeway to ease sequentially at the very least to keep that dollar moving downward gently because again too much stronger dollar they got big problems in their hand they're going to lose the long end they get a much weaker dollar they got big problems on their hand they're going to lose the long end they need the goldie blocks dollar weakness to try to get through that window that eye of that needle so those are my those are my thoughts there and then final question from jason if china decided to default on foreign debt obligations how outsized would the impact to global markets be respective to if the uh um gie were to do likewise or maybe us were to do likewise my understanding is they hold significantly more of their own debt please correct me if if i'm wrong for me i really don't think china would do that or would even consider that um outside of really open war and the reason i think that is is they are successfully internationalizing the ian for invoicing of oil gas and commodities full stop they are wall street journal last week end of last end or excuse me not last week end of last year said 20% of the world's oil physical oil last year traded outside the dollar um a lot of that youan putin said exactly that basically in his interview with tucker carlson two weeks ago uh point here is that if they were to default on foreign obligations that takes all of that trust all of that progress and it throws it in the trash it lights it on fire and so i think the chinese are playing a very different game or have a very different set of goals than much of what i see on a day-to-day basis in the us western financial media where it's all about managing the quarter managing perceptions for the next week for the next month what are next month's numbers what are next quarter's numbers when's the next election two years from now 18 months from now 6 mons it is a matter of utmost national security for china to be able to invoice commodities in their own currency full stop they need need to do that or they are in way worse trouble than any of the commercial real estate trouble and the stock market trouble like that's like that's like baby trouble the real trouble is if they lose all of the progress that they have gained in being able to invoice commodity imports in yuan that gives them flexibility that is the game-winning move for them nothing in my opinion will be done done that interrupts that they will rather take the shortterm pain in commercial real estate and stocks and all these other little or markets the big kahuna is the trade it's the balance of payments if china does something to try to ameliorate one of these little market problems they're having by defaulting on foreign debt or whatever again outside of war they will blow up their balance of pay payments they will risk blowing it up right now all of a sudden the world's going to say no more youan for oil we want dollars china's importing a trillion trillion plus in commodities a year maybe it's 800 billion if commodities are down it's a lot huge pressure on their balance of payments now they're not going to do anything in my opinion that that puts that at risk so hopefully that helps from a context standpoint as always if you enjoy these updates check us out fft t-c about what we're up to and about our tree rings product 10 most interesting things every week what grabbed our attention about him uh about each thing and and whether it's making us think uh more strongly about a way we've been think thinking about the world or or maybe changing our view of the world uh relative to how we had been thinking about it before we read that that thing so as always thank you for joining me look forward to catching up with you soon everybody have a great

How far can Fed push tightening? Where will problems emerge for Fed overtightening? & More,2022-01-12 14:00:34+00:00,14,rwTjrVyE1Zg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwTjrVyE1Zg,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke growman fft hope you are well well hope everyone is having a good week so far big super bowl week i don't know who uh who you got chiefs or 49ers should be a good game though so i'm excited to see it on sunday as always thanks for submitting questions really appreciate it very helpful uh great way to help uh hone refine change my thought process so thank you for the uh question submissions and with that let's jump right in and touch on a few of them uh from first from jrm where if anywhere does the chance of outright deflation in for your macro viewpoint in the shortterm versus the long-term uh shortterm openly admit and acknowledge that that you could have a brief period of deflation it would probably have to be from some sort of very severe external shock uh beyond the short term though uh the us debt situation at 120% of gdp and again i pick on the us because the us is the reserve currency issuer dollars a center of the system uh beyond the shortterm us debt of 120% of gdp us deficit of 7 to 8% of gdp with unemployment still three in change um net international investment position of the us at 65% all of those things combined went overlaid with foreigners who have borrowed $1 13 trillion in us dollar denominated debt means that any sustained deflation will lead to uh a treasury market dysfunction if it's not ameliorated immediately with more dollar liquidity that will lead to treasury auction failures i don't think it's going to happen i'm simply describing the mechanics of what would happen were the fed treasury to stand aside in case of deflation uh and and critically we know multiple times now september 19 march 2020 september 2022 march 2023 october 2023 november 2023 three we know that treasury market dysfunction will not be abided by the fed and or treasury and uh that is ultimately g on a secular basis for assets that benefit from currency de basement stocks real estate bitcoin gold and and critically even if for some freak of nature fed and treasury did stand aside and let an auction fail again it ain't going to happen but let's be hypothetical i think you'd still see currency debasement assets like gold in particular bitcoin as well um self- custo uh do well uh so the the the threat of deflation does inform my macro viw both in the short term in terms of risk management of look it could happen and so that's why i repeatedly say you want to be unlevered uh i i have a pretty strong conviction about the endgame the path from here to there is is uh can go a lot of different ways so in the short run you sure you could have a brief period of deflation however it really more informs my macro view from a a margin of safety standpoint uh or even from sort of i like to think about the world as like my back up against the wall okay back up against a wall now i know nothing's going to get me from behind i can see everything in front of me now what the back up against the wall view here okay we could have a little bit of deflation sure it's it is conceivable that's the back up against the wall view make sure a little bit of deflation doesn't take me out on my shield and then if that's the case we have pretty pretty high conviction uh very high conviction that treasury market dysfunction will not be abided for very long and then we can go forward from there uh from grony at what point does yellen or powell need to weave in the dollar to provide liquidity for the treasury bond market how that march cut is off the table on the small banks and commercial real estate don't matter uh let's see so i ultimately i think you watching what we're seeing in c it's maybe starting to get a little worse again obviously nycb has traded uh not so hot the last few days uh to put it mildly uh ultimately dollar liquidity i think has to be added soon um true interest expense or back which is entitlement pay goes plus uh treasury spendings back to 100% of receipts in uh fiscal four excuse me calendar fourth quarter fiscal first quarter um so what that means in plain english is if you don't get it soon we're going to go right back to that 3 q23 regime of dollar up gold up treasure yields up everything else down wash rinse repeat until uh we get enough treasury dysfunction that that authorities have to step in and enough is you know for example we saw that that five basis point tail on that i believe it was a 30-year auction back in early november that's that was never supposed to be able to happen yet it happen so at any rate uh ultimately the fiscal situation being where it is i think mandates that we're going to get more dollar liquidity soon um don't know what the catalyst is um let's watch as as as i like to say uh from brusk looks like it's all an anti-d dollar trade now luke down to the one minute chart and including treasuries as a risk on trade rather than risk off has the whole world collapsed down to the fftt view uh in my opinion it's more mechanics that are driving this um my sense and i could be wrong about this uh my sense though is that most investors have not accepted that the us is back in fiscal dominance again um nor have they accepted the implication the second derivative implication of that which is that the fed's shadow third mandate of treasury market functioning will dominate again the mandates of uh the other two traditional dual mandates of of of unemployment and low inflation uh the interesting thing though is is i think the this these sort of debasement trades the core trades expressions of this gld over tlt bitcoin over tlt s&p 500 over tlt uh the way these look on longer term charts suggests that mr market is already playing by these fiscal dominance rules and has been really for the last couple years uh even as most investors i think are still playn by the old rules and and sort of a a nod to a famous uh bob ferell quote uh from the famous maril lynch strategist so um i don't know if the world's collapsed to that view or not but i think mechanically this dynamic that that if the once the dollar gets too strong everything else goes down other than gold really uh we're seeing that more frequently and critically where we are in the fiscal update after uh the tbac report last week um we're we're getting close to a critical thr threshold again almost back where we were in august of uh of last year so we're got to keep very close eye from henry what does it tell you now that interest payments exceed national defense spending and that's gross interest spending uh in the latest treasury borrowing advisory committee report uh let me go back in time so back in i believe it was a second quarter of 2016 we wrote a report for clients uh we first looked at this as the big what we call the big three expenditures so the the biggest three things that the us government spent money on that could not be cut and they were uh entitlements social security in health and human services so medicare medicaid uh defense and treasury spending and back then treasury spending was actually below defense very quaint um at any rate we called those the the big three entitlements defense interest and when you total those big three up they were about 89% of tax receipts in the second quarter of 2016 in this report we ran through some different scenarios of where they could possibly go based on rate hikes based on recession so on so forth and what we what we guesstimated in that report was that by 2020 maybe mid 2020 late 2020 the big three would hit 100% of receipts and that could potentially be problematic uh reality was is that the big three hit 100% by the third quarter of 2018 less than two years later um ultimately the resulting crowding out dollar up risk off uh forced contributed certainly if not forced uh the fed to stop hiking in 4 q18 uh and then cut in 2019 and so fast forward to today where are we the big three are now 125% of receipts and rising they're going to rise a lot this year because the average treasury uh interest rate right now coming into the year is about 3.1% i think it easily closes the year you've got 9 trillion to refinance this year you're probably looking at 3 and 1 12% average rate minimum um exiting this year unless rates are slashed um and so what this tells us then at 125% with unemployment at 3 and a half% only or 37 wherever it is it's still near the 60e lows um it tells us that barring you you got to get a productivity miracle or you're going to have to slash spending on dod or entitlements prob both probably politically impossible certainly in an election year uh you're going to have to slash rates or you're going to have to devalue the dollar or effectively do some sort of new massive dollar liquidity and in our view uh more liquidity is the only politically and economically palatable uh answer ultimately that informs our macro view uh and and our our heavy gold and bitcoin positions but it also informs our heavy short-term treasury position um which we hold all of which unlevered uh because one thing we should have learned from this what is effectively the us government crowding out global dollar markets global rates markets is that volatility is likely to remain high in global rates and global effects which means it'll likely to remain high in global risk assets as well and again we feel pretty strongly about the most likely endgame but the path uh we need to be prepared for high degree of volatility not just in the classical stuff that we've all seen it in for a long time stocks commodities but also in things that are relatively new rates volatility g7 rate volatility g7 fx volatility and then the final question is uh wr at what level do interest payments on the us debt start pushing the rate of inflation higher uh the broad answer to that in my view is when the us fiscal situation starts forcing the fed and or treasury to intervene in the treasury market one way or another in order to keep it functioning and in that case my answer would be september 2019 repo rate spike um that was ultimately there were some regulatory issues to be sure that that were balance sheet constraining but the bottom line it was too much treasury supply not enough demand not enough balance sheet uh yes balance sheet capacity was restrained by regulatory rules however repo went from one or two wherever it was percent to 8 to 10% overnight fed came in within 48 hours more liquidity that's when the inflation i think the fiscal situation ultimately started that's where i date it to uh started really driving inflation you can make an argument that it started in 4 q18 when it forced the fed to stop uh raising rates um as we as i noted uh back uh a few moments ago uh certainly there's a case to be made for that so with that i'm going to finish up for tonight as always thank you very much for joining me uh enjoyed it if you like these updates check out fft t-c docomo 10 most interesting things brief synopsis about what grabbed our attention about them and and how it's either supporting confirming or refuting a way we had been thinking about the world before

"Potential US Fiscal Path From Here, Is QE Money Printing or Not, & More",2021-12-21 12:15:05+00:00,18,VCAe4lVEpgs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCAe4lVEpgs,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hey everybody luke growman fftt hope you are well wanted to thank you for joining me thank you for submitting questions always very helpful always very uh just helps with the thought process so really appreciate it i'm going to jump right in uh first question is from sp with your view shifting on recession would you be allocating more to equities at current valuations uh the short answer is yes uh of course it's always dependent on time horizon uh but when you look out i think over the next 3 to 6 to n months yes you've got 8 .8 trillion in cash and equivalence according to the wall street journal as of last week you have still favorable sentiment on long-term us treasury bonds long-term bonds in total uh and the us fiscal situation is acute right now uh or certainly getting there we measure that by true interest expense entitlement pay goes plus gross interest as a percent of uh that's true interest those two as a percent of receipts are nearing 100% again which has been the mark in the sand where more dollar liquidity is supplied where treasury dysfunction rises we were nearing that point in the third quarter of last year dollar liquidity increased uh ultimately you need a secularly weaker dollar you need more dollar liquidity secularly uh we saw in 2020 and 2021 that uh the best way to boost tax receipts and lower treasury issuance uh was to create and everything bubble to inject dollar liquidity so i think that lesson was learned i'm not saying we're going to get uh things as crazy as they were in 2020 and 2021 i wouldn't rule it out but that's not my base case but i do think dollar liquidity dollar liquidity will be supplied when it's needed through this year and that's good for stocks and and you've got the dried powder in terms of the cash and the still net favorable views on long-term treasuries from sm you recently said you don't think we will have a sustained recession my takeaway was because the government can't afford it so they will act aggressively to mitigate sl stop any economic downturn but unemployment has turned up slightly and although they may fudge the job statistics they can't fudge the tax collections if unemployment begins to accelerate like at the start of every typical recession do they start lying about the unemployment numbers so tax receipts and debt issuant are really the number to watch or what happens if this un if this if this employment recession session occurs um great question i i agree that tax receipts and debt issuance are the numbers to watch that are uh not as um hedonically adjustable shall we say uh also keep in mind within the tax receipt numbers and and the derivative issuance treasury issuance numbers there's at least two levers which is to say employment it's kind of classic number of jobs pay raises hours worked etc but also stock prices uh 60% of of income tax receipts which are half roughly of total federal receipts are paid by the top 5% of taxpayers uh these folks are not making the marginal dollar in a lot of cases not making most of their comp based on cash comp they're bas it's it's heavily stock driven asset price price driven so uh for example last year unemployment really didn't move up much and receipts at their worst were down 20% year-over-year on a trailing three-month basis that was all stocks that was all a hangover from stocks uh against relatively tough comps from a year prior so uh that also i think ties back to the first point which was and my first answer which is they know they can juice receipts by juicing stocks on a slight lag and so uh that lesson was learned i think that lesson was taken to heart and i think that lesson will be applied through this year i think it's bullish stocks and it is on some level intellectually offensive but i don't make the rules i'm just trying to play the game as the rules have been laid out for me so next question ek jim bianco suggests the route will be in the bond market rather than the equity market the 10year treasury going over 5% soon uh i agree that there is way more of a bubble in us treasury than in most us stocks certainly there's probably some that that the valuations are a little crazy but broadly speaking i think the treasury market is much more of a bubble than us stocks uh in terms of where the 10year treasury y goes 5% proved to be a pain point uh for the us government in the third quarter for that market for the treasury market uh and 10e treasuries in the third quarter and so i'm not sure it gets all the way back to 5% before more dollar liquidity is added one way or another in response to rising treasury market dysfunction one way or another uh in the short run rising yields particularly when they are disorderly rising uh that's bad for stocks as well as bonds obviously but bigger picture i don't disagree with jim's broader point as as i understand it which is and i think maybe the market is starting to sniff this out a bit we'll see but the us government can't afford positive real interest rates on on treasuries uh particularly at the at the long end and that's very bullish for stocks ultimately uh on a secular basis away from you know the next the next week the next month from tb can you steel man the bullish case for the us economy and the us dollar uh they're two different steel cases uh if the dollar goes up too much and too much is a u subjective number uh if it goes up too much it will crush the us economy it will crush the us bond market the treasury market stock market and the global economy uh a rising dollar ultimately in the presence of $1 13 trillion do in offshore dollar denominated debt forces selling of dollar assets uh $18 trillion net $7.6 trillion in treasuries sell what you can not necessarily what you want to uh we saw this play out strong dollar and 3 q20 22 in 1 q23 in 3 q23 dollar got too strong and the treasury market even in disinflation particularly in 3q we were very disinflationary yes the gdp numbers are going up but inflation was coming down and the bond market was really getting hit um and that's the the spiral you go into dollar up rates up stocks down receipts down borrowing up dollar up rates up wash rins repeat uh until either the dollar is weakened via more dollar liquidity supplied by treasury or fed or the system comes unwound um and to be clear fed could have stood back and told all the banks after the signature valley and silicon valley st sell your treasuries we told you to buy them for liquidity now here we are yeah i know you're down 30% yeah i know you're insolvent and some of you if you sell them down here go raise equity i know that's going to weigh on the equity market so what i know that might cause the deposit runs so what that's what happens it's very binary here so unless uh once the dollar gets too strong that process starts uh and it is a nonlinear process in terms of the speed so far every time that process has started over the last 15 years and in particular since the repo rate spike of 2019 the fed has hopped to it with more dollar liquidity or the treasury has done same in the case of three and 4 q22 and into early 2023 that's the bull case on the dollar is effectively the fed stands aside and says sell the treasury so that's a massive deleveraging and uh to be clear the most bullish case for the dollar is the global system completely collapsing um your dollar could be at 2300 and you're going to have supply chains breaking down globally um so it'll be very much a paradox uh in terms of steel manning the bullish case for uh stop for the us economy the us is in fiscal dominance uh in essence the us cannot afford its true interest expense without keeping real rates negative uh and that means real rates will ultimately be kept negative on a secular basis in my view and uh the us economy and us asset prices and us uh receipts they should respond very favorably to secularly negative real rates as they historically have so will inflation over time so i to me the bullish case on the economy is is where we are now um it's a nominally bullish case it's not necessarily bullish for real gdp but it's bullish for nominal gdp um which is all that matters when you have a lot of debt the bullish case for real gdp is some sort of productivity miracle um rolled out and commercialized pretty soon uh from aa in trump's speeches he says he won't cut entitlement and will drill baby drill plus he was pro low rates during his presidency how does this fit with your thesis of fiscal dominance energy and a trapped fed uh perfectly in my view uh the essence of us fiscal dominance is that the us cannot afford true interest expense without negative real rates um they need to either cut entitlements can't defense can't or rates um and so he's telling you we're in fiscal dominance we're going to cut rates a productivity miracle obviously is the the other way out of that as we've talked about we're looking for it we don't see it uh not yet but we're hopeful maybe that'll change uh so to me trump's saying he'll cut rates and let the dollar be the release valve which is higher inflation over time also suggests that inflation is not as transitory this is just our this is a transitory disinflationary period uh let the dollar be the release valve and inflation be the release valve so i i think what he's talking about fits in perfectly uh from gs do you expect the continued weakness in the price of oil to break short term over the next 3 to six months or longer term night to 12 months my my thought process on oil is i think evolved not even i think has evolved to the point where where my base case is at oil trades in the $65 to $85 range uh for the next 3 to 12 months barring some sort of geopolitical calamity uh the lower price at $65 below that too much for too long you're going to start to hurt shale that is a big geopolitical no no that begins to seed the oil market to opec and to russia uh and i think the us authorities have shown they do not want to allow that to happen and so i would not be surprised if us authorities anytime were oil to get below 65 start talking about refilling the sp or weakening the dollar whatever it takes to keep it above 65 flip side the top end of that range $85 is where we know oil begins to force foreigners to sell treasuries uh to raise dollars to finance their current account deficit caused by too high of oil prices said simply above 85 is where you start to see countries like japan and to a lesser extent china sell dollars uh sell treasuries to raise dollars to buy oil and that starts to put pressure on the treasury market given the supply demand situation which is already tenuous to be uh kind so 65 to $85 i think oil will trade in that range this year it's not very sexy um in my opinion the release valve to dollar liquidity will no longer be or is maybe not will no longer be but will be less really driven by oil and more driven by gold more absorbed by gold in other words price of gold goes up the gold the oil ratio goes up secularly continues to go up secularly and that makes sense given that we're seeing gold go back into the system as a neutral reserve asset uh at the central bank level and then finally from gr there was an interview on tucker carlson an astrophysicist was talking about how we would be able to find much more oil if we would just dig deeper thoughts and would that potentially be a productivity miracle is mining deeper too expensive to accomplish uh in short there's there's plenty of oil it's all just a question of price uh lots more oil at cheaper prices is a productivity miracle or some sort of utilization technique that results in the same thing in other words we come up with some new carburetor that takes miles per gallon on average of the us and global car fleet to 60 m a gallon or 80 m a gallon no matter what kind of car you drive that's a productivity miracle uh did oe other types of energy that might accomplish the same thing relatively turnkey uh lots more oil at the same or higher prices uh doesn't really change the dynamics of the game a whole lot uh that higher price of oil continues to make storing treasury bonds as your primary reserve asset unattractive because if you need higher and higher oil prices in order to keep supply growing you don't want to hold a fixed income instrument as your savings vehicle because it's going to lose purchasing power in oil terms in energy terms and you're going to lose uh standards of living uh over time and that is a political problem everywhere in the world um not least of which uh in some of these authoritarian countries be they oil net importers or oil net exporters so with that i'm going to wrap up for tonight i want to thank you for again for joining me um if you like these updates uh check out fft tt- llc.com for more information about our tree rings product 10 most interesting things uh brief synopsis about what grabbed our attention about them and why it is either refuting or confirming a way we had priv previously been thinking about a particular theme or or thesis or uh macro dynamic we're watching so thanks again for joining me everybody have a great rest of your week look forward to chatting soon take care [music] [music]

"Fed Taper, Inflation needed to de-lever US debt, What will force Fed to “choose a horse”?",2021-12-07 16:53:22+00:00,18,lMEs1nzwG18,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMEs1nzwG18,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hi this is luke growman from fft hope you are well i'm going to jump right into our bi-weekly uh q&a i really appreciate everyone that submitted questions uh going to run through a few of them here and uh then get ready to watch uh tonight's national championship game which uh i think is going to be a really good one so from the first question jim is it possible for global asset prices to decline while global liquidity is growing china has the pedal to the metal and the timorous article this weekend in the wall street journal makes it look like the fed is heading that way too and the timorous article uh by way of context was noting um that i believe it was lori logan head of the dallas fed former head of the uh uh new york fed trading desk uh saying that they may need to uh slow the pace of qt um and so in short in my opinion no it's not possible um for global asset prices to decline while dollar liquidity is uh rising global liquidity is rising so i i think you could see to me it's it's a question of relative sensitivity um and i think we're seeing you know bitcoin's doing really well i've continued to call that the the last functioning smoke detector of liquidity and it's functioning and it's telling us uh liquidity cometh so um next question is from tj could you please explain why the dollar rallies when saudi arabia sells oil to china and r andb instead of dollars it just seems like there is less dollar demand from the south ities when oil that was previously bought in dollars is now bought in rem andb uh it comes down to the context in which uh that modest diversion of oil volumes away from the dollar toward rem andb would occur and what i mean by that is uh the there's a large persistent bid for dollars out there by virtue of how much offshore dollar denominated debt there is the euro dollar system and so you have big dollar demand all the time if you have a shift even a marginal shift of oil volumes out of dollars into rmb you're going to constrict um new dollar volumes into that very strong dollar bid new dollar supply will be constricted into that very strong dollar bid by even just a little bit on the margin but prices are set on the margin so little bit lower dollar supply very strong dollar demand means dollar up the the the flip side of the same coin is that you would be increasing renman b volumes when you shift just a little bit of oil from dollar to rem andb uh into a world where there's just not a lot of incipient rem andb demand there's not a lot of offshore rem andb debt there's no euro rem andb system like there is a euro dollar system so uh little bit more supply of rmb not a lot of rem andb demand there weaker rem andb so technically in the short it's a technical dynamic mechanical dynamic it's short and and even into the intermediate term in terms of what that drives um and it's only dollar versus rem andb as we're seeing it's good for gold versus the dollar as gold serves as a neutral reserve asset we're seeing central banks adding gold um in place of treasuries and have been seeing that for the past 10 years and in spades in the last 2 three years uh long term it is is negative for the dollar uh because it is negative for treasury demand you don't reserve in treasuries as much at the central bank level when you're pricing oil more and more outside the dollars we can see this has happened this isn't speculative uh ultimately in the short run to the extent central banks don't buy as many treasuries it's actually again good for the dollar more treasuries offered not as much demand rates up that drives a dollar up until the dollar gets too strong and then for ers have to sell treasuries to raise dollars to service dollar denominated debt and that continues until you have treasury market dysfunction in which case the fed's got to print more to buy those treasuries one way or another and so it is ultimately uh bullish for the fed's balance sheet and so the process has been managed i would say fairly well obviously uh the fed's balance sheet sheet uh has receded off its highs um but if you would have said to somebody 10 years ago the fed's balance sheet's going to be 10 times the size it was uh at the peak after the great financial crisis 10 years from today uh they probably wouldn't have believed you but here we are so that is really you non dooll oil is bullish for the size of the fed balance sheet um and that is i think the key why it's ultimately i think negative for the dollar and in the long run uh from p will we get back into a deflationary environment visa v lacy hunt or are long rates headed above 5% uh the us government cannot afford deflation and the us government cannot afford rates long rates over five as we just saw uh based on how the treasury market u you know long bond uh long long long us treasury bonds uh crashed in the third quarter of last year they were down nearly 20% on tlt for example uh since since the us government cannot afford deflation and they cannot afford more rates above 5% at the long end tells us in my view that we'll have neither um at least over time i think we're going to have secular inflation with secularly negative real interest rates at the long end um long us treasury bond portfolios like hunts have done very well pretty much no matter what for the past 40 years it's been a case where generally up until at least 20 21 um long owning long us treasury bonds was a one-way trade they always went up basically no matter what uh in my view now long-term treasury bond portfolios uh will lose on either a real basis after inflation or on a nominal basis uh pretty much no matter what uh for a time because that's what the us fiscal situation demands uh the us is in fiscal dominance long-term bonds need to lose on a real basis over a sustained period of time uh many investors have forgotten uh that that real rates on bonds averaged negative - 1% from 1901 to 1981 uh per the ft last year there was a great article about that um so losing 1% a year on bonds on a real basis for 80 years has been forgotten because you made money every year on average on bonds on a real basis for the last 40 years and almost everybody still thinks the last 40 years were normal and have sort of blocked out what happened the 80 years prior uh i think they have begun to be reminded of that and i think they will continue to be reminded of that on average over the next decade i don't think long bonds are going to do very well at all relative to inflation for a simple reason the most powerful government in the world the united states cannot afford positive real rates for any sustained period of time until they get that the gdp lower uh and and that will allow them to be able to sustain their deficits a little bit better once that the gdp is lower after a sustained period of negative real interest rates from bb and d what do you think about the argument that holding bitcoin via micro strategy is better than holding it via etf since it's likely to continue to outperform spot etfs due to its carefully levered position in bitcoin um i don't have a strong opinion on uh either way micro strategy versus the etfs i understand the argument i just don't know one way or another the one thing i will say about it is something i would say about gold relative to gold etfs as well which is to say if you want to own bitcoin own bitcoin buy it self- custody it that removes all your risk other than the price action of bitcoin there's no exchange risk uh there there's no executional risk if it's if it's uh managed custody levered however there there's the second you sort of have some sort of agency risk introduced regardless of what that agency risk is for me if you want to own bitcoin own bitcoin so that's what i would say about it uh from ww felix zolof said in a recent interview that there are legal limits on the percentage of short-term debt that the us treasury can issue excuse me can hold relative to long-term debt i think you mean issue relative to long-term that have you heard about this and how would you expect yellen to handle the issue uh i was not aware of it if to the extent i i have no reason to assume that felix zolof doesn't know what he's talking about that i'm sure he does and so i would say that in my view any such legal restrictions like that would be mere speed bumps at some point for a quarter maybe two quarters at most and the reason i say that is because of something jeff gunlock pointed out in a speech recently that you can find online it's public on youtube at grant's 40th anniversary conference he had an interesting point where he pointed out that uh it was illegal to change the terms of mortgage back securities uh in 2008 and you know what when push came to shove they change the terms the change the rules he also pointed out that it was illegal for the fed to buy corporate credit in 2020 push comes to shove in 2020 they bought corporate bonds they changed the rulle rules my point here is probably pretty obvious now which is maybe that rule is there and that's why i think at worst it'll be a speed bump if they need to do it they will change the rules illegal legal doesn't matter in my view uh and then the final question from rn what do you make of doomberg recent opinion that peak cheap oil is a myth and that we we have officially shifted from a deficit era to an abundance era do you agree and if so so does that change your thesis long term um first off i will i will say i love doomberg work i think he is very bright and i think it is very well researched uh i disagree with let me let me back up i don't think our viewpoints are all that different on that uh on on it i think it's more semantical than a wholesale disagreement um i've if if you've listened to me talk about peak cheap boy over the years i've repeatedly said it's not peak oil it's not we're running out of oil it's that we've run out of the cheap oil it's that we need more expensive oil to continue to grow supplies to offset the decline rates of high decline rate shale and to um uh grow uh and offset uh decline rates on the existing installed base of conventional oil doomberg piece notes that uh some of it there is obviously i think he had raises a very good point about natural gas liquids which is like a straight line 45° angle and the fact that it is a byproduct to natural gas um means it's very very cheap and to the extent that then gets substituted in elsewhere it definitely helps on the supply side and to the extent natural gas is continuing to be drilled for that should continue to grow totally agree with that uh to me there is still very much a price sensitivity uh in the peran uh and the rest of shale um that supports the ongoing peak cheap oil theory or the peak cheap oil thesis which is to say the the permian is over half of us production and productivity is rolling over sharply uh within the peran um so i i think it is an interesting point that he makes about the natural gas liquids uh um and i i think you know he also highlighted that look some of it is as dollars priced or oil priced in dollars where if the oil if the price of the dollar weakens price of oil will rise um but that's not a peak cheap oil that's a dollar problem yes and no in my view ultimately multicurrency energy pricing which we've been talking about for a long time as well ultimately means the dollar should weaken against oil because now oil starts to become the pivot point if you've got some oil priced in yuan some oil priced in dollars uh you should get some weaker dollar against oil perhaps let me let me amend that because i just said that in the short run um cheaper uh or or or shifting oil to youan will make the dollar go up the dollar can be managed through oil um if if we want a weaker dollar and oil's priced in both dollars and yuan there are ways that policy makers would be able to weaken the dollar through the oil pivot aside of what the mechanical impacts of a stronger that that should drive a stronger dollar all else equal if left alone to market forces so uh oil can be used to weaken the dollar which then drives the dollar price of oil up uh in theory when you you can you you can use oil to weaken the dollar so i want to make sure i'm clear that i'm not saying two different things literally 5 minutes apart he also noted in in his piece that oil is getting cheaper in gold and we like i i i agree 100% on that and i think that's going to continue to happen um it really started when russia stopped buying treasuries and and has been buying gold basically as soon as russia began buying gold with oil that's just the world's second biggest oil exporter um bidding for gold with its oil effectively a few steps removed uh the gold to oil ratio show has risen markedly uh we've gone from 8 barrels per ounce to 24 26 barrels per ounce so over the last 10 15 years so um really since even since 2014 so over the last 10 years gold to oil the price of gold in oil terms has risen tremendously uh it just hasn't risen that much in in dollar terms so it speaks to doomberg point that it's a dollar issue uh ultimately the chinese need cheap oil the americans need relatively expensive oil and you can do that by strengthening the yuan versus the dollar a bit that weakens the dollar keeps oil higher relatively in dollars than in yuan so there's there's some levers there the bottom line to it is us the base of us oil production particularly as the over over half of it that's in the per and there's a baseline there there's a sensitivity there that the peak cheap oil in my view is absolutely still a factor whether you look at the decline rates the declining productivity in the peran or the fact that the other three big basins still have not retaken uh prior production highs so which which speaks to peak jeep oil as well so with that i'm going to sign off for the night as always if you like these updates check out fftc about our tree rings product 10 most interesting things brief synopsis of what grabbed our attention about them whether they uh support or refute a way we'd previously been thinking about the world uh and as always thank you for joining me really appreciate it look forward to talking with you soon take care

"Views on China, inflation, “what’s the bond market telling us?”, USD, BTC, & Gold",2021-11-24 14:00:03+00:00,15,39t7uL7VGZo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39t7uL7VGZo,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke growman fftt hope you are well hope you are having a great december i know i am last one of these for 2023 which is actually pretty hard to believe this year has blown by um it's been a lot of fun so uh i'm going to jump right in a lot of great questions so thank you for submitting those questions the first question is from may how much can the new eurasian rail line com compensate for the trade route disruption from the red se would that imply goods coming from southeast asia are rerouted through china or is that mostly already happening even without disruption on account of how it works logistically um it's a great question uh the the short answer is i don't know uh what i can tell you is i've not followed the red sea situation closely enough to to have any strong view on that uh what i have read on in the past has been the relative volumes being rerouted over the eurasian rail lines relative to to complete and total outbound volumes out of southeast asia and china specifically at least as of the last time i read in any detail on it the eurasian rail lines were a tiny fraction of total outbound seaborn container freight out of china and so at at given that the eurasian rail lines i don't think are anything to factor into this discussion which does seem to be more sort of a timing transit issue um and therefore a temp a temporary issue however i i do think it raises a really good point from a bigger picture perspective uh that i feel like is not getting enough um press or conversation in the mainstream and even in in sort of fin twit land about this topic which is it can be simplified by asking a question which is can the us navy interdict freight that has moved on rail across eurasia the answer of course is probably not and so uh i think it's an important question because china has known it has what it termed a mala issue straits of mala near singapore uh where the united states navy could theoretically close off and choke off a substantial portion of china's oil imports thereby choking the country to death in a very short period of time we hear about the mala the straits of mala the ability to choke them off with the us navy we hear that a lot what i do not hear a lot is what helen thompson noted in her book disorder which was the chinese knew they had a malaka issue in 2003 and immediately began working on the issue so i don't hear a lot as a counterpoint to that well the us navy can choke off china's oil yes i very rarely hear hey did you know this chinese have been working on their malaka issue for 20 years don't hear that a lot and i think it's an important question to ask and i think it's not only i think helen thompson that that it was a major reason why the chinese immediately started working on the pipelines across eur asia that have been put into place immediately began working on belt and road type initiatives eurasian rail type initiatives does that mean they'll work does that does it completely neuter the us navy no of course not however when you're only hearing one side of the story as i frequently am uh in terms of well the us navy can just choke everything off uh it's an important question to raise that i don't think is being raised nearly enough so i i know it's not an an answer but i think it's an important topic uh that that that current issues can bring up to start thinking about and discussing next question from andrew what happens when reverse repo hits zero uh don't know for sure but let's start with what we do know and work backward so the united states has a treasury supply demand and balance we know that uh we've got a lot of debt a stronger dollar higher treasury issuance made that way worse in 3 q23 since mid october uh the dollar has been weakened yell and shifted issuance to the front end um and that has led to more t- bill issuance and the reverse repo uh is the the balance is that in the reverse repo is it effectively amounts to what i would call herto for sterilized qe that then comes out of the reverse repo essentially to buy t bills to finance the deficits so the reverse repo is is helping yell and helping mitigate the us treasury supply demand imbalance uh so this suggests when reverse repo hit zero all else equal uh it should resume the treasury supply demand imbalance that we saw in august september of this year where you see the dollar up basically everything else down and treasury yields going up even though inflation was coming down uh however all else may not be equal uh weaker dollar can mitigate this us treasury buyback programs supposedly set to start in 2024 could mitigate this fed standing repo facility being widened out to hedge funds and all treasury holders as former new york fed uh president dudley wrote in bloomberg last month could mitigate this to be clear opening up fed standing repo facility to everybody that's qe that's just it's just not called qe uh central clearing of treasuries which was discussed last week apparently passed they're going to be rolling out that could that could uh increase or as that gets rolled out all else equal that freeze up balance sheet capacity across the system that could mitigate this it depends how fast any central clearing is rolled out last i saw it's not supposed to be ready till 2026 uh bank capital requirements being changed again vv treasuries like they were in 2020 to 2021 all else equal could mitigate this all of these things all else equal would add dollar liquidity they'd weaken the dollar they would free up capacity so it's important not to look at things in black and white all sql yeah yes no okay but there's a bunch of other things going on around that can make a big difference in terms of context so hopefully that offers some context and the different puts and takes around what happens when the reverse repo hits zero from pfg yields go up fin tweet says oh it's so bad yields go down this is the end it's so bad what is exactly the right thing now uh here too it depends on context uh yields go up with two strong a dollar and too strong an oil price that drives a debt death spiral rates up dollar up rates up dollar up uh yields go down with too weak a dollar can drive too much inflation uh you need to stay in a goldilocks region of just what's just right um the problem is that goldilux region is getting smaller and smaller and smaller because the debt is so high the deficits are so high and the us net international investment position is a percent of gdp is so big and so negative um the bottom line is the debt is not sustainable with too low inflation it's not sustainable with too high of inflation uh at least unless high inflation negative real rates so you need those sustained negative real rates but there's no suckers at the card table with a balance sheet big enough to sustain negative real rates uh holding debt through negative real rates with the debt as high as it is the only suckers at the card table with big enough balance sheet to the central banks so the real issue at hand is that the current situation is unsustainable the debt is unsustainable barring a productivity miracle the fin twit argument about whether high rates are bad or low rates are bad or whether up or down mostly if you really look at what's happening it's it's ideology people saying that inflated away or people saying default on it those are the two different sides high rates low high ratees bad low rate's bad whatever that's the two sides in the end they're trying to figure out who takes the loss the debtors or the creditors uh and in the end the sem these are semantics issues they're not talking about the real issue it's not sustainable the debt is not sustainable without a productivity miracle and so how are we going to default on it outright or by inflating it away uh from sr what is your view on the context contents excuse me of the book the great taking by david rogers web in case you have had a look at it already it is a it it and a documentary on youtube are available online it would be very grateful if you provide your take on the themes covered in it sometime i read the book in june or no i guess it was released in june i read it in sort of july or august i don't he david rogers web originally cleveland guy actually um i know of him i know i've known of him for a long time uh i don't know him personally uh he is very thoughtful he's long been known as very thoughtful he has been a very successful investor i know people that know him he's a real dude is what i'm trying to say like this is not he's not a crazy person i think ultimately if you boil down the book it highlights a very important uh and modern and bigger than ever version of a longstanding issue highlighted in a famous quote by lord acton which is this quote the issue which has swept down the centuries and which will have to be fought sooner or later is the people versus the banks end quote uh so this is just a a super sized version of that same problem here yet again that we go through on the long cycle that is usually a feature of a fourth turning culmination uh in terms of the legal aspect ps of the book i'm not qualified to comment my take is that at the very least one should be aware of the issues and the issues in short are that um the modern structure of the financial system is such that all of us in our 401ks we own stocks but we actually don't own the stock we do not have legal ownership to the stock we have beneficial ownership of the stocks in our 401k the legal ownership rights are actually through dtcc owned uh or serve as collateral to back the entire banking system which has very large derivative positions etc etc and so if the system has a systemic problem ultimately the collateral that can be used to recatalog i don't know the legal side to know to say that's correct or that's not correct um however dave has done his work he's a serious dude uh i take him at his word i don't think he has an ax to grind i think the book at the very least suggests that every investor should have a small percentage of their assets held outside of the banking system physical gold in nonbank vaults private vaults there's private vating companies that are not part of the banking system around the country uh bitcoin custody off exchange these types of thing uh and it can be a very small percent of your net worth it doesn't have to be a lot and here's why if web is wrong or if this never comes to pass if the systemic event that requires the grabbing of the collateral never comes to pass as described in the book then you've lost nothing you've had a couple percent in gold and bitcoin so what uh and oh by the way it probably goes up over time with inflation if web is right or if this does come to pass in some way shape or form it implies a value for your gold and bitcoin that more than offsets the collateral that you will be contributing to the system whether you like it or not per the book and you the past fruits of your labor will be made whole so that's my ultimate take on it in terms of practical implications for the average investor from cb energy is the economy you commonly reference an energy productivity miracle as a force that can mitigate much of the inbound financial trauma do you think widespread deployment of conventional nuclear could be the ticket disclaimer i am overweight uranium uh yes i do think it could be uh conventional nuclear could be a productivity miracle uh rolling it out needs to be done at a much greater degree of urgency than we are seeing because the interest on all this debt never sleeps in my opinion it would be good for uranium so that that's how i thought of that from wf 10year yield has dropped off a cliff do you expect it to keep rising yes for a simple but as yet still widely underappreciated reason fundamentally barring a productivity miracle the only thing keeping the united states government and all western sovereigns and really all sovereigns at that point solvent is the very infl infation that has now gotten down to levels that have allowed a rally in the tenure in other words low inflation let alone deflation means there is a risk of nominal default on western sovereign debt or the need to print to avoid said default two things have happened that have bought time that have helped spur this rally in the tenure which is a weaker dollar and a shift to the short end in terms of us issuance treasury issuance ultimately you need to have a sustained period of significantly negative real rates that's it that's that's the solution or some massive productivity miracle so um hopefully that helps clarify a little bit on that from ah can you explain in greater detail what treasury market dysfunction is and what it looks like uh sure it's in my view it's elevated volatility in the us treasury market per the move move index mov index harley bassman created that index in september of 2022 he said when that index gets to 150 the fed has lost control of the treasury market the fed losing control of the treasury market means that the treasury market the free market foreigners are dictating to the us government what they can borrow at and if they can dictate what you can borrow at that's a more powerful weapon uh than anything the us military has basically because they can shut off the borrowing of the us military right they're not going to the fed losing control of the treasury market is simply a non-starter uh that isn't going to be allowed to happen for very long at all uh that is also the risk-free asset underpinning everything else when a trades like dogecoin that indicts the value of everything else if it's allowed to persist over time uh you also then then tend to see weak treasury auctions uh large tails we've seen those uh and then i think to two a symptom is rising treasury yields with falling sequentially inflation that's not how it's supposed to happen when financial conditions loosen treasury yields are supposed to rise because they discount markets are forward-looking you should be discounting rising inflation when financial conditions tighten us treasury yield should fall at the long end because markets are forward-looking it's the safe asset people should be discounting deflation when you start to see what we've seen since 2022 which is when financial conditions tighten treasury yields go up and when financial conditions luan treasury yields go down as we have just seen happen since mid- october us treasuries are trading like emerging market debt they are trading like a risk on asset that is not how treasury traded at the long end for most of my career i've been doing this 28 years in some way shape or form so uh that gives some sense not just of what it looks like but the implications from rc luke can you explain explain as simply as you can why exactly a strengthening dollar drives treasury market dysfunction i know dxy is up up dxy bad for dollar denominated liability issuers and us exporters what am i missing a concept i cannot pin down in my brain uh sure so foreigners have $13 trillion in us dollar denominated debt according to the bis uh it might be more some people say a lot more if you uh in include euro denominated liabilities it's a great point wouldn't argue that also much of the world still needs to buy much of its energy in dollar terms and so those are the flow liabilities when the dollar strengthens the uh or let me back up foreigners also against those liabilities own $18 trillion net of us doll assets $50 trillion gross of uset assets and that is simply think of it as the us ran $500 $800 billion in trade deficits for the last 30 years plus foreigners took those dollars reinvested them into dollar assets and earned a return on them as well so when the dollar gets too strong foreigners need more dollars uhoh they're short dollars no they're not they have $50 trillion assets they just need to sell them and convert them into dollars which they do including $7.6 trillion in us treasuries that they have which are still the most liquid of those dollar assets so they get sold often first or can uh so dollar gets too strong us dollar assets go down us treasury bonds go down yields go up that is ultimately the rough mechanism of why it drives that critically still a lot of people out there talking about the soros imperial dollar cycle like it's 1984 1984 the us net international investment position was 10% of gdp positive in other words we owned 10% of american gdp more of foreigners than they owned of us there was no $50 trillion piggy bank of foreigners owning our assets that got sold when the dollar got too strong it didn't exist we had more over there we brought the dollars home when the dollar got stronger most there's still a lot of people thinking this is the way the world works doesn't empirically we've seen it net international investment position now 1984 was 10% positive of us gdp us net international investment position now negative 6 5% of gdp that's the ne that's the18 trillion foreigners own more of us that's the big difference dollar gets too strong those assets are going to get sold because they need dollars all right and then the final question tg what is the relationship of the bond market and the currency and which one will they sacrifice and why very very good question let's just think about it this way uh a us treasury bond is just a contract to receive dollars in the future that's a great characterization of it from my friend dan oliver mican capital when there aren't enough dollars or enough dollar velocity which is to say enough gdp activity to support the repayment of treasuries right to support the interest expense then either they default on the bonds or they print the dollars or otherwise devalue the dollars so that they can increase dollar liquidity and pay those treasuries back so there's that at its core is the fundamental relationship between the two given that treasuries are ultimately the collateral underpinning many sl most of the assets in the system and the banking system and the us government they will always choose to sacrifice the currency when the choice comes because if they sacrifice the bonds on a nominal basis they will sacrifice the bonds and the currency because what will happen if they sacrifice the bonds as you will have capital flows leaving the currency in question to go to safer havens and the currency will fall anyway so it's just a question of how long they let markets twist in the wind it's a question of the windiness of the path and the politics between here and there of save the currency save the bond market save the current in a fiat currency system where the government can print the money there are no examples of a government choosing not to print the money choosing to shrink itself in order to preserve the real value of the bond market which is to say they always choose the currency so hopefully that helps as i said this will be the last update for the year thank

How tech-induced deflation will likely force Central banks to fully reserve debt over time & more,2021-11-09 14:00:02+00:00,17,2M7XMOQhp8k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M7XMOQhp8k,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hey everybody luke growman hope you are well had a great thanks giving weekend here in the us i know i did uh got to enjoy it with family locally which always is a good time so uh unfortunately the ohio state buckeyes were unable to pull it out against michigan but uh some more good football coming up this weekend so we'll enjoy that in the meantime i'm going to jump right in thank you as always for the questions very helpful very thought-provoking really always enjoy them so thank you first question is from mt why is jim wrong uh jim biano uh who uh said the last time interest payments were burdensome was 1981 to 1988 during this period the us economy boomed interest rates fell stocks soared and living standards rose why the federal government could borrow to pay this debt burden um and jim had a great tweet out highlighting some of these issues um i would preface this by saying i i respect jim immensely i think he's a brilliant mind very good thinker uh asking me my opin opion on um his point in my opinion he's not wrong in my opinion he's leaving out an important piece of the puzzle in that in that uh x thread uh regarding that period of time which is to say the last time the us government's interest payment burden was as high as it is now was in late 1984 uh in early 1985 around february the dollar as measured by the dxy index peaked uh it fell sharply ahead of the plaza accord in which the dollar was weakened in september of ' 85 uh the dollar was down 25% off its all-time high from february 85 to september 85 and it ultimately fell over 40% in two years between february 1985 and early 1987 peak to trough in other words uh for the issues uh that jim highlighted to be resolved this way again and i think jim's right in highlighting these the dollar needs to go way lower like not a little lower like a lot lower uh the challenge in that is that our us trade deficit is much higher now than it was then our fiscal deficit is much higher uh the net international investment position of the us is way more negative than it was then it was actually slightly positive then um which means there's no assets to be attracted here there already all here um the the weakening the dollar as much even close to as much as it was weakened in 84 85 86 87 uh will likely drive nominal growth up enormously it will also probably drive inflation up uh and again our debt load was way lower back then so we could afford higher stronger growth higher rates uh the rates that would likely result from a much weaker dollar leading to higher growth higher inflation uh likely would put us interest expense um uncomfortably high and would probably necessitate some version of qe or yield curve control um financial repression by on the banks etc something like that so that is you know the big difference is are are the net international investment position of the us much more negative now 65% so there's not the capital to attract back home like there was in the early ' 80s back in the early ' 80s net international investment position was positive 10% of gdp now it's 65% of gdp so there was capital to attract back home capital is already all here uh and then secondly the debt to gdp is 120% today it was like 30% back then deficits are much higher structurally because of the boomer demographic so they can do the weaker dollar but it's going to feed on itself we'll get the nominal growth and i that's ultimately that's where i think this is going uh but i think it's going to be nominal growth probably with periods of of you know the fed won't want to call it qe they want to call it market functioning of treasuries the treasury market functioning purchases of treasuries or something like that or not qe or btfp or some sort of liquidity injection that they'll deny till the cows come home is is is qe but markets won't care yeah the markets will respond favorably to to any such liquidity so those are my thoughts on that appreciate the question and like i said i i respect the heck out of jim bianco i think he's a great thinker and and a friend so those are my thoughts on it uh from js the us eases but the rest of the world eases more thus we have a stronger dollar after years of printing no end in sight anything that could derail this uh i think we just saw what has begun derailing this uh in august september and october of this year which is to say stronger dollar in the face of 13 to trillion dollar in offshore dollar denominated debt that needs dollars to service uh and foreigners who can't print dollars but who have a dollar piggy bank when you hear me say net international investment position of 65% of gdp what you should hear is us doll piggy bank for foreigners of negative of 65% of us gdp or net $18 trillion of roughly $40 trillion gross uh including $7.6 trillion of treasury so if the dollar goes up foreigners get squeezed on their ability to service debt global growth slows us deficits get bigger us treasury insurance rises squeezes the dollar higher still uh as us government deficits crowd out global dollar markets and foreigners go to the piggy bank they go to the the us dollar piggy bank and they sell treasuries and they will keep selling treasuries what that's more treasury selling on top of what is already too much treasury selling it gets into a very vicious vortex which is all fun in games until the treasury market loses an eye until you start to see auctions do what we started to see them do uh two weeks ago with that 30-year auction with a five basis point tail which is like out um when you start seeing treasury volatility do what it did in early october late september um that ultimately is the governor on this at this point in the cycle which is to say the us government is not going to start laying off the united states marine corps they are not going to shut down the united states navy they are not going to tell 70 million baby boomers in an election year we're going to not pay your entitlements for the next six months because we have to pay interest to china it's not going to work that way what's going to happen they're going to weaken the dollar so i think ultimate there's a lot of different ways they can do that the fed doesn't want to poell wants to be a tough guy greates at the end they're going to have to weaken the dollar unless he is going to be willing to be the man responsible for forcing the us government to lay off the us marine corps close the us navy and uh tell boomers for the next six months in an election that they don't get their their benefits so that is i this this f us fiscal as the bottleneck remains very underappreciated in my opinion i think that's a mistake i think people need to be paying it it is it is the big it's bigger bottom like than inflation it's a bigger bottom like than employment uh next question from lt curious if your view on oil has shifted over the last month or so and how it fits into your portfolio strategy for 2024 no um not really uh it's not it's not felt great watching oil go lower um with that said uh there's expectations of pretty pronounced economic weakness uh now in oil's price in my opinion uh while peak cheap oil is still an issue um the other thing that's been of interest to me it's not i don't think it matters for oil anytime soon but watching alternative energy names and more important projects get significantly hurt by interest rates i think is an important signpost uh it tells us these alternatives that are supposed to play a major role in curtailing global fossil fuel usage over the next 10 years so that there's peak oil demand in 10 years or 8 years or whatever it's supposed to be these projects don't work at 4 or 5% is what the message is what we're seeing happen with these projects and markets and so if that's the case uh one of two things going to happen either they're going to lower rates which i think ultimately is more liquidity is good for oil all else equal or they're not and sort of these peak oil demands that are predicated upon you know at least a portion of them that are predicated upon uh rapid growth of uh alternative energy they're not going to come true and they're going to have to these these energy demand forecasts oil demand forecasts are going to have to be increased secularly uh versus 8 10 years ago you're start again you're starting to see hints of this when you see the uk back off on their electric car um uh outlooks for whenever it is six or eight years from now that's the type of thing you're going to be seeing more of so i still like oil um i don't feel like there's anything to really do at the moment i it doesn't feel good that it's down from whatever 92 94 to 74 75 78 wherever it's at but i'm not losing sleep over it i i don't think it goes to 4050 like it did in 1415 or negative or whatever failing an economic catastrophe like co simply given the peak cheap oil issues we've discussed so um you know ultimately i think the outlook for oil remains positive uh next question from sw you mentioned recently that the us needs a productivity miracle what which technological efforts are most likely to provide enough of an econom ic boost within the time frame that we need how can we rely on the us government to facilitate such developments rapidly uh the us government any government i don't think they'll move that fast but uh things like darpa within the us defense department different uh defense i mean keep in mind you the internet came out of the us dod uh a lot of the stuff we're using in consumer electronics today came out of dod so they've got god knows what skunk works um i'm sure they're working on stuff that's pretty cool um so there are some things that i'm sure we don't even know about with that said what can arrive and what can arrive on a timely basis and then what does timely mean so what can arrive to me these small modular nuclear fision reactors i think are really interesting there's some real progress there there's been some real world tests um that is something i think could be i think it's just nothing but a wind case um ai can be a huge productivity driver however ai robotics have a little bit of a of a of a um a blowback potential in other words if ai and and robotics happen too fast they risk causing so much productivity that you create political problems on the other side in terms of too big of layoffs etc tax receipts hits into a a a western sovereign fiscal picture broadly that is uh they can afford uh cannot afford hit to tax receipts so that kind of depends on on the pacing in terms of how soon uh i don't think any of these are going to come soon enough because compound interest never sleeps and we're seeing the fiscal picture hit levels in terms of uh true interest expense of treasury spending plus plus entitlements uh relative to receipts hit levels that are nearing critical thresholds uh that is generally um resulted in the dollar being weekend in relatively short order um so i don't think they're going to arrive before that you know so timely manner next 2 3 years maybe um i i think definitely think ai and robotics are probably going to be much more pronounced over the next two to three years that i feel pretty comfortable saying the small modular nuclear reactors um i' i've not seen enough to have a strong opinion on that one way or another uh from gr hearing some rumbling about reverse repo uh balances going to zero causing some issues this pool of money hasn't been around long is there any issues of concern here that connect to other probabilities you've talked about i have thought about reverse repo as a pool of stored up and sterilized qe so basically it was qe it created reserves and then it was sterilized by the fed's revers re basically prevented from going into the economy as the fed basically bribes the banks with the reverse repo to not loan or let the money go into the economy and that's probably an oversimplification but that's i think the gist of it so to the extent that that represents what or is accurate or directionally accurate for what reverse repo is then as reverse repo is drained essentially going into t- bill markets and t bills are being issued to offset government spending it amounts to sort of this stored up and sterilized qe coming back into the system to finance us deficits in the t- bill markets um and so treasury is shifting issuance to the front end will accelerate alll sql the draw down and reverse repo as i understand it and so if when reverse repo starts to get too low uh it will start to i think potentially create some concerns on on on on some of the you know the liquidity issues that we've talked about before dollar liquidity it should support the dollar it should be um non- stimulative if that's a word it should be contractionary if if the re reverse repo runs out uh while issuance continues to to grow a pace i mean there's some other stuff in money market funds you but it it it's um to the extent that it's sterilized and stored qe that's running out i think it's contractionary to the extent it runs out all else equal um is is how i'm thinking about it at the moment so hopefully that helps um quite honestly i've been uh i have to give the fed credit it's really um they've managed that well in terms of being sort of able to bleed that stimulus take that stimulus out that was sort of a real huge amount and sort of bleed it out over the ensuing uh two years uh with the buildup and then rundown of of reverse repo but that was that's going to be coming to a head it looks like in the first quarter so it is something important to watch um and and definitely paying attention to it uh and then the final question from cmc what do you think about the demographic dynamics of the world currently and their impact on growth uh i think it depends it depends on events there's in some circles a black and white view of young demographics are good old demographics are bad and i there's a real good chance that that view of the world is not just outdated but wrong uh no one for example nobody has better demographics in the world as far as i know uh than the mid east uh but lots of young unemployed people without um economic um opportunity can be very politically destabilizing as we've seen for a long time and as we've sadly seen uh in spades over the last month um ai and automation and robotics all combined uh run the risk of creating lots of youth unemployment with not a lot of hope for economic uh uh advancement or opportunity um if that happens all else equal the countries that have old demographics will probably have higher standards of living and more importantly be more politically stable than those with lots of young people paradoxically um older people don't protest violently to be blunt so uh that is the reason why i think it depends on events and how they unfold uh you sort of had some hints around that with this recent um open ai situation where you could read some of the hypotheses that there were some new programs to be rolled out or or um i'm not using a reg i'm not a techy guy i apologize but whatever this new uh ai um that there were some possibly there were reportedly possibly some concerns about the socioeconomic impacts of it on employment etc that's exactly what this speaks to in my opinion uh you take away hundreds of millions of jobs of young people around the world um that runs the risk of politically destabilizing the nations with the better demographics versus the worst demographics so i think it's something we all have to think about in terms of how rapidly um deflationary tech is and how exponentially uh some of this this really cutting edge stuff um uh in ai and robotics is growing and and what that implies so that's it for today i appreciate everybody joining as always if you like these updates check out fftt llc.com for more information about our tree rings product 10 most interesting things uh brief synopsis about what grabbed our attention about it and how it either

"Level of inflation that forces Fed re-think, Bitcoin ETF initial thoughts, & more",2021-10-26 13:00:31+00:00,11,kEPs5Vy61AI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEPs5Vy61AI,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke growman fftt hope you are well and having a great week thank you for joining me appreciate all the questions really helpful and thought-provoking which uh is is very helpful and uh always enjoy looking over them so with that i'm going to jump right in first question is from george what do you think the effects will be of this tremendous family fiscal impulse playing out and what he what he's referring to is boomers hold half of america's wealth but they're going to spend it on themselves before their kids have a chance to inherit their money according to business intelligence uh in my opinion in the short term uh it's it's stimulative and inflationary uh essentially us policy was to uh incent the boomers to defer compensation that would have added to inflation uh in the real economy throughout the 80s throughout the 90s throughout the 2000s uh by deferring that comp into asset prices and then us policy makers never counted asset inflation as inflation which was very convenient for keeping inflation low keeping inflation low which ultimately was all done in deference to the bond market uh in low inflation low rates makes it cheaper for the government to borrow okay that worked great until the boomers wanted to start retiring and wanted to start spending their money and now we have 40 years of paper asset gains that are now coming back into the real economy and causing sustained sticky inflation um critically uh the boomers are nearing the end of their lives uh that is a hard stop um and as a result there is little to no ability for the fed to change boomer time preference uh they can crash asset markets uh by raising rates really high um that won't work ultimately because the fed needs rising or the us government needs rising asset prices to drive rising consumption to drive rising tax receipts to service the debt we have um and there's really no rate the fed can raise rates to that is going to you know short of of just outright crashing boomer wealth dramatically uh there's no rate the fed can can raise rates to in any real way that will dissuade the boomers from spending um before it creat severe problems for the us government's ability to finance itself given 120% de to gdp so in the short run i i think it's ultimately good for growth good for inflation um in the intermediate term you would think a lot of this money will get spent on long-term care healthcare etc um and that has implications that would shift away from sort of more discretion consumer goods and services uh and then longer term as the boomers pass on i think it's essentially a lottery ticket to the extent the wealth um uh continues to be there um some portion of it i think it's essentially a winning lottery ticket for their kids uh goes to them um and the kids will be in a lot of cases just around their peak spending years so i think i think it's a a a trend of um you know it'll delever some of their kids right you can pay down college loans etc uh but ultimately i think it's a stimulative and inflation inflationary uh from sg how much longer until the dam breaks and we get a big recession or high inflation have your opinion shifted and two worst case scenario in middle east happens there's closures and disruptions or disruptions excuse me to the red and arab sea what happens next uh the def to the answer the first question my opinion shifted no uh why deficits of 8% of gdp and unemployment at 3.6% tells us one of two things or both are coming economic recession or high inflation or economic recession then high inflation it's only happened this gap has never happened this big uh as it is now between deficits and unemployment uh and we've shown that chart before you saw a brief moment in 2019 and before that you saw a moment in 1968 that's basically it when these two data series are moving in different directions and in both cases you ended up with sustained high inflation and in one case in particular co you had a nasty recession for a cup of coffee uh before you had that sustained inflation so i continue to think that's where it's going um i don't know if we get a nasty recession first and then we get inflation or if we just go straight to inflation and to be honest i is i'm i'm positioning as if i don't care uh i'm unlevered uh i have high conviction that we're going to end up at that end game one way or another and so it's just about getting my chips from here to there to benefit in terms of the worst case scenario in the middle east um i have no opinion on whether that's it's it's possible or not so take this with a grain of salt uh if you had closures or disruptions in key trade lanes in the red or arab sea you'd have oil up big gold up big dollar up big treasury and global sovereign bond yields up big in my opinion and stocks globally down big um if it went to outright war between great powers i.e us and russia us and china anywhere in the world uh i think you'd very quickly see capital controls across global markets in the west as well as in as in the east and i think you'd see rationing of commodities and i think sort of the world the commodity the the the global economy as we understand it and see it today would essentially cease to exist almost overnight so i don't think that's going to happen i also think that there's a there are some that hold a view that that could happen as a tail risk but that we would just continue to have the markets we have today and i don't think that's the case at all uh chris you if you were emperor luke and you wanted to move the us uh in line with brics plus and their vision of sounder money or more balanced trade what policies would you enact and how would you shape the narrative to do so so for me the bricks are just trying to push the world towards uh a uh multi-currency energy neutral reserve asset that floats in all currencies settlement in other words price oil and whatever you want settle net deficits in gold and a floating price of floats in all currencies that's where i think they are demonstrably uh moving the system toward with their actions if so what policies would you enact and how would you shape the narrative to do so bonus question would your plan look similar to what we're doing now uh i would do industrial policy investment in the us we're doing some version of that i would do skilled tra skilled trades and engineering college um trade school subsidies so uh you get free college if you go to school for engineering or for trade school uh in the skilled trades uh there would probably have to be a service aspect on the back end of it in other words if you take advantage of those subsidies and get free school you've got to work in that industry for eight years something akin to what uh you do with ry reserve officer training corps here in the us or uh the military acmy uh you go there you get free school and then you got to serve i think the obligation is uh 8 years active i don't know four or eight years reserves something like that but i think you could structure it in that way because right now we are not too many years away from having a uh supply problem in the skill trade and and to a lesser extent in engineering um so in some respects i do think we're seeing shifts in that direction ultimately once you had some momentum building in that direction i think you could do some things that would support uh the movement toward using uh gold as a neutral reserve asset ultimately bitcoin could serve that role too i just think between here and there is probably at the very least gold before bitcoin but we'll we'll see um and and settling deficits in in gold at a floating price would certainly do that but that would have to be down the road after we've backfilled some of the uh uh and re rehor and backfill uh the skilled trades and engineers we need to to to do those things uh from bill has japan lost control at this point is that a large enough factor to trible trigger global disruptions such as treasury selling in my opinion they haven't i'm um i i i think they are they what we're watching is a managed decline in the yen managed rise in japanese u in jgb rates uh japan has a lot of firepower in the form of their net international investment position um of dollar assets it's about 60% of japanese gdp positive held uh largely in dollar assets just think of that as a piggy bank that they can use uh to finance their own deficits um is they sell those assets to support their own currency uh finance their own deficits that ultimately throws the problem back onto the lap of the fed uh at the moment lower oil prices lower coupon issuance treasury coupon issuance per the quarterly refunding announcement last week uh slightly lower dollar uh all of these things are helping keeping uh the movements uh sustainable not not that disruptive so so far so good from max hi luke can you comment on the fed curbing rehypothecation of treasuries i.e effectively charging a hefty tax or full margin on leverage in the treasury market will this increase demand for treasuries meaningfully or is it rearranging deck chairs on the titanic and what max is referring to is something uh our friend stimpy wrote uh for what it's worth the sec is going to drop a bomb in treasury markets later this month with a full clearing mandate of customer trades with a short implementation deadline timeline the glory days of rehypothecation are over and deleveraging is going to securities finance like a mac truck uh essentially i don't know um the i've not seen anything i know basil has talked about it on some level but i don't know specifically about uh the legislation that is set uh reportedly set to hit according to stimpy later this month and and i know stimpy i know who stimpy is i would trust stimpy if he says it's happening um then that's something to be aware of i i have no reason to think he doesn't know what he's talking about because like i said i know who stimpy is he's really good so uh with that said it would essentially be deleveraging uh sharp deleveraging possibly and and yes in my opinion i agree it would drive demand for treasuries essentially it would be a large tax on leverage uh the problem is if it drives a decline in asset prices which it almost mathematically would be certain to do uh it would likely drive uh uh a recession a drive drive a decline in tax receipts um a recession through the consumption impact of the lower asset prices which we saw last year uh decline in tax receipts a rise in credit uh issues economy-wide a rise in the dollar uh and so when you sort of talk through each of those things a recession that's going to drive your deficits up on a slight lag by 6 to8 points of gdp that's $1.5 to2 trillion more in treasury issuance asset price declines hurt consumer spending they hurt tax receipts that drives issuance up for example last year unemployment never really budged asset prices fell tax receipts fell almost $500 billion uh so assuming you know theum so if we have a modest recession asset prices fall that would be another so we got one and a half trillion to 2 trillion on a modest recession more issuance 500 billion to a trillion more in in uh deficit more issuance on asset prices falling depending on the severity uh rise in credit problems uh economy-wide given the the leveraging uh that's going to force banks possibly to sell treasuries to raise capital uh they own $4.1 or4 trillion in treasuries and mortgage backs they could sell to raise dollars to address um credit losses elsewhere in their books uh and then the rise in the dollar that would ostensibly happen given uh a scramble for treasuries a deleveraging event um foreigners would also have to sell treasuries to raise dollars to defend their currencies foreigners currently own in total around $7.6 trillion in treasuries so would it drive demand for treasuries yes in all likelyhood it would for a moment uh in the same way that pouring gasoline on your furniture and your carpeting and then lighting it would keep you warm for a little bit however when you start talking about the amounts of net effective treasury issuance they could come to bear right two trillion deficit in a another 1 and2 trillion to 2 trillion if it drives a recession okay 2 plus 1 and2 is 3 and 1/2 another 500 billion because asset prices are down like 2022 okay that's uh uh what did i say one uh three and half that's gets us to four now the banks are going to sell let's say another 500 billion that gets us to 4 and a half billion in effective issuance now let's say foreigners sell another billion that's or another trillion excuse me billion that's cute uh another trillion 4 and2 plus another trillion minimum that's 52 trillion in net effective treasury issuance who's a buyer banks are selling feds or fed's selling oh i forgot the fed qt 6 and5 trillion not 5 and a half trillion silly me 6 and a5 trillion of net effective treasury issuance that is uh just over 525 billion of net effective treasury issuance per month into an economy globally that grows gdp say 90 trillion economy growing let's get aggressive let's say 4 trillion let's say it grows 4% nominal that's 3.6 trillion in growth that's going to need to address 6 and5 trillion in net effective treasury issuance uhoh not enough balance sheet what do we do we'll sell more assets okay accelerate that now it's not 6 and a half you need now it's seven uhoh you see what the problem is here so it can drive a bid for treasuries in the short run but make no mistake it would drive a deflationary spiral that continues until either the fed says stop we're doing qe again or uh you get to a situation where rates are rising in a severe recession receipts are falling and your interest expense in the us other global sovereigns goes above tax receipts in the central banks either have to stand aside and let the debt default or print the interest and once you print the interest it ain't deflationary uh so it could work but again it's like burning your furniture to stay warm uh from michael if luke was an ordinary person with his macro views and had only five to seven market finance economy screens to look at every week what would those be um i i am just an ordinary person um i just am very interested in this stuff but uh i'd like the wall street journal i would have a curated uh fin twit or x or finx or whatever we call twitter now um uh feed i'd read a lot of economic history books and then i i' probably own 10 to 20% in gold and bitcoin and then i'd have a sort of a standard diversified portfolio of stocks and short-term bonds and then i'd focus on building a business doing something that i loved and and i'd leave it at that and the last question from bert what's your favorite thing to do in your free time uh i like to spend time with mrs fft and my three boys that are uh are all young men now which is has been awesome it's been the best experience in my life uh i like to work out lift row hike um so it's uh those are the things i like to do so i appreciate everybody joining me again uh it's always very enjoyable really helps um me think and and and uh try to look at things a different way which i always love to do so at any rate if you like these updates uh check us out fft llc.com for more information about uh what we're up to and and our different product offerings and in uh our tree rings product 10 most interesting things uh brief synopsis on on what grabbed our attention about them and and whether they're making us think uh differently or similarly about various topics in the world relative to while uh to how we had been thinking about those topics before we had read those things so as always thank you for joining me and uh everybody have a great great rest of your week take [music] [music] care
"US fiscal position, inflation v. deflation, USD, financial repression, oil & gas",2021-10-11 14:11:46+00:00,17,zrEaWOhMDaI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrEaWOhMDaI,"[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke growman fft hope you are well and having a great week going to jump right into the questions as always thank you for submitting questions thanks for joining me first question is from sc you've mentioned recently that the usa runs the risk of becoming argentina with us characteristics but not like japan why argentina and not japan can you expound yeah so it's important to look at the united states versus japan from a current account basis so japan runs a surplus us runs a deficit uh from foreign from a domestic financing standpoint so the us is heavily uh at least historically foreign financed uh that that is not true for japan they domestically finance uh their own deficits their own fiscal deficits uh the net international investment position of the united states is negative 65% of gdp japan it is positive 60% of gdp uh and uh the us uh essentially provides a large portion of japan's defense for japan that is not true for the us uh we provide our own defense which has a very expensive cost to it so the reason why that layers or or shakes out as the us being uh more like argentina with us characteristics and not japan in response to a debt problem is first off uh the net international investment position japan has the option of selling its foreign assets uh it can call up washington say give me my dollar assets back and do so and finance itself for quite some time the united states has no net assets to do that with uh they can't call japan and say give me my net assets we don't have any the the net inter that means that immediately when you have a debt problem to finance right so we see the yen at 1150 and trying to break out jgb yields rising to problematic levels japan can sell treasuries buy dollars take the dollars sell the dollars by the end and they can do that to the tune of 60% of japanese gdp before they run out of money and have a full-on currency crisis the united states has no such option the option is the fed does it or it doesn't get done and if the fed does it it's going to be inflationary as we have seen um in the last several years the domestic ownership of treasuries japan can get away with deflation um they can japan can because they japan has financed their deficits from uh in internally uh they can pay basically 0% rates because they have domestic deflation so real rates are still positive the math has worked for them for a long time for america we have such a huge side of our uh given historical foreign ownership of treasuries right they 7.6 trillion of treasuries we can't pay them zero they do something else with the money so we have to uh you you can't once your debt gets that high a positive real rate drives a debt crisis um as as we're starting to see so um the us is is night and day basically in every critical respect it's 180° opposite of the japanese situation uh and that's why i think it is likely to be much more like uh argentina with us characteristics which is to say a sustained period of uh high inflation uh probably preceded by some form of of crisis uh in the in the debt markets uh but ultimately the fed is going to have to act to uh help finance the treasury uh next question from uh black rock ceo on tv this week talking about crypto he means bitcoin being a flight to quality does this strengthen your opinions on bitcoin or should we we be should we be wary of such comments by these ceos to me i i think it signifies a growing recognition amongst uh the policy maker level class if you will uh that for the first time in any of our careers anyone al lives career really the risk-free asset in the world treasuries specifically western sovereign debt more broadly has either significant inflation risk or credit risk in other words if their central banks don't print the money they will eventually in the not too distant future have credit risk uh for on their sovereign debt and on treasuries uh and what i mean by that is specific to treasuries there is a rate where us inflation or excuse me there is a rate where us interest expense goes above tax receipts where is that rate that's a $64,000 question but it ain't 15% it's probably not 133% it's probably not 10 and so given that we're already over halfway there once your interest expense is above your tax receipts and i would i would argue that entitlements are interest um interest like expense but let's just keep it very strict strict definition once your interest expense is above your tax receipts you either print the money to pay the interest or you default and so that is a dynamic where given where if central banks don't add the liquidity if the fed doesn't add the liquidity this bond market sell off isn't going to stop we've talked about this the the higher the dollar goes the more net effective selling of treasuries is going to be into the markets you see i mean beatings and duration will continue until the dollar's weakened so if you need a weaker dollar a much weaker dollar in order to not lose money in bonds and ultimately to make sure they remain nominally solvent uh then you're you should start to be looking to shift some assets to to uh uh some some money to assets that don't have counterparty risk that have that better hedge inflation risk gold bitcoin and i think the the the official class of policy makers at that level are starting to sort of see that and if you read some of the headlines and talking about the bond market some of the things we've been writing about in some of these articles uh citing some of these articles in the journal in the ft and reuters and bloomberg they're not quite there yet but they're getting they're they're getting to points these policy maker class are getting to points where it's not that far a a leap from where they're currently standing to oh my gosh the only way we can keep this western sovereign debt nomal solvent is by inflating it in which case uh you need to you need to own some gold you need to own some bitcoin i think they're getting close to seeing that uh fromb you've spoken of the bad incentives the international role of the dollar creates for us government's foreign policy if as many believe the us government needs a higher price of oil would a giant war across the middle east be welcomed by some factions in order to extend the dollar's timeline as currently structured it's i don't know that anybody wants what's happening to happen in in washington i i do think it offers cover for inflation which the fed desperately needs they desperately need a scapegoat where they can say it's not our fault uh or we're backing off on rates because it's the right thing to do for our allies in the middle east uh i i do think the us wants higher oil to keep shale production elevated uh and deep water uh production elevated but they also want lower oil to help stabilize the treasury market because again once oil gets high enough in price that it pushes us us foreign creditors that import oil china japan europe into a current account deficit position like it did last summer like it probably is right around now um above 9095 bucks uh those current account deficits have to be financed by japan by china by europe how are they financed they're financed by selling treasury bonds the treasury bonds the piggy bank all these countries own these creditor nations own they'll sell them to raise dollars to finance their debt is to defend their currencies so washington needs both a higher price of oil the energy side the strategic side uh and the immediate sort of for alarm fire in the bond market needs a lower price of oil so that's that makes it tricky because a war is inflationary uh and that's a great quote from zolan posar but b higher oil from prices from this mid east war is a likely an accelerant to the incre to to the bond market sell we're seeing in treasury markets and across bond markets so i i think i don't think anybody in washington really wants this this is pretty uh it's pretty bad time for it to be happening for washington and i think we're seeing that at the long end of the curve today and it's you know today being wednesday it's it's it's it's like i said it's likely going to continue until the us dollar is marketly weakened uh from and then the final question if china were to start a military or would rates go up or down a lot of different implications to think about such as flight to safety for assets which people would buy treasuries and also reduction of goods available for everyone which could spike inflation i i'll preface this with i think it's a i think it's an interesting thought exercise i don't think it's going to happen take that with a grain of salt i didn't think russia would in invade ukraine was totally wrong with that said rates would in the us and across the world would probably spike a lot lot the bond market across the world would probably crash uh the flight to safety and asset markets would probably be gold uh oil commodities uh probably bitcoin probably big cap stocks perhaps in the us maybe not though because wars are expensive in inflation are people are going to want their capital and their capital remember 2third of global equity market cap give or take maybe it's 55 maybe it's 60% but the majority of global equity market cap is in us equities so if there's a war where the world bifurcates and people want their capital they're going to take their money out not put it in um at least some of it maybe some of it will come but a lot of it's going to get pulled out depending on where the conflict is etc etc uh goods would also be uh likely a bid to safety because remember if you have a war with the world's factory the shortages and the inflation we saw in co will be a cute warm-up to what we see uh which is why i think the bond market across the world would crash instantly i mean remember world war ii long-term treasury yields were at 2% when japan bomb pearl harbor instantly they went to two and a half and then the fed capp them said yield curve control we not going to allow long-term bonds over 2 and a half% and that's where they stayed for the next nine years and you got paid every time you were owed and you lost a lot of money on a real basis uh stocks did well comm ities did well but again commodities are everyone loves speculating commodities in a war that's not going to people are that that becomes a threat to national security you're going to have some sort of capital controls you will have rationing copper drives rubber drives etc that kind of stuff when you're talking about major power war global power war so um some thought process on it i i think it's an interesting thought exercise i think it's important as a tail risk as something to to spend a moment thinking on but i i'm not dwelling on it um i just think it's so catastrophic that i like to think um i like to think that cooler heads would prevail maybe i'm being optimistic which is ironic since i'm sometimes called a doomer by some people at any rate as always thank you very much for

"Interest rates, The relevance of Fed Standing Repo Facility, Scenarios that would change our outlook",2021-09-27 21:22:04+00:00,16,5lKT2hlPzi4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lKT2hlPzi4,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke grahman fftt hope you are well hope you're having a great week a little bit of a midweek update here thank you first off for everybody submitting questions uh very helpful always gets my brain going really enjoy these interactions so with that i'm going to jump right in the first question from gary please discuss the yen how far it goes 152 question mark if and when the ministry of finance and bank of japan intervene and how successful or unsuccessful the intervention will be will japan have to raise rates before 2024 uh i don't know i don't have a strong feeling on it uh in terms of a level uh my view that i do have a strong feeling on is that as long as u.s deficits uh are as big as they are as long as the fed is not monetizing them either directly or indirectly via the banking system or treasuries running down tga or the different ways of dollar liquidity being injected to absorb those uh and as long as oil prices are rising uh the answer in my answer in terms of the yen is it's going lower uh they'll sell treasuries uh and repatriate japanese capital from abroad heavily u.s dollar assets in all likelihood um and that's going to keep the dollar up that's going to keep rates up that's going to keep this spiral that we're starting to see accelerate in the last week or two in terms of dollar up rates up uh risk off uh accelerate so for me the key is that there's really no breaks on this train um unless the dollar and oil are weakened markedly i think that's the key so um realistically in terms of mechanics they can play defense they the the the japan bank of japan ministry of finance they can play defense tactically um they can jawbone they can um they can they can try to raise rates i don't know that that'll help a whole lot uh other than tactically they can sell down dollar assets but ultimately uh the size of u.s deficits um and the net issuance sizes um where it's not just deficit but then also foreign selling from of treasuries from around the world to defend their currencies uh the only really sustainable way to uh weaken the dollar in my view is renewed qe or yield curve control or its equivalent here in the u.s so uh from john do you feel gold will drop to 1800 ish before the rally near term uh yeah i could uh i wouldn't be surprised about that at all actually uh it depends on on two factors in my opinion number one when does the treasury market dysfunction get bad enough to bring federal treasury back into supply liquidity and two if fed and treasury don't step in fast enough and let treasury or uh this treasury uh rates up dollar feedback loop keep driving rates up at what rate does the market begin to say the west is insolvent at a sovereign level at this rate buy me gold and it's tough to know what that rate is but it ain't that far from here in my opinion so um at that point i suspect you'll start to see you would start to see gold really separate from real rates in a way that we've started to see since 2022 and particularly the late 2022 but i think it's really gonna it would really start from that point so uh with that said in in between now and either one or two could i see gold cell down to 1800 absolutely uh am i selling it no uh i own physical uh held out of the banking system at vaults um uh in in the at cities in the region and i'm unlevered and i'm playing for the end game um i only need to be right once in my life so now i would be doing something different if i was a levered player or if i had a monthly mandate so um take that based on your own personal positioning uh from edward doesn't it make sense to sell treasuries as a foreign nation when they knew rates would rise i asked this because you mentioned them dumping them but this makes perfect sense they'll rebuy the treasuries when the rate hike hiking cycle and and in the meantime they'll buy hard assets central banks don't trade to maximize profits they already have a printing press they literally can print money if they wanted to so that's not they don't they don't uh in act in markets to try to maximize profits like most private sector actors would they man they they trade to manage their domestic currencies and their domestic economies and for political reasons so uh they're selling these these treasuries to support the currencies and to buy oil uh they're short oil they're short dollars they're selling treasuries they buy both uh they'll keep selling uh as long as the dollar rises they have to keep selling if they run out of dollar assets treasuries to sell then they have to devalue their currencies and this is the part that actually is very different this time that most market participants in my view and certainly many market participants are not factoring into their analysis it's why so many have been trying to catch the falling knife on tlt and getting their heads kicked in which is historically that's how it worked foreigners sell down dollar assets they run out and then they have to devalue their currencies restart the game uh now the u.s net international investment position is negative 70 percent seven zero percent of u.s gdp which means foreigners own 18 trillion dollars more in u.s assets than we own of theirs from 1976 to 2012 the u.s net international investment position was positive 10 of u.s gdp to negative 20 u.s gdp which meant foreigners had a small piggy bank they could sell down and then they would run out of dollar assets and then they'd have to devalue now they've got a gigantic vault of dollar assets and they will sell and they'll keep selling and they will send rates higher and higher and the dollar higher and higher and they will break treasury markets they will break you as housing markets they will break u.s banks they will break global banks they will break the global economy they'll break global system before they run out of dollar assets to sell and it's critical that people understand this um there's no breaks on this so uh the brakes are the fed and the treasury weakening the dollar resuming qe whatever you want to call it um i still like i said i still don't think this last part this net international investment position size differential is understood by enough people because if it was people wouldn't be falling all over themselves to try to back tlt like i saw a tweet today that you know tlt inflows are still massive if nothing else you would stand aside see where its level is because there is just as long as a dollar in oil arising it's just going to be a lot more selling to come of us dollar assets that's just how it is from gg i'd love to hear more about the gold premiums premiums in shanghai versus comex and what it means china weaponizing gold question mark and how you see this playing out uh to oversimplify it means gold buys more energy in china than it does in the west uh this would not matter if oil and gas were not priced in yuan if they were only priced in dollars still however they are priced anyone the russians are selling in that the iranians the venezuelans a good 25 30 of global net exports can be bought in you on now that changes everything it sets up an organic arbitrage where uh it's a real stimulus um cheaper energy drives uh faster growth which drives more gold buying in china which drives the ability to buy more cheap energy which drives more growth wash rinse repeat uh cheat everyone talks about china needs to do stimulus very few people seem to think of cheaper energy as stimulus what if i gave new england for this winter half price gas and heating oil that would be a huge stimulus for the northeastern economy people would go out and they'd have a lot more money to spend on christmas gifts china's effectively getting that not quite as dramatic in terms of the premium and it's not going to be all right away but particularly if russia goes through with what they said they're going to do which is sell gas to china at half price relative to europe beginning in january to last for three years through 2026 gold's gonna buy a whole heck of a lot more gas in china than it does in the west and as long as that happens gold and gas and growth are all going to flow to china and that's how it's going to work and so that organ you know again most of the western traders they went okay how do i have the immediate trade how do i with me and yeah there's sort of an arb there and some people are on the march the real thing here it's it's a it's a it's an organic economic stimulus slash arbitrage that will be like a slowly tightening noose it'll just slowly drain gold from the west and it'll slowly pull more energy toward china which will slowly allow china to out-compete europe and to a lesser extent the us until the u.s lets cold rise that's that's what's being set up here in my view so yeah can you explain fiscal dominance in light of the fed's balance sheet already at eight to nine trillion dollars haven't we already been dependent on the fed to cover deficits if we survived nine trillion dollars why not 20 trillion dollars and i think we will get the 20 trillion that's um on the come however the fiscals uh dominance um to simplify or oversimplify is that the fed cannot raise rates without putting the us government into a situation that requires the fed to print money in order to prevent default on entitlements defense or interest which are the big three things you can't cut uh and we're there and we've been there um and so the debt and the entitlements are so big and the economy is so financialized that higher rates sends expenses up and deficits up rapidly and receipts down rapidly so basically it just means the fed's no longer in charge of inflation the fiscal deficit is the fed's just making it worse by raising rates so that is the issue now critically when the fed is selling bonds on top of treasury to do this it leads to this dollar squeeze which is going to drive dollar up rates up until the system uh comes unhinged and that's another way you can tell we're in fiscal dominance is the deficits are so big they're crowding everything else out if that wasn't the case we wouldn't we wouldn't be seeing um what we're seeing in markets in terms of dollar in rates certainly to the extent we're seeing it and then the final question from sylvester uh what's the question you think your audience should be asking but isn't um i would say why does the net international i did a tweet last week i actually got a ton of uh a ton of interaction a ton of views highlighting that i i take any rate cycle analysis looking at the last six or seven rate hiking cycles and unless they attach the caveat that none of those rate cycles have had the net international investment position of the us this negative they've never had u.s debt this high they've never had u.s deficit the gdp this high and the us has never been the world's biggest marginal high-cost energy producer oil producer um if they don't have those caveats i i basically ignore that analysis because it's going to be flying blind um why is that the case the net international investment position i just described the debt the gdp the deficit the gdp it means you're going to get this pro cyclical dynamic um that has no brakes on it dollar up treasury yields up foreign selling interest rates up deficit up more issuance up treasury sells more dollar goes up more fed sells more foreigners sell more and there's there's just no breaks on it and then the other side of it is that as rates go up u.s oil production is ultimately a price and interest rate sensitive and will drop off first and fastest and ultimately u.s oil production on the shale side will after an initial period where it falls uh less fast than demand it will eventually fall faster than oil demand does even in a recession um and that leads to a very stagflationary dynamic which then leads to feeding back into what i just described rates up dollar up foreign selling so so there's just this very very all those factors when you combine them together lead to a very pro cyclical dynamic into an over levered system where the biggest marginal buyer treasuries in recent months have been highly levered hedge funds joseph wong on twitter has done some really good work on that former new york fed trader um in recent weeks i'd take a look at that so that's the big difference and so it's really important to understand that looking at the last six seven rate hiking cycles in the united states for guidance is going to lead you to the wrong conclusion um you need to probably be looking at rate hiking cycles in argentina and brazil uh over and call it in the 80s and 90s and kind of tamping down the extremity of the outcomes but in terms of the directional implications they have probably they're probably of more use so with that i'm going to sign off for tonight quick reminder that this week we do have uh uh upgrade cycle for our tree rings product there are bonuses you can learn more about it in the link below uh in the meantime also check us out

[music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hey everybody luke grahaman fftt hope you're well hope you had a great weekend i know it was started off a little iffy on the weather but ended up being a beautiful weekend and very nice day yesterday hopefully it was nice for you as well so with that thank you for joining me i'm going to jump right into the questions thank you for submitting them always great to see them and think about them it's very helpful so thank you so with the uh for the first question uh gary please comment on the significance and policy implications of comments by bank of japan governor kazoo awaited today today excuse me is it simple job owning or does it imply near-term policy changes uh i don't know uh if it's just job boning or if it is near-term policy changes i do think it implies an increasing level of discomfort i won't go all the way to panic but discomfort amongst western policy makers uh regarding what is happening in global sovereign bond markets and in global currency markets in this case the yen against the dollar and the weakness ultimately whether it's jaw boning or actual policy change it'll likely put more upward pressure on global capital costs in other words yields up in treasuries eu japan basically regardless of what inflation's doing keep in mind this concept this net international investment position concept we've been discussing and hammering on it continues to be uh not focused on enough by most market participants as best we can tell whether it's jaw boning or an actual policy change certainly the widening of of jgb 10-year jgb yield curve control band a little over a month ago was a policy change it is japan saying we are going to repatriate japanese capital from abroad to finance more of our fiscal deficits and or defend our currency uh with japanese net international investment position at a positive roughly 60 percent of of gdp last time i checked this amounts to a piggy bank of 60 percent of japanese gdp that can be repatriated back to japan to buy them time the by them doing this this basically throws the problem onto the lap of the fed immediately uh in the form of higher treasure yields despite whatever else may be happening disinflation deflation etc so let's watch and see what it actually amounts to but directionally it is further repatriation of japanese capital from abroad uh quite possibly uh from frank will the u.s eventually have to cut entitlements as predicted by stan druckenmiller in my opinion yes the key questions how uh will they cut them on a real basis where we have high sustained inflation um which i think is probably the most likely way of doing it basically you get 10 to 15 percent cpi actual inflation and you get the cost of living adjustment for uh entitlements to be five or six and you do that long enough and you can sort of reduce the real value of those obligations uh can you do it on a nominal basis that's the second possible way where you just go to the baby boomers and say sorry we're gonna have to cut your benefits by 30 40 percent which i think is around the number that drucken miller has talked about as needed immediately uh it's possible maybe you can do some phasing uh based on income levels right so means testing for higher income beneficiaries and you cut them 80 90 100 percent and you you keep it for the more uh uh the the people who need it more uh any way you slice it that is a very politically uh fraught dynamic no matter how you handle it and in an election year i just don't think it is going to be uh possible so for at least the next 18 months i don't think that a nominal cut to entitlements is is possible uh there's one other way that nobody wants to talk about um it's not something i'm rooting for but as an objective analyst i need to keep an eye out on the data to see if it's happening and that is if uh some good percentage of the sickest baby boomers who when you look at the data account for a very disproportionate uh quorum of overall entitlement costs if they pass on relatively quickly as a cohort over the next two three four four years five years that fixes a big part of the entitlement problem that is a cut to entitlements no one wants to think about it that way i don't even like talking about it i'm certainly not rooting for it but again as an objective analyst i need to keep an eye out for it we all need to keep an eye out for it because it would represent a de facto productivity miracle you would significantly reduce the us government's outlay on entitlements and you would also actually pass on uh that cohort of boomers wealth whatever exists onto their kids who are in their higher spending years of life just based on demographics so you will go from a big fiscal drag being removed and a gdp accelerant accelerated by virtue of the well wealth of that cohort being passed on to their kids and spent into the economy so again i am not rooting for it i'm also cognizant of the dynamics i'm watching for them for them i'm not seeing them yet but we'll see going forward from david c will the guard lose control of the spread between german boots and u.s treasuries now the german industrial output is faltering how does the ecb cope with the exodus of capital across the pond as powell stays higher for longer uh i don't know but you use in a tough spot uh it's been the biggest surprise to me over the last 18 months uh how much the leadership of the eu has acted against the interest of the eu at the behest of u.s policy makers uh it is now resulting in the severe de-industrialization of europe energy costs are going to be non-competitive and that assumes the u.s does not cut energy costs lng exports to the europeans sometime over the next year where if inflation picks back up here re-accelerates here energy inflation in particular i am not convinced that the u.s administration in an election year will continue to ship energy to the europeans in the quantities promised at the costs promised um if doing so increases inflation here in an election year and so i i don't understand the game the eu is playing um now the capital repatriation is a little tricky on one level you are seeing industrial capital move here from there based on energy costs etc on the other hand germany has been running surpluses for a long time and there are they are subject to the same net international investment position where they likely have dollar assets sitting here they can repatriate that would go in the other direction um i don't know how those things net out i apologize so that's one of the things where probably need to look into a bit more to see what is germany's net international investment position and what does that look like can they start repatriating which again would simply increase global capital costs throw the problem back onto the lap of the fed increasing treasury yields almost regardless of what's happening with inflation in the economy uh which simply makes the instabilities we've been seeing over the last 18 months more unstable uh next question from bert if the brics countries go back to some form of gold back currency will countries like saudi arabia accept the dollar or euros payment do they insist on paying or do they insist on being paid in gold i don't think the bricks are going to a gold-backed currency uh as it were i think what they're doing and is they are switching to more local currency transactions particularly around energy and other commodities uh and then any net surpluses that exist uh at first if there are imbalances that build in a local currency those local currency surpluses which will tend to be amongst the energy exporters the commodity exporters in the group can then be recycled into the production of the energy importing net creditors factories of the world like china so if saudi ends up with yuan in their books at some point like the russians have ended up with you you want on their books the russians can recycle those you want into chinese goods as could the saudis and then whatever is left over will be net recycled into gold at a floating rate in all currencies and as a practical matter quite possibly at a higher gold oil ratio than the paper markets a gold paper market set gold to oil ratio we see in london and new york which is a practical matter would mean that a lot of that gold for settlement for bricks local currency trade net surpluses would be coming from the west so that's what i think that system is evolving to not an explicit goldback currency because nobody wants those kind of handcuffs on them they just want a reserve asset that won't collapse over time against oil and against other commodities which is what treasuries boons jgbs all global sovereign debt is highly likely to do in coming years gold won't collapse against commodities gold will maintain purchasing power in commodities as it has for well over a century unlike all western sovereign debt and finally from mark what is your view regarding liquidity and equity slash bitcoin how close is the correlation what measure of liquidity do you use for me bitcoin remains the last functioning smoke alarm uh in terms of a measure of liquidity a lot of other markets are uh shall we say managed um for various political reasons not to say bitcoin is completely uh unmanaged i think there are certainly forces that would like to try to manage it but i think it's a cleaner market than than almost all other markets at this point still and so for me um it has a message for liquidity now what is liquidity i think it's multi-pronged if you will um higher oil prices drain liquidity higher dollar drains liquidity and vice versa higher treasury general account so if the treasury is building up the tga drains liquidity vice versa um higher rates all else equal drains it uh sort of but remember we've been highlighting this dynamic um with the really inspired by work by charles kyla myris and by uh warren mosler higher rates with debt to gdp this high aren't as unstimulative as they used to be as time goes on they start creating interest stimmy so higher rates kind of drain it it becomes a netting game right so initially uh higher rates uh probably do drain it a little bit on net but the longer it goes on and the more they go the more there's an interest rate stimulus two wealthy asset holders and when you net that against the deficit stimulus of that against the fiscal deficit stimulus of that against the private sector curtailment of activity from those higher rates i think we're getting to a point where it's net stimulative actually on higher rates so i also like watching the move treasury index volatility it hasn't returned to highs the dollar as measured by dxy is also a good liquidity indicator uh when factored in with sort of all these other factors and there's some firms that do a really good job of looking at liquidity annual cross-border capital michael howell has a pretty active twitter feed and a research service looking exactly uh at liquidity in great depth he does a really nice job so with that i'm going to

"QE Taper thoughts, BTC, Real Rates, & Gold Prices",2021-08-24 13:00:06+00:00,18,7ouIC8yXUIo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ouIC8yXUIo,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hi this is luke grahman from fftt hope you are well hope you had a great weekend the weather here was beautiful we're getting into those late summer days a little bit a little bit earlier sunsets cooler nights one of my favorite times of year so hope you had a great weekend let's jump into the questions thank you as always for submitting them a very thought-provoking really enjoy it so really appreciate getting to do these interactions so i'm going to jump right in first question is from paul you recently tweeted about a trade-off between the strategies or options of the u.s treasury and the u.s department of defense if i got it correct can you discuss that further or correct me if if i'm wrong no you you've got it right there are trade-offs and uh what what i was tweeting about is that we can either have a strong dollar or we can have a robust defense industrial base we can't do both uh treasury wants the strong dollar uh to fund uh debt and past deficits um strong dollar is good for wall street it is good for those people in the treasury export business historically which is washington dc uh and it's bad for the for the uh the middle working class and the u.s defense industrial production base and so uh the department of defense is flagging uh increasingly vocally that the 40 years of strong dollar have hollowed out the u.s defense industrial base to such an extent that uh we cannot go to war uh without china and the components that china makes and the problem of course versus if our number one strategic competitor is china that is a reason you can see very obviously why the department of defense um wants to reassure and reassuring the defense industrial base full stop will require a weaker dollar um basically defense industrial policy uh fed would need to either engage in yield curve control or print the deficits whatever government spends the money and um the fed's gonna have to buy it uh you basically have to run an inflationary industrial policy if you want to reassure the defense industrial of base such that you are not dependent on the dod is not dependent on china uh in supply chains to the extent that it is um and that's that fundamental tension is something that i think is still very underappreciated in financial markets so that's what i was tweeting about now from sfd in your oil to gold ratio idea with 60 barrels for one ounce and that's something i've talked about before it's also something zoltan pozar has has has talked about um i understand how russia china and india would sign up for this but i don't understand why saudi would could you explain the opec part of this idea thank you this is a really important concept the reason why opec would go along is because once peak cheap oil hits and it with shale rolling over it is i would argue share the existence of shale means peak cheap oil era is here but once shale rolls over in particular uh in terms of production uh in an era of high debt uh oil prices will rise on average faster than the rate on debt that the u.s government can afford to pay without going bankrupt in other words real rates on u.s debt will be negative relative to the rate of inflation on oil on average uh and so then your opec or saudi choice is cell oil for treasuries essentially to oversimplify uh whose value treasuries whose value falls versus oil over time and so basically you're going to have opec run down the oil uh production uh swap it for paper whose interest rate doesn't cover the rate of growth of oil inflation and once their oil production depletes then the paper that they hold in return for producing oil in the past will absolutely collapse against oil prices right let's say saudi gawr the oil field goes down 5 million barrels a day uh goes 100 water cut production collapses by some problem you're going to take 5 million barrels a day off the oil market instantly oil is not going to 90 or 100 or 110 it's going to 150. it's going to 200 it's going to 250. and and when oil does that in that scenario that is the treasury portfolio of the former gulf nations collapsing against oil so as their oil production peaks as we go into peak cheap oil then they need to switch to a neutral reserve asset some asset that is not paper that has an energy component that has no counterparty risk and whose face value can rise with the price of oil to maintain their uh the purchasing power of their reserves their fx reserves the stuff they earn uh the surpluses they earn from selling oil that maintains the purchasing power of their reserves in real terms in oil terms and that's only goal and so basically what i'm saying is is that there is a point where saudi and opec they all know the gigs up it's a mathematical cerny peachy boil and the debt back system that we have with debt as high as it is they don't mix you have to make a switch to a neutral reserve asset with gold that's why they wouldn't do it and i also suspect they've got plenty of gold that we just don't know about from as how do you think the widening gap between long-end developed market interest rates and gold resolves itself in the coming months i think it resolves itself via a crisis possibly an interest rate crisis and then i think it resolves itself with more developing market uh qe and yield curve control up up to yield curve control i should say i don't know that they go right to it i think they desperately want to avoid yield curve control in the uk europe and u.s uh from oscar uh precious metals the moving average 50 50 day 200-day death cross is approaching in the gold graph are we about to fall off a cliff i don't think we're about to fall off a cliff uh do i think you could see gold trade into the low 1800s um in a in a in a crisis sure um to be blunt i don't care uh i'm not levered i i don't think anyone should own gold levered or in paper form i think they should all go bullied um and i think as i've repeatedly said in this environment where we are in peak cheap oil we are in a global sovereign debt that bubble that is bursting um i i think trying to trade and time things will be extremely difficult for almost uh for really most investors uh trying to trade gold to make a few bucks up and down will be extremely tricky i would rather just own it unlevered and then you know go to the beach and wait for the end game uh i that was is pro i would prefer uh to play it metaphorically or or literally so uh from roland luke what difference does it make if the fed pivots or not if the government's going to deficit spend anyway deficit spending is going to surge inflation rates will correspondingly do so as well uh ultimately it comes down to what the dollar does and what rates do in my view um if the fed and treasury the federal treasury pivot you get a weaker dollar it is inflationary it's good for asset prices um uh it's good for global growth it's good for emerging markets if you don't get a fed or treasury pivot of sorts uh then the deficit spending uh drives rates up drives dollar up and and drives a global crisis that feeds on itself as we're seeing do now right that the i think the game plan is choke out the world force the capital back here by raising rates uh i don't think people are appropriately waiting what is likely to happen which is as i've said foreigners own 7.5 trillion dollars in treasuries in aggregate and they can and will sell them to raise dollars if the dollar rises on them and starts to squeeze them they're not doing it out of a position of strength doesn't matter if you're long treasuries and they're dumping them to raise dollars uh from mark your recent interview with ameritrade did not mention the lag effects of rate hikes regarding powell at j jackson hole if he doesn't raise rates oil prices will rise and hence inflation but you didn't say anything about the impact of the lagged effect of the hikes on the economy why uh i was very focused on the lag impacts of energy as it relates to that so uh u.s shale production would fall at about a 25 to 30 percent annualized clip smooth very front unloaded if they just stopped producing that's just the geology of how it works global oil demand fell four percent annually in 1980 in a very severe recession in uh it fell eight percent annually in 2020 when we basically shut down the global economy those were the two worst declines in oil demand oil consumption globally going back 70 years shale has been around 90 percent of global oil production growth over the past decade so what i'm saying here what consensus does not appear to understand beyond the very short term powell's hikes when paired with the spr release is the biden administration is engaged in over the last 16 to 18 months they will cause oil supplies to fall much faster than oil demand will sustainably fall in a recession and so oil prices are likely to be sticky surprisingly and sort of anything other than a collapse scenario or a shutdown scenario um and and in fact will probably rise because once supply starts falling faster the demand prices go up so to me powell's this points to powell's victory quote unquote against inflation to me it all but guarantees that powell's victory against inflation will be a pyrrhic victory barring an energy productivity miracle because he chose the wrong strategy you needed to inflate you need to inflate for longer you need to inflate long enough that u.s oil production ramped up and that you brought oil prices down with a big bolus of new oil production in the united states not by virtue of running down the spr and raising rates that was a short-term pennywise pound foolish strategy and we are now into the pound foolish strategy or a pound foolish part of that movie and then finally from john luke can you provide some current numbers that point to impending balance of payments problem related doom like tax receipts versus interest or interest like expenses deficits versus global gdp growth etc sure uh so let's start with a couple uh u.s deficit eight percent of gdp we cut deficits just back to two so it means we need to cut six points of gdp of spending instantly that means gdp goes down six percent okay great in the great financial crisis gdp fell like three or four on an annualized basis it was enough to nearly bring down the system in 2020 gdp fell if i'm not mistaken four or six seven percent on an annualized basis with the economy shut down it would have been enough to nearly bring down the system required massive stimulus and massive what was it 600 billion a week in qe at one point um you can't cut six points at gdp without crashing the system okay so that's that's number one number two trailing three-month tax receipts down 20 percent year over year through may uh that's only happened a few other times in history uh one q09 2q uh o2 uh and then i think right around 9 11. so every time in recessions now california some timing stuff there even if you assume california um if you normalize for california you're still probably down eight to ten percent you're over here in tax receipts uh fiscal first half of this year so that is 4q22 1q23 calendar uh u.s true interest expense in the fiscal one-half was above treasury receipts already before the big drop off in tax receipts in april and may and before the major reset and interest expense goes higher and so after just six months of interest rate hikes u.s government receipts were not covering interest expense on a full year basis so either the us government defaults on entitlements and treasury spending or rates rise globally to attract the capital which again is only going to touch off the debt spiral foreigners have seven and a half trillion to sell dollar goes up they sell more treasuries to get dollars uh rates go up interest expense goes up deficits go up receipts go down dollar goes up more foreigners sell more treasuries wash rinse repeats so again we've already crossed the rubicon here treasury receipts being below true interest expense uh i i don't to me buying long-term debt of a country who can't cover their true interest expense unless the central bank prints it that is that is a tray that is picking up pennies in front of a steamroller i i don't think you do well over time buying the long-term sovereign debt of countries who can't cover their true interest expense out of tax receipts at least not doing well on a real basis you might do fine if the government of the fed turns into a yield curve control so that is just some of the uh dynamics why i think we are in the um while we're getting down to brass tax as they say in terms of the global sovereign debt crisis that we've been describing in real time all these uh all these quarters and years so with that i'm gonna jump for today as always thank you very much for joining me if you want more information about our different product offerings if you like these updates

"Potential Fed tightening into stagflation impacts, BTC, political and economic volatility",2021-08-10 13:00:06+00:00,16,CO5FXkGNTm8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO5FXkGNTm8,[music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hi everybody luke groman fftt hope you're well hope you had a great weekend i know we did here beautiful weather so it's getting into the transition to late summer so beautiful long days they're shortening up a little bit so hope you're making the most of it i know we are so with that i'm going to jump in thank you as always for submitting questions really appreciate it really helps me learn a lot helps me think about things differently so i really appreciate you the few questions here first from dean with interest rates having risen at such an unprecedented rate of change so high so fast why is it that we aren't seeing bigger things than some regional banks breaking in credit markets uh i think it's partly a function of timing uh from what i've seen a lot of the u.s corporate sector has locked in refinanced termed out they're dead over the last several years uh households and i'll in in mortgages in particular have uh in in the us in particular have locked in uh for long rates at fixed rates are uh for long terms at fixed rates excuse me uh banks we've seen they've struggled a bit but here too we've had the fed with some of their facilities uh ease that strains uh that stress u.s debt ceiling i think curtailed the amount of issuance uh in the second quarter uh we're starting to see that resume now especially with yesterday's monstrous uh 3q and 4q treasury issuance numbers that they just laid out so that may destabilize things a bit uh we still have commercial real estate i think uh resets largely on the come so that's i also refer to in terms of timing and then i think critically this fiscal dominance concept that uh myself and a number of others have been increasingly highlighting as we've moved through this year uh there is a tipping point that you reach with debt and deficit levels is high where raising rates starts to become stimulative rather than uh contractive so i think we're already on the wrong side of that in other words i think we're already in fiscal dominance so the bigger us deficits get that's going to increasingly offset the uh uh restrictive implications or restrictive impacts of fed policy uh the other the other issues that with debt levels is high the you get very binary outcomes if we wanted if the fed wanted to stop inflation get it back to their targets right away uh remember i've been saying for a while they're not operating at dial they're operating a switch because there's so much leverage in the system uh the fed could have stood aside in march they could have said unsecured uh depositors uh lose all their money um venture capital firms with a couple billion in deposits uh unguaranteed uninsured uh sorry you lose that money uh yes you need to wind down your investments yes you need to lay off people yes your companies need to close so on so forth or have that ripple through the economy uh the fed did not do that and by definition uh that's inflationary uh the other the we had a deflationary or inflation they wanted two options there's so no middle ground with leverages high and they chose inflation so uh the final part on timing is that the fuse on government borrowing in particular u.s government borrowing and the impacts of a debt issue credit issue or far longer and like i just said these these massive new borrowing estimates for 3q and 4q of this year calendar 3q and 4q may uh start to reintroduce some uh instability going forward so let's let's watch and see uh from james i really like your points recently on a guest spot you did about how logically the outcome of today's current financial environment is a choice in the u.s at least depression versus inflation and that inflation is the obvious choice those in power will make do you see this being more regional domestic global etc or pretty ubiquitous all of your advice about being unleveraged with cash on the sidelines in golden bitcoin is that for some prospective plunge and asset prices which is then followed by runaway inflation in which you buy things are crashing barring an energy productivity miracle i think we're likely to see a global secular high rate of inflation i don't think it's necessarily runaway inflation but that is actually on the on the uh menu of options depending on what policy makers do and what happens with events uh just given the situation but it's it's not my base case of runaway inflation but i do think secular much higher inflation than people are used to that is my base case i think the effects and the reason i think that let me say is because the post 71 dollar system is a global system and the issue is with the dollar system if you have a dollar inflation you're gonna have inflation everywhere now the effects of that inflation i think will vary regionally and and can be oversimplified down to commodity exporters and industrial output will close the wealth and income gap with financial assets uh and and financial debtors um yes in terms of why do i the cash on the sidelines and recommend uh being unlevered on on holdings uh i've got high the reason i i say that is i've got high conviction i have high conviction in the end game how this plays out i have extremely low conviction in the path between here and there and the pathway from here to there is extremely political so uh an extremely political situation can be an extremely irrational situation and so i don't want to be levered i don't want to be over my skis too far um when i'm reliant on politicians to be rational to do so so uh from gary blake david and a couple others um please talk about the macro implications of the japanese adjustment to yield curve control what did they really change and what is it and does it matter if they're already back to buying bonds aggressively uh at higher yields what does it mean for u.s markets specifically uh all else equal to me it repatriates japanese capital globally back to japan and raises the global cost of capital or yields for global bond markets um that japan already was back in buying some tells me uh to basically manage the rate at which yields go up uh to me is a is a sign of how fragile uh the entire system is how untenable the whole situation is and and a symptom of how fast policymakers will react um uh so there's there's still some of those saying well i'm just gonna to me it speaks to the point of needing to be there not be all in cash not be because people say i'll be all in cash i'll be all conservative and i'll i'll move when they move they they policy makers are showing repeatedly to be proactive to be aggressive to respond very very fast so i think that is important to factor into calculus as we're thinking about just our allocations ahead of any potential issues in terms of japan buying the only thing i'll say i think i like i said i think it's a manage i'll say two things i think it's a managing of the of rates higher number one but i historically japan buying pots has been good for global liquidity so there's a little bit of a yin and a yang right in terms of if japan's managing the process by injecting more liquidity it's good for liquidity but all else equal the fact that they are widening it out that yields a rising there raises the cost of capital and yields around the world which is bad for liquidity so ultimately i think it's a bit of a destabilizing factor from a period of relative stability over the last several months now from vinnie could the recent superconductor discovery be possibly be one of the energy miracles you refer to how would this affect your theory even if commercialization is three to five years out uh yes if this is what it says it is absolutely it could be an energy productivity miracle with that said the commercialization if it's three to five years out that's too long it's they're not going to make it in time uh it's not going to arrive in time before the us needs to resume qe or yield curve control uh to meteorite fiscal problems um it needs to be commercialized way sooner if it is to have the effect to completely force me to change my my views on the acute the acuteness of the u.s and western fiscal strains um i think it also raises other issues um we saw that china i guess today china the news is china replicated the experiment if i read it correctly if that's the case uh what does it do to geopolitical balances of power if china is able to have this as fast as or faster than the us um am i to trust videos i see out of china because doing so in the last three years has not always been a good course of action to take and i'll leave it at that um you know what does it do to global power dynamics so uh it it taken at face value at the fastest possible commercialization it would force me to completely rethink uh the fiscal strains anything less than that and in particular the timing uh it's not going to arrive in time so let's let's watch and see the timing and how things develop on it from here but it could absolutely be a game changer not from stephen you mentioned quite a while ago that maybe the fed rate increases were to crush the world but you couldn't seem to square that circle because a global recession would hurt the us as well but with how things have progressed it looks like global weakness is driving capital to the u.s and nobody seems to care that the rate increases have blown the lid off the deficit so do you think the fed might just keep raising rates to keep crushing the world which might lessen the energy squeeze to keep attracting capital to the u.s i agree that net capital that on net capital has flowed to the us and that nobody seems to care about the deficit yet but keep in mind we just had a debt ceiling where there was no issuance um and i think we might have just taken the lid off of that pandora's box with this issuance number for 3q4q these numbers are enormous uh i think they'll probably be destabilizing uh i think the bigger issue too is this gambit that the u.s ran uh had a finite shelf life the gambit was raise rates and released the spr get oil down get inflation down get the dollar up get rates up and the bet was basically the that russia and china will break before u.s allies and the u.s banking system and u.s shale production rolled over fast forward to today we saw the uk guilt market have its issues in the 3-q uh 3q 22. we saw the u.s banks have their issue in one q23 and the fed have to respond and now we're seeing us shale production rollover um if the u.s keeps hiking u.s shale will roll over hard and if it rolls over hard u.s loses control of inflation they lose control of energy they lose they basically seed control of energy markets to russia and to uh saudi if you lose control of energy you lose control of inflation you lose control of inflation you lose control of rates um and then you're going to start seeing capital move out of the u.s into commodities and we don't do so well when capitals of the commodities we we like negative real rate tech things we do really well when capitals flowing into that bonds tech uh when commodities are surging money is going to be out of bonds and out of tech into commodities and then we're going to be in a bit of a pickle because we've already run down the spr shale having peaked will be several years incoming until it can resume prior highs so when it is too too early to say that the gambit worked in fact the gambit had a finite shelf life and it's looking like it worked for that finite shelf a finite shelf life but it now looks like uh that finite shelf life is ending uh from ff how would gold asset settlement work under bricks and beyond with a lack of counterparty trust brett woods blew apart when the gold pool failed and then usa defaulted on delivery how do you envision enforcement working here uh pretty straightforward no gold no oil in other words you miss a gold delivery to a russia and iran a saudi uh the next oil delivery doesn't come and you can deal with the consequences of oil shortages gasoline shortages economic disruption political disruption etc so you better get the gold there so uh i think that's how it will work um you know we spend a lot of energy in this country shuttling uh bottled water back and forth um i i think you'll see i didn't get i don't think it's a stretch to see a system where you'll see energy expended uh to shuttle gold back and forth at least on an intermediate basis uh maybe it's every quarter maybe it's every month after world war ii the us was sending a gold discs minted specifically for the saudis it has payment for oil so um i think that's where this is going um at some point and probably not too far down the road and then the final question from np what are your thoughts on europe getting hit left right and center does not look good from an energy an industry and supply chains perspective second derivative problem means does not a second derivative probably means it does not look good for the u.s and global rules-based order are you getting worried i'm not i wouldn't say worried uh i would say surprised i've been probably one of the biggest surprises to me over the last 18 months has been how europe has been essentially willing to commit economic suicide uh to respond to the ukrainian situation i would also say to the extent the u.s policy makers have encouraged europe to take these actions uh it is short-sighted in my view from u.s policy makers um your your closest allies the uk the uh the eu excuse me um are getting hurt worse than russia or china are um and that seems like a strange strategy to me um it would be akin to you know if we keep if we are to take it face value take that with a great assault if we're to take it face value u.s policy admonitions that putin or she or like hitler or whatever uh pre-world war ii then what we just did over the last 18 months was akin to bombing the uk and france in 1940 uh to soften them up for hitler so i i i the whole strategy to me of the last 18 months was very much uh in line with that finite life gambit i referred to earlier there was basically a short-term policy set rolled out they had a finite life and the the gambit was basically russia and china would fold before that gambit ran out of shelf life and across the board it looks like russia and china have not folded before we've run out of shelf life on that gambit and that means uh don't be surprised if you see oil prices rise potentially meaningfully in the second half of this year with very limited western ability to do much about it and then if we have a cold winter in europe katie bar the door things could get really ugly so let's watch and see in the meantime that's it for today i appreciate everyone joining me as always if you like these updates check out fftt llc.com for more information about what we're up to more information about our tree rings product 10 most interesting things brief synopsis on what grabbed our attention about them whether they confirmed or refuted away we'd previously been thinking about the world get a lot of great feedback on it and as always everybody great week i look forward to chat with you soon take care everyone [music]
"Peak Cheap Oil, Potential catalysts for Fed getting more dovish, Path dependency differences",2021-07-27 13:00:15+00:00,14,hAZBBp4nq3M,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAZBBp4nq3M,[music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fftt hope you are well hope you had a great weekend i know of weather around here was beautiful hope it was near you as well i'm going to jump right in thanks as always for submitting questions really appreciate it i always learn a lot from just uh the questions and and so i really appreciate you responding to the tweets and with that let's jump right in first off a lot of questions about the potential brics currency that may or may not be announced at the upcoming bricks meeting early in august uh to me the most interesting thing maybe thus far about it is that yellen when asked about it didn't say it isn't happening and it'll never happen and when she was asked about it she cited basically that it the the the currency project in question maybe it's a faux pawn her part uh in the way she answered it and certainly uh in recent media appearances uh in my opinion most notably back when she was asked about the banking stuff and deposit insurance back in march i guess it was uh she's had a few of those so maybe that was it but to me that she did not come right out and say it's not happening it isn't going to happen it isn't going to work i took as a sign that she knows something is coming um and that she doesn't want to look foolish in a few weeks when it does come out having just said it isn't going to be coming out um in in in less than one full news cycle so i i think it's a sign that they know something is coming now will it matter uh i think that depends on construction and and uh etc there's a lot of different factors but let's just leave it at construction ultimately in my opinion uh a tie between gold and energy that is produced within the brics block uh and consumed within the bricks block is far more likely far more important far more interesting than any tie between the the various fiat currencies within the brics and gold and that's what most people seem to be focused on i think that's a mistake i think the key is the relationship between gold and energy in a particular oil and in particular the relative prices between the two zoltan poes are talked about it we've talked about it where if you rewrite the price of gold in barrels of oil which they could do free markets will do the rest we've seen how fungible oil is we've tried to cut russian oil off since last year it's still flowing just fine so uh that to me the gold energy relationship i think is much more interesting than any ghoul potential gold fiat relationship what do i make of news that india is backing out of it that came out either today or yesterday maybe a couple days ago uh here too it depends too early to tell is india really backing out or is this the another case of russia is collapsing into civil war from a couple weekends ago or before that putin is going to be dead of cancer within a few months from early last year point is is as i just don't know and i don't think anybody knows so there's a lot of fog of currency war around all of this which makes sense because these are really big issues uh in my opinion we are nearing a major turning point in the global monetary system global monetary history one way or another the reason i say that is because we are in peak cheap energy peak jeep oil i think that's undeniable based on the geology based on things we've talked about before and peak jeep energy is fundamentally incompatible with the current debt-backed monetary system uh as its structure and so unless there's an energy productivity miracle as we've said over and over the existing monetary system is going to change i heard it's going to change um via action or it's going to change via collapsing into something else so that's the thoughts as we sit here today on monday night as it relates to the brics currency uh developments that have come to the forefront in recent days and weeks the next question is from brennan what happens to oil if you want devalues it's a good question i think it goes take a step back under uh the system where oil was only priced in dollars uh if you devalued the yuan uh then oil would go up and you won uh supply demand 101 would tell you that chinese oil consumption would go down as prices went up in yuan uh global oil demand then would go down given that china is the world's biggest importer of oil and therefore oil prices would likely go down so uh that's how it has always worked um up until at least 2018. now 2018 shanghai gold or oil contract is rolled out um with increasing amounts of yuan denominated oil from russia and elsewhere if china wants to stimulate their economy uh devaluing the one versus the dollar is no longer the only lever why why do they want to devalue the u1 versus the dollar when increasing the yuan against oil uh strengthening muon against oil would stimulate their economy on a real basis right you make energy cheaper you're actually going to stimulate your economy on a real basis not just via inflation which is what you do by devaluing the yuan versus the dollar now you want oil in this whole process means that gold's the reference point no longer the dollar so uh most most investors seem to be waiting for most is maybe too strong many investors seem to be waiting for china to devalue the yuan versus the dollar to stimulate they're not considering that yuan oil uh which is a thing could be used to devalue oil versus the yuan which can be done by increasing the gold to oil ratio in china which tells me the play here might not be salva you want against the dollar the play might be buy gold rather than sell you on or sell oil so hopefully that helps share some of the thought process it's not definitive but that's i think it's important to understand that the world has changed it's no longer just oil in dollars and because of that because oil is available in yuan that changes the calculus potentially in some very important ways that we just talked about the next question from rf what's your go forward view on one total global liquidity and two relative strength of the dollar uh total global liquidity up us dollar down um look at that i can i can actually say something quickly uh why do i think that uh simple because that is what needs to happen for the us government not to have a funding crisis in coming quarters uh dollar down equals inflation up equals tax receipts up uh equals nominal and that allows nominal gdp to stay above rates full stop nominal gdp goes below interest rates with debt to gdp at 125 percent in deficits at seven percent of gdp at the peak of the economic cycle katie bar the door it's over so you go into a debt dust spiral you go into rates up gdp down rates up gdp down it's a bad situation they got to keep nominal gdp up how do you get nominal gdp up above rates given where we are in the in the cycle you got to get the dollar down you got to get liquidity up it's it's a little bit of two sides of the same coin you get the dollar down liquidity will go up from br why do you think it has been okay to start talking about the cracks in the dollar system i.e yelling in china talking about the eventual demise as well as powell sam the us could lose reserve status i think we are a long way off from this but why are they talking about it now i think it's probably mostly politics particularly in the case of powell uh to try to scare congress into cutting spending uh in the case of yellen uh it's probably some politics as well uh a weaker dollar helps her for the reasons i just highlighted that you got to get the dollar down to get inflation up to get tax receipts up so that she doesn't have a funding problem i think it's also partly as i noted before she's probably getting briefings on this stuff and she probably knows it's coming in some way shape or form will it be successful who knows there's ways it could be made very successful particularly as i noted before if you bring gold in and tie gold at a higher gold allele ratio to energy not to fiat to energy so as a result i think she probably can't ignore it and for out of out of nothing else the fear of looking silly if it does come out so that's why i think i think it's a signpost on timing this was stuff that five years ago they didn't even bother answering uh you got laughed at for even asking it so i think there's some there there's there's some uh um informational value just in that and then the final question from db cooper hi luke you expected a fed pivot in 2022 now that hasn't happened are you still expecting one in 2023 uh i expected a fed pivot uh i didn't get a fed pivot you know what we got we got a treasury pivot last year in the third quarter in september um dollar fell at 11 and a quarter 40 annual rate uh in the fourth quarter after it had rallied 2q and 3q uh and as i just noted you get the dollar down that is functionally distinguishable indistinguishable uh in terms of liquidity uh to a fed cut uh so i would also argue that you know you got the btfp and 1q23 in response to the bank crisis i think that was a soft fed pivot um the fed certainly had the opportunity to stand aside and let the banking system go it didn't they basically implemented yield curve control for banks that's a soft form of of qe soft form of yield curve control so i expect more liquidity to continue uh incrementally from here uh i think treasury buyback program that is said to start for in 2024 likely to be a part of that so um db cooper wherever you are haven't jumped out of that airplane in the 70s with a whole bunch of money and never found hopefully you're uh you're living it up out there at any rate so uh with that i'm gonna sign off for tonight as always if you uh like these updates check out fftt lc.com for more information about what we're up to and our tree rings product the 10 most interesting things a brief synopsis about what grabbed our attention about them and whether it refutes or supports a way we'd been previously thinking about the world so thank you as always for joining me i'm gonna go watch the home run derby and uh hopefully you have a great night and we'll talk with you soon take care everybody foreign [music]
"US debt/fiscal position, initial thoughts on Basel 3 gold NSFR carve-outs for LBMA",2021-07-13 13:00:33+00:00,16,ijmBc3kM6Ec,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijmBc3kM6Ec,[music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke graham and fftt hope you are well hope you had a great weekend and it was a beautiful one here in cleveland particularly after uh after early saturday it got much nicer so nice warm day yesterday and off to a good start so far this week so with that i'm going to jump right in thanks for being here thanks for uh the questions you submitted i'm going to run through a number of them so with that first questions from david what are your thoughts on the macro implications of this weekend's drama in russia i know it's a question a lot of people have been focused on it was definitely something i was watching with great interest this weekend my answer is that it's too soon to tell i think we're gonna know more in coming weeks months how it shakes out uh to me uh it's just too soon to tell so as as i like to say let's watch uh from russell what data set are you using to track the increase or decrease in liquidity uh i the one that is a broad construct but it's fed it's a net liquidity metric right so it's the fed's balance sheet minus the reverse repo balance minus the tga balance then you consider whether oil is moving up or down uh you consider uh whether the dollar is moving up or down if oil is moving down it adds some liquidity if the dollar is moving down it adds to liquidity uh that it's all a you know that is that is is is um my construct i mean i look at other assets as well right so you can look at what cross-currency bases are doing you can look at what the dxy is doing the dollar the absolute level you can look at bitcoin there's a number of things i kind of watch all together it's it's not scientific uh really there are services i know michael howell's cross-border capital does a really nice job with measuring liquidity he's been spending a lot of time in his career doing that so but that's those are the metrics that i use and watch uh from sc do you see that the global south economic cycle will continue to diverge from the west's problems with debt etc and start to be increasingly discorrelated economically uh in my view not until the global south changes uh the monetary system to one that is multi-currency pricing of commodities with net settlement and gold good settlement net gold settlement or net neutral reserve asset settlement they're moving in that direction globally uh that that has bought some time in certain cases you can see hints of this with you on swap lines where countries that are desperate for dollars move do you want swap lines trade a new one like argentina's done with some commodities recently uh they are obviously not doing that out of a position of strength but that advise them dollar liquidity time but that's they're still tied to the dollar system ultimately so unless they make a clean break to a uh again a fully functioning multi-currency commodity pricing with with a neutral reserve asset like i said net gold settlement their fortunes are still inextricably linked uh on uh to the dollar system so i don't think they can separate yet um until they do that from rex you you like energy how do you prefer to get energy exposure by holding the underlying commodity buying oil stocks buying green energy stocks my biggest exposure on energy personally is a electrical infrastructure equipment maker it's it's via a private equity investment that i've uh that i'm involved with it is generation agnostic in other words the equipment works or if it's coming from nuke if it's coming from coal if it's coming from gas coming from hydro it doesn't matter how the the power is generated it works there's to me it's almost i to me i think it's it's a uh i always think of it as as you know when you when you have a gold rush or when you know the stories about when there was a gold rush out in california uh some of the gold miners got rich most of them went broke uh but the guys who really did well were the guys who sold picks and shovels and so this is i i like to invest in people making picks and shovels in boons so this is a pick and shovel maker and what i think is going to be a very attractive industry electrical infrastructure over the next probably 10 years plus given what we're seeing for a number of different reasons i also own a little bit of of uh copper equities i own some electrical vehicle etfs electrical vehicle metals excuse me etfs those are small in both cases some oil services uh for me gold and bitcoin are chicken plays on energy as well if you look over a long period of time gold trades within a range versus energy the gold is a derivative play of energy it takes energy to mine gold it takes energy to mine bitcoin and so both of those to me are are chicken energy plays not just from the embedded energy but also with the more expensive that oil and energy gets the more pressure that puts on global bond markets the more pressure that puts on global sovereign debt markets the more pressure that puts on central banks and pushes them toward some version of more balance sheet expansion yield curve control which is good for golden bitcoin so i consider those sort of derivative uh uh energy place for gold and bitcoin uh from jim who will win will opec boost oil price or will recession and western counter measures reduce demand and cause prices to fall i think oil is going higher uh i actually think the us is okay with saudi's recent price cut uh or excuse me production cut to try to keep prices up um and the reason i think that is if oil goes too low u.s shale is going to start going offline and if if you remember we've said before shale has been us shale has been about 90 percent of global oil production growth over the last 10 years uh and when it it has a very steep decline rate so if shale production basically just stops drilling you're going to see a pretty sharp decline in u.s shale production on an annualized basis it will actually fall uh more than global demand has ever fallen in a recession so supply marginal supply will fall a lot faster than demand has ever fallen in globally in any recession so to me the supply demand dynamic outlook for oils really positive and geopolitically i think the us is okay with prices here and uh you know not getting too high but i don't think they want them much lower and the reason i think that is if shale rolls over if prices get too low and shale rolls over it's gonna be very difficult to get shale back to new highs in terms of production without us is very significant oil price spike in which case you're going to basically be seeding the oil market to opec and russia which is not in the us's geopolitical interest so i think the u.s is okay with prices here i don't think they want them much lower and i think that's i think saudis actually really just being the adult in the room by cutting production uh let's see from david do you foresee capital controls coming soon for countries that are energy importers with negative balance of payments if not how will governments prevent flight out of the depreciating bonds and currencies uh yeah i think you can see that i mean you can you can see energy importing nations with tune deficits are having problems everywhere right turkey uh in particular argentina was historically another one so the short answer is i i think you'll see more of those metrics attempts to defend currencies uh even the uk right energy importer uh twin deficits are excuse me big current account deficit um that's uh you know they're they're they are in my view uh the bank of england is effectively raising rates um more than expected last week uh there i think there's an element of sort of you know yes fight inflation it's always fight inflation but it's defend the currency uh is is another way of saying that so uh i i think you'll possibly see those capital controls i don't know when i don't know where that will be that's not very helpful i know uh i do think you've been seeing some measures of soft i won't call them capital controls but i'll say regulated you know regulating buying of uh of western sovereign debt uh by virtue of of banking regulations right so here in the u.s i've picked on a lot because i'm most familiar with it but they regulated banks in the bank treasuries they regulated money market funds into buying treasuries they they with the tax code change under trump in 17 or 18 there was a uh a beneficial tax treatment to corporate pensions buying more treasuries so uh that those aren't capital controls per se but they're capital incentives shall we say capital regulations right to accomplish kind of the same thing with a velvet glove uh as opposed to the iron fist so i don't think we're getting to the iron fist point i do think these regulations will continue to intensify because the fiscal problems are only getting worse in the u.s uh and elsewhere uh uh in certain places around the world uh i do think the rate hikes uh the aggressive rate hikes of the past 15 months have helped and bought time on that front so um that that's how i'm thinking about looking at i don't have any concrete answers on yeah i do think it's possible it's very dependent in terms of timing on on events right if you have uh a steep economic correction you might need those types of uh things more quickly than than not if you can kind of soft landing and muddle along um then then maybe they can kind of keep all the plates in the air for for even longer uh and not have to move to those types of of activities uh multiple questions on what's the potential impact of the blackrock bitcoin etf uh i'm going to assume that we'll discuss this as if it gets approved uh probably another one that's a little too soon to tell but i i did have a couple thoughts the first being that i think it's indicative of um institutional demand continuing to uh improve for bitcoin which i think is a positive all-all sequel i did find it interesting that that there is an apparent change of heart that larry fink had uh in terms of where his comments were a few years ago regarding bitcoin and crypto more broadly relative to uh this bitcoin etf filing i also think it's interesting this is the second major you know too big to fail u.s financial institution getting involved with an etf in an asset class that would be amongst the best performers if the fed has to begin re-expanding their balance sheet or move to yield curve control at some point uh in other words uh yeah blackrock get involved uh looking to get involved with bitcoin uh with the bitcoin etf filing and as we've written about talked about in the past jp morgan uh december of last year became the second custodian of the gld gold etf the biggest gold etf in the world uh after uh they became the second custodian alongside hsbc after the gld had been in place for 18 years so just 18 years 18 years after it was launched jp morgan decided it wanted to get involved and then uh jp morgan noted they might move some of the storage out of london um uh to zurich or elsewhere perhaps in new york so uh that is also of interest to me that there seems to be some too big to fail us institutions uh getting involved with assets that i think would be at the top of the list in terms of performance if the fed had to begin regrowing its balance sheet into still elevated inflation so those are the thoughts let's see how it developed those could change but that's that's where i'm at at the moment from john u.s lng export capacity will increase by 10 billion cubic feet per day 2024 2025. do you see continuing lng in oil exports and spr withdrawals as a component of the fed's strategy to defend treasury sales and support dollar liquidity u.s natural gas supply may not be adequate to fill 10 billion cubic feet per day demand uh i thought that's a really good question i i agree 100 with your characterization of it which is that u.s energy exports uh and spr rundowns uh last year are effectively energy swaps with allies that have de facto defend the treasury market you think about this otherwise and we saw this last year in space particularly with japan high energy costs pushed japan into a twin deficit situation they had to sell dollar assets treasuries to raise dollars to import energy because given the choice between having treasury bonds and savings or being short energy uh they get rid of the treasury bonds and they address the energy shortage they address the higher cost energy so by virtue of the us getting oil prices down or by supplying energy into that market that is a de facto defense of the treasury markets it's a oil swap with allies however you want to define it de facto that's effectively what we're what we're talking about here uh i think it's also does tie in with the dollar because ultimately if the energy supply situation gets uh critical enough here too uh allies will have to make a decision go without energy or de-dollarize their energy imports move to buying in their own currency and settling in goods and gold as china uh and others are are effectively doing and uh i think that's uh again it's a defense of the treasury market it's a defense of the uh of the the status quo system the the de facto if the us is exporting oil and gas and running down the spr uh to contain energy markets so uh with that said it basically on you know imports the energy the energy inflation right so by by selling gas you know if we didn't export that gas all else equal uh we would have a surplus of gas here gas would be cheaper and we'd have more deflation here if we're going to put that gas on the open market uh the world market uh that market is priced well above last i checked the u.s domestic gas market so all sql it is an inflationary impulse to the domestic market um uh do i think it will continue yes i do think the u.s will continue to do that uh particularly as the global south continues to de-dollarize their commodity markets led by russia and china in the manner that i that i set out of a manner of national security for them uh and so i think we're just watching the u.s use u.s energy resources uh to de facto support treasury markets into a lesser extent uh the dollar from chris clearly the fiscal u.s fiscal position is dire why do you think most of the macro world is avoiding that elephant in the room is it simply does it make a lot of their analyzes mood or is there something else um you know i i don't i don't i don't know it's hard to speculate i mean in my view if i'm going to speculate i would say it's you know a couple things number one it's it's hard to see things that have never happened before uh and this has not happened in in the u.s in anybody's lifetime myself included and so uh you know that's part of the reason why so many people miss that u.s home prices could fall nationally uh no one thought that was possible uh very very few people thought that was possible ahead of the great financial crisis and uh it's why so many people miss the rub-off effects of home prices falling nationally is this it just um when it hasn't happened it it it's one needs to have more imagination to see it uh the other one kind of falls in line with with upton sinclair's famous quote it's difficult to get a man to see something when his salary depends upon he's not seeing it which is to say pointing out the u.s fiscal situation in certain um seats uh it can be a career limiting move um when you're at a big bank uh making the bond desk angry with you is not a good idea so uh and sort of uh pointing out and harping on the fiscal situation of the u.s uh probably not going to make the treasury the treasury bond desk or the government bond desk and big banks very happy so uh i don't think that's the biggest part of it i think that's a niche reason but i do think um the imagination side of it um is is the much bigger part of it uh and then finally last question from fred explain why the u.s can't solve its debt deficit problem by cutting spending and or raising taxes because it'll send the economy into a session and thus make that the gdp worse and we're all greece now uh yeah that's exactly it is is if you raise taxes you take money out of the pocket of consumers uh you drive a recession if you have a recession a recession that the gdp always rises in recession deficit as a percentage gdp always rises in recession so you can only raise taxes to the point that you don't drive a recession um and in the meantime even if you don't get all the way to a recession anything that drives nominal gdp growth below the rate on the debt with debt the gdp at 120 percent with deficit at eight percent of gdp uh you go into a debt debt spiral so you you gotta keep uh you gotta keep nominal gdp growth above the rate on the debt or you're done and so in the same thing with cutting spending u.s government's 25 of gdp so uh you cut government spending you're going to cut gdp growth same dynamics uh you you can't do that without going in to a death spiral so with that i'm going to finish up for the night as always thank you very much for joining me if you like these

"Fiscal component inflation v. deflation, Gold miner action now v. 2013 Taper, Deflationary signposts",2021-06-30 13:00:14+00:00,13,Xp3mXiyA4oY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp3mXiyA4oY,[music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke grahman fftt hope you're well and had a great weekend i know it was a beautiful weekend here in lovely cleveland ohio getting to be one of the best times of the year with summer and uh summer baseball starting this week so looking forward to it all so with that let me jump in thank you as always for joining first question is from r how should average joe who's invested in a 60 40 portfolio prepare for what's coming in the next 10 to 15 years uh i i think it's really critical to understand or just put in context some of what i call the big gears in macro understand that we're in what appears to be a bursting global sovereign debt bubble also understand that we're in a peak cheap energy regime where you have a secular rise in marginal energy costs marginal oil costs in particular and to me i think if you factor those two things in what that implies is it means longer duration bonds are in essence uh a bet that on an energy productivity miracle as it relates to peak jeep energy for example so in a cheap energy environment owning longer duration bonds is essentially a bet that that an energy productivity miracle will be invented and commercialized in time to offset uh the secularly inflationary outcomes from not just cheap energy but also the global sovereign debt bubble as the productivity miracle would help make that sovereign debt uh repayable in real terms as opposed to via central bank printing so uh setting that aside uh if if we don't get an energy productivity miracle uh i think it's important to understand that you're likely to those two factors together means we're likely going to be an environment that is is highly inflationary over time uh with high sustained volatility uh and so for the average joe in my opinion that means understand that trying to trade that is likely going to be very difficult best case um and so it suggests for the average joe keep your leverage low look for longer term secular opportunities for the average joe they have the luxury of looking out several years many people on wall street many investors don't have the luxury of looking for alpha 12 months out 24 months out 36 months out so look for look for longer term secular opportunities uh one that i've been talking a lot about that i'm familiar with is for example selling into electrical infrastructure companies and industries selling into a build out of electrical infrastructure in the united states i think that's got a long runway to it does it mean it's going to go up in the next three months i don't know does it mean it's going to go up in the next two years five years i like my odds there and importantly uh i can't necessarily compete as an average joe with somebody who's trying to trade minute to minute hour to hour month to month but i can compete if i can be patient with my capital and wait two years five years in a way that they can't so that's another way i would encourage average joe to look at and then finally unless that energy productivity miracle happens uh it means i think you need to take a percentage of what you have in bonds on the 40 and bonds and the four in the classics 60 40 portfolio uh and and put put some into gold put some into gold miners put some of the commodities put a little bit in the bitcoin as your inflation hedges uh and so i think that's that's how i would answer that for uh for an average joe in a 60 40 portfolio uh from stephen i've seen tweets stating that ai is becoming good at investing could next black swan be ai identifying that the entire global debt-backed economy is nothing but a dumpster fire recommending to buy things like gold silver and bitcoin which might only unleash an insane rush it's an interesting thought and i don't laugh at the question i laugh at the phrasing a dumpster fire because it's uh you know you're not wrong so i i it's possible i suppose i i i've looked at ai more from the uh the side of being a turbocharger if you will of deflationary forces technology which are fundamentally incompatible with the debt back system we have which needs exponential growth and inflation uh to keep the debt nominally money good and so for me the acceleration of ai to me will accelerate and pull forward the the print or default choice from the world's central banks so whether it's human to reach that decision or whether it's machines that reach that decision ai that reaches that decision in my opinion doesn't matter a whole lot it gets you to the same spot so to be clear i would not be putting all my money in gold all my money bitcoin things like that i do think it speaks to being overweight uh physical gold and and some bitcoin uh and that's not hard to do particularly if you're an american because the average waiting is is pretty close to zero for most americans so uh next question from costas hi luke great trading support this week thank you very much can you comment on why high-tech ufo materials would land exclusively in the usa is it not possible other nations are also studying the same materials and accelerating their own domestic technologies just as the u.s claims it's doing i think it's a great question um i don't know it's one of these it's it's one of these topics that i'm watching the ufo or uh i guess that's uap is is what they call them now with great interest because to the extent they represent an energy productivity miracle um they could be a game changer and so it's important to uh to keep one eye on it so to speak um yeah there's a number of possible explanations i suppose number one is that we're fudging the day we're fudging uh about it we're like we're exaggerating or lying about it possible but i i just don't know um another explanation is that they are weapons propulsions energy systems that we have or or have have built up however we arrived at the technology that that we have that we're testing it and it's it's highly classified and so these pilots are seeing this stuff at night but it's uh they're only seeing it over the us because it's not going over anybody else's airspace um uh to make sure that nobody else gets a look at it which makes some sense i mean we've been spending 800 to 900 billion dollars a year for a number of years in defense it's a lot of money uh so you know it's not like you know when you see these stories about the thousand dollar wrenches that the pentagon buys it's it's usually my view on that it's not a thousand dollar rent it's a five dollar wrench and 955 dollars of uh different investments elsewhere so uh the third possibility to your point costa says hey yeah others do have some of this type of technology and they're just not advertising it or or it's not being detected that those are i think the three possible but like i said for me the reason i'm keeping one eye on this and have been for uh the last 12 18 months it's just understanding that through my lens of the world how i'm seeing the world how i'm seeing the data and the context a game changer would be an energy productivity miracle and these represent a potential for that so that's why that's why we keep keep an eye on it from sg do you think the u.s will be seeking to return to something like the pre-1971 system or do you think they will turn to something else like a modern bancor scheme i think the way the system is evolving is to more of a modern bancore scheme i don't think gold's going to be pegged to any currency uh i think gold is at least in the intermediate term going to serve a as a neutral reserve asset for particularly commodity related deaths that's energy related deficits that float you know and then gold floats in price in all currencies so that's it that is bancor-like and that's where i think the system is evolving to uh from 8745 it seems the narrative is shifting to raising rates raises inflation and we are entering the elect an election year excuse me where the political creature jay powell may feel some pressure so what happens if the fed cuts rates in half and one q or 2q 24 how many of the current problems go away uh in my view very few of the problems go away they just change shape so right now we're having government funded or government driven inflation uh so deficits as a result of rising rates and we're seeing bank problems uh and and if they slashed rates in half in the first half of next year then i think you go back to more sort of classic private sector driven inflation um i think that then translates into bond market um concerns the long end would probably sell off possibly meaningfully which then has some um broader implications as the inflation i think would pick up on rate cuts i think you'd have money flocking out of bonds into stocks and commodities etc so uh like i said i i don't know that you fix anything i think you just move the pot the troubles around you sort of stick your finger in the dike in one area and a new hole pops out and ultimately the issue is deficits are too big that's too big um and and you have to inflate that away for a period of time to get rid of that problem otherwise anytime you try to make an adjustment you're just going to be creating a new problem somewhere else so which is exactly what we've seen and in the span of less than 12 months we went from oh gosh inflation to oh gosh bank problems so that's exactly what i mean and with some volatility in between obviously you know the bottom line is you need significantly negative real interest rates for a sustained period of time to inflate that the gdp down to a sustainable percentage from which the fed can raise rates without breaking something quickly or you need that energy productivity miracle that we were talking about before so with that i'm going to finish up for tonight as always thank you very much for joining me if you like these updates check us out fftt llc.com

[applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hey everybody luke graham and fftt hope you had a great weekend i know we had a great weekend here weather was beautiful was down watching the marietta pioneers win the ncaa regional they were in a translation there's 389 division iii baseball teams in the u.s marietta is now in the sweet 16. so they're moving on uh this weekend they'll play in a super regional which is super exciting so we'll be watching we'll be watching that as well so go pioneers so with that introduction i also want to just briefly apologize if i sound or look a little funny or sound or look a little funnier than usual perhaps i got a little dental work done this afternoon so we're going to push through uh we're not going to let it hold us back so with that said let me jump right in first question is from cal what is your best guess as to what is going on with the bond market regarding the fed is deviating from the two-year bond the two year treasury uh and bond traders are pricing in cuts while the fed repeats higher for longer i think bond markets are looking at a capital crunch coming in the next few months where uh you have commercial real estate uh venture capital uh the u.s government and possibly even u.s banks all competing for a shrinking amount of capital and i think that has the risk and it poses the risk of of sending us into another crisis pretty quickly going from everything is awesome to holy cow pretty quickly and so i think bond markets are looking at that just basically the gross issuance uh coming in the back half of this year uh from all those entities and there's i don't i just don't think there's a sufficient balance sheet and so i think that's what they are watching what the feds watching i don't know i i can make a case that there's an element of sort of currency wars going on where they're trying to continue to weaponize the dollar on some level i i i really don't know what they're thinking and and so but that's what i think i think that's what the bond market sees i think the bond market's right uh from maria can you explain in detail your tweet quote that the only way we do not have an oil supply supply crisis in coming years is if treasuries fall sharply against oil uh yeah so u.s shale production has been 90 of global production growth over the last 10 years according to bloomberg's citing envirus energy uh u.s shale production is rolling over uh and so basically we need higher oil prices just to keep u.s shale production and therefore global production probably flat or or grow from here uh so if oil prices don't rise sharply against treasuries i.e if oil prices don't rise sharply in u.s dollar terms then you're gonna you're gonna see a negative impact on global oil supplies uh as a result of u.s shale production uh rolling over uh faster basically it needs higher prices and i.e a supply crisis so there's some path uh fluidity to that in other words can you get lower oil prices for a bit sure but it's it's not sustainable uh if you don't want to have a pretty severe supply crisis that should be pretty self-regulating in terms of of oil prices um just given that as you look back over the last 45 years uh global oil demand is fell the two worst declines annually in global oil demand were 19 i believe 80 or 81 down 3 percent 3.8 percent something like that and in 2020 when we basically shut down the global economy it was down like eight percent year over year so the bottom line is oil demand even in really really bad economies doesn't fall that much so uh shale supply if you stopped drilling for new would probably fall uh 15 20 25 annually on just a little bit of a lag so um that's what i mean where you need oil prices to rise further to continue to incentivize growing shale production so that's what i meant by that uh from robert uh average credit scores continue to rise to the highest level in 15 years and unemployment is down to its lowest in 15 years all while credit card debt rises that doesn't feel like the private sector has a debt problem the dollar will remain the reserve currency in safe haven until significant deglobalization occurs or energy is priced in gold this appears to be happening however glacially investors would rather stay with something like treasuries that are ingrained in the economy rather than trying new things like gold or bitcoin investors have been known to follow the herd off the cliff all these things imply to me a much longer timeline before a debt spiral occurs can you give me your take and how you see the timeline differently so i would say the problem i agree the problem is not in the private sector remember we had a stock bubble in 2000 we kicked it upstairs to the banking sector when the stock bubble burst by generating a housing bubble housing bubble burst we kicked it upstairs to the global sovereign debt levels levels by virtue uh of uh the backstops to the banking system put in place by global sovereign so the issue is not in the private sector the issues in public sector debt uh in the west this is the first time in almost 100 years that we've had a public sector a global sovereign debt bubble particularly and it's centered in the west so i would argue the debt spiral has already begun it forced the fed to stop hiking rates in the fourth quarter of 2018 it forced the repo rate spike in september 2019 uh that drove the fed to begin regrowing their balance sheet and what they called not qe uh it it drove the treasury market to crash the off the run treasury market to crash at the height of the covet crisis in march 2020 which had never happened in my career in stan druckenmiller's career as he said a year later um that led to the fed doing what i've termed super qe uh the treasury market dysfunction in september 2022 it led to um and that led janet yellen to say she was concerned about treasury market functioning and and was followed immediately immediately by a pretty sharp episode of us dollar weakness uh it led to the bank crisis in march 2023 and uh resulted in btfp from the fed which was basically a soft version of yield curve control for banks for treasuries so every time you hear treasury market dysfunction out there that what they're really saying is that's a u.s federal debt debt spiral symptoms getting more acute that's what that means and so we've we are already i think at least five years into this i would argue the kickoff was really when foreign central banks stopped growing their holdings of treasuries back in 2014 on that and so since then foreign central banks have sold 350 billion in treasuries they've bought around 325 350 billion in gold uh as long as foreign central banks are not growing their holdings with treasuries enough and they continue to not do so for a variety of reasons then you're going to continue to have supplies of treasuries pile up like they did in the famous episode of i love lucy with the chocolates where the conveyor belt just keeps running faster and faster and and lucy and her friend are grabbing the chocolates and they're stuffing them in their in their pockets and they're stuffing them in their hats and they're stuffing them in their mouths and trying to figure out what to do with these treasures i mean this banking crisis this was in part because these banks got stuff full of treasuries they were regulated into buying treasuries over the last eight to nine years after central banks stopped on net so uh every time lucy's pockets and hat and mouth get too full with chocolates you're gonna have treasury market dysfunctioning uh and that's really just balance sheets private sector balance sheets getting too full uh and then you're going to have some sort of incident repo rates bike off the run crash dysfunction september 22 banking crisis and then the fed's gonna have to make a decision do they want to stand aside and let a debt spiral really happen or do are they going to grow their balance sheet again to prevent it and in my view they will they've repeatedly each other not in my view factually they have repeatedly uh chosen the latter and in my view they will continue to choose the latter they could always unchoose and that's part of the reason why i continue to maintain an elevated cash balance is they may try to bluff the market they may play chicken with the market and say we're not going to step in this time good luck don't step in see how that works out for you uh in my view in the end they may they can't bluff the market for a bit but in the end they're gonna have to step in and grow the balance sheet so that's that's how i see it differently i think it's important to see the debt problem the debt bubble the bubble and everything it's not it's not in private sector assets the bubble is in western sovereign debt uh and in particular the risk the risk-free asset underpinning all the other assets has risk either nominal or credit risk and that's the first time in anybody's career anyone trading today has ever seen that so uh that's that's how i see it differently from david any updates on the daisy chain qe thesis is it still a possibility uh yes it's a possibility i saw in march uk holding to treasuries up 70 billion dollars um uh march versus february um up not that much year over year so uh you are seeing some buy in canada bought a little bit as well march over february so so maybe uh but not a big increase so it's it's inconclusive let's let's wait and see um but uh i'm still watching to see if we get more follow through on that uh from john to what extent do global holders of dollar debt also hold dollar bond and stock assets i'm wondering what effect of a slowdown in global commerce would have based on dollar debt holders who may need to look to other sources of dollars it's a great question it's a really important question that's why i always cite and make a big deal about the u.s net international investment position at negative 70 percent of gdp uh that is far more negative than it's ever been before or even in 2008 that number was negative eight to ten percent of gdp in 2001 that number was negative one to three percent of gdp and prior to that it was positive what that means is is at negative 70 of gdp foreigners own 18 trillion dollars net more dollar assets than we own of their assets so bottom line they're net long dollars they're just not in dollar format and to your point it amounts to basically foreigners having an 18 trillion dollar piggy bank of dollars that they can break and grab the money out of when they need it what does break and grab the money out of look like dump treasuries to get dollars like they did last year dump stocks to get dollars like they did last year uh and this is why too strong a dollar has consistently driven aggressive dollar asset sales uh going back at least five six years so it's a great question yes they can they own assets and they can sell them to get dollars if need be uh from andrew with respect to the issues faced by commercial real estate you discussed in this week's tree rings do you have an opinion on how single family home values will fare over the next couple years uh i don't have a strong view i think some of it of course as as always with real estate depends on location uh if you if you force me to take a view i would i would probably say overall as an asset class i think it'll continue to kind of be like what we've seen over the last 12 to 18 months which are brief periods of weakness but overall between being a hard asset uh and and and the reality that the us government needs sustained high inflation and negative real interest rates uh to continue to sustain the debt levels that they have i think it will probably continue to fare just fine as an asset class i don't see anything like a 2008 kind of scenario again where you get this just unmitigated uh housing crash because again the problem is at the public level an unmitigated housing crash basically implies the fed is willing to stand aside and let the treasury market go and i just i don't think they're going to let that happen for very long if at all uh from george is there a reasonably likely pathway for yellen to top up the tga without affecting or even increasing liquidity in my opinion it's unlikely that she could top up the tga without negatively impacting dollar liquidity um maybe and this is just me sort of trying to spitball for some ideas maybe she could use the exchange stabilization fund which again is a pretty good pretty big fund that has very little oversight she and the president can can use as they see fit to impact uh currency markets uh exchange rates gold markets etc uh maybe she could use the esf to weaken the dollar uh while tapping up the tga so withdrawing down the liquidity with the tga while um manipulating currency markets with the esf for lack of a better word um i don't know how easy that would be to do currency markets are very big esf is big but not enormous not infinite um but it would be theoretically possible at least uh and again i'm just spitballing trying to think out loud for how it she could do it um so you'd be adding dollar liquidity by weekend reducing dollar liquidity by topping up the tga but beyond that i don't i don't really know how she could do that other than my baby really ramping up tre you know uh spending uh you know just fiscal spending so uh that's uh those are my thoughts there and then the final question from simon you're highlighting uh you've highlighted excuse me how federal spending drives gdp which drives tax receipts how does the potential for a lower rate of spending growth out of the debt ceiling uh deal influence your outlook if they actually lowered spending or lowered spending growth both of which i'm skeptical onto varying degrees then all else equal that would probably drive what we saw last year in 2q and 3q when you actually did have a decline in federal spending it was pretty notable for a brief moment in time in the grand scheme of things which is spending down dollar is measured by dxy up inflation down sequentially gdp growth down uh sequentially and actually nominally for a quarter or quarter or two uh and that would be followed pretty shortly thereafter by increasing treasury market dysfunction and and then ultimately uh receipts uh uh assets down asset prices down and then not too far after that tax receipts down so and then you'd probably get into banking strains again uh like we saw earlier this year and then we'd get into fed liquidity injections of some description like we saw this year so uh great question but that's how i would think about if they really ratcheted back on the spending um that that's sort of the i think the the flow chart of my view of how it would work so with that i'm going to finish up for tonight thank you as always for joining me and uh if you're interested in these types of updates check out fftt tree rings you can learn more information about that at fftt llc.com as well as what we're up to etc and in the meantime thanks again for

Why I sold a good chunk of BTC two weeks ago; where we are in the cycle; Basel 3 gold rule changes,2021-05-25 13:00:06+00:00,16,GB7iKkk52bA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB7iKkk52bA,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke graham and fftt hope you are well and had a great weekend we definitely had a great weekend here we uh who's down in lovely marietta ohio watching the marietta pioneers win two games two big conference games on saturday including the second game of the double header we had a a walk-off home run to win in the bottom of the 10th uh uh the brett carson number four marietta stud hit or uh had a nice oppo left field home run to win it which was super exciting for the guys loved watching them celebrate so with that we're going to jump right into the questions thank you in advance for everybody submitting them really appreciate it it's always fun having these conversations so let's jump in from ts can you tie together the consequences of two trillion dollars plus in federal deficits climbing to three and a half to five trillion dollars or more in a recession the u.s net international position u.s net international investment position excuse me being negative 70 percent of gdp and the nascent trend away from treasuries in the us dollar is primary reserve asset uh yeah when you when you boil it all together or when you when you when you put it all together and boil it down uh more accurately either the fed grows its balance sheet or the us government crowds out global dollar markets at an accelerating rate uh it sends the dollar up and everything else down including treasury bonds uh sending u.s and everybody else since the dollar is the global reserve currency into a global debt death spiral of higher deficits higher debt higher rates higher dollar until the system collapses or until the fed steps in and the longer that goes on uh the more incentive uh for global central banks to buy gold and not treasuries you'll start to see gold outperform u.s real rates and tips which is exactly what we've seen since 2022. um ultimately because the us government and any other governments can't afford rates above a certain level and there's really nothing more positive for gold than sovereign debt crises so that's that's when you put all those things together those that is you're going to get either a vicious cycle down death spiral uh death spiral or you're going to get an inflationary spiral up it's no longer some dial where the fed if they just do the right thing they can get into some nice little disinflationary period like they had for 20 25 years from call it 95 through through 2020. that's i don't think that's on the uh the menu of options uh from gc do you see liquidity being really the only driver of asset prices going forward and the most important metric to look at and do you see central bank liquidity expanding or contracting over the next seven months maybe not the only driver of asset prices going forward but i think a if not the primary driver uh and i think the most important swing factor i see and and to answer the second part of the question i see central bank liquidity expanding over the next six months because if it doesn't it implies a western sovereign debt crisis getting much worse perhaps starting as soon as a month from now here in the united states uh let's see uh from jj do do does ai plus robotics equal that productivity miracle needed to prevent sovereign debt bubble dilemma uh it's a bit of a paradox in the long run yes i think it absolutely could be exactly that uh a productivity miracle however between here and there that productivity miracle is massively deflationary for wages tax receipts um and as a result brings forward the fiscal problems of the west dramatically uh and and china as well for that matter so uh as as unemployment surges robots take jobs etc western sovereign debt global sovereign debt blows up and then requires central bank backstops of that debt which then ends up being inflationary uh or ubi is brought to bear uh something like that so long run yes short run uh it accelerates what's setting up as a bumpy ride anyway now from qa things are starting to take shape but there are still long lags before market prices catch up to narratives every slash reality what metrics should we should we be looking for to know it's time to place bets so we don't get wrecked by volatility in the meantime uh tactically i'm watching u.s treasury volatility very closely uh as just a kind of a a a a signpost of where we are a north star of where we are at that moment in time um in this process secularly i i'm watching true interest expense treasury spending plus entitlement pay goes as a percent of tax receipts um every time it gets near 100 or over that is a huge moment we're basically there now um that means either more liquidity comes or it doesn't and things get really ugly really fast until it does come um i think it's really important in this process to to remember where we are which is we are at in the first bursting global cyber debt bubble in 100 years at the end of a a 50-year currency system where it's shifting from dollar reserve status uh from from dollar dollar globers or currency treasury primary reserve asset to dollar global reserve currency to i think in the meantime it's gonna be gold going back to the neutral reserve asset we're changing the system though is the point um and and my point here is it's really important to remember it's gonna be super hard to trade uh i i'm not trying to trade it one of my best relationships on wall street is a veteran macro trader you know he says all the time i i don't think anyone's gonna be able to trade this was like i trade i traded a long time for a living it's going to be super hard to try to to try to trade this um it's not something he's trying to do i think it's important to remember gold price volatility in weimar germany remember it was even though they ultimately hyperinflated as always i'm not saying we're gonna hyper inflate i'm just saying in a very extreme case that seemed like a one-way trade it was anything but uh you got carried out multiple times if you got too aggressive so um it's too political it's too volatile too much leverage it makes the volatility i think is going to be a feature of our operating environment we just need to adjust to it so uh in my opinion continue thinking better off being conservative with leverage holding enough you know plenty of cash and then playing for what i think is the ultimate end game with part of the portfolio as well and really thinking about this period in time in terms of surviving and stewarding your capital from one side to the other uh versus trying to win big through this process because the volatility the debt uh the political volatility there are real risks that trying to play for the you know swing for the fences you end up striking out for for lack of a better word uh from dc can you explain or can you expand excuse me on u.splay's trump card adopting bitcoin as reserve asset given one the us currently has no bitcoin reserves and two it's questionable that energy exporters accept bitcoin as an asset three choke point for bitcoin that was an interesting point on the on the on the potential choke point of bitcoin uh in terms of the ability to choke it off in the internet i'm just not technically proficient enough in terms of whether that is a possibility my understanding is that is in theory one way you could stop bitcoin is by shutting down the internet however the fault of that the the flaw in that strategy you can see immediately is that you shut down the internet you're gonna basically blow up the economy um obviously the paper in question that i read through uh it wasn't about shutting down the entire internet it's being able to sort of filter certain file types and i just don't have enough technical proficiency to know uh the validity of that so i'll put that out to some friends of mine see what they have to say about it uh in terms of the other two um you know the us currently having no bitcoin reserves and and whether energy exporters would adopted um in my opinion it's a little bit like what china's been using with gold is once you can get one big exporter to agree um then the announcement you know basically that begins to force others to do the same um and the announcement i think itself would send bitcoin to the moon which would free up supplies probably domestically it's not that the u.s they have some i think that they've confiscated from the uh um oh the uh whatever was the dark web uh uh use cases uh is my understanding but setting that aside uh an announcement that u.s trade would be settled in bitcoin going forward as uh a possible solution laid out by jason lowry in his book software uh i think would send bitcoin to the moon it would ultimately amount to a massive dollar devaluation versus bitcoin which would then free up the bitcoin held within our borders at the right valuation of bitcoin relative to u.s debt i would actually consider uh swapping swapping out at some much higher price from here um but that that is something to think about if you got bitcoin collateralizing u.s debt fully um uh as you saw with gold in 1980 uh that's that would that would free up supplies uh for use as a trade settlement mechanism i'm just thinking out loud here um and in terms of the the relative advantage you're seeing china and russia use gold in this capacity uh you've seen bitcoin outperform gold since its inception uh it is a harder currency um objectively than gold is um that could actually seize back the advantage to if we're moving to a neutral reserve asset uh russia and china combined produce more gold than the u.s um that would move it to a system that is uh uh capped and is um would then basically allow competition not based on who has the most gold reserves but based on um who's the most productive uh and that's that's a situation where i think over time the us does very very well so uh js what happens if we reverse a 1913 jekyll island and give control of the u.s currency to the treasury eliminate the federal income tax uh massive inflation uh i think i think think that that's a version of the chicago plan something called the chicago plan but don't don't hold me that i'm i'm thinking out loud but the gist of it is is moving in that direction i i think we're moving that direction already marrying treasury and fed a bit more or at least trying to force it in that direction when you're looking at things like restoring industrial capacity um that's i think a direction that is is possible a la world war ii um we're not all the way there yet though so that's the that's that's that's that's what happens if treasury takes over from fred it's going to be inflationary that's what happened to world war ii so that's that's the better way to answer that so uh and then jp what's your opinion of jeff snyder's deflationary monetary or money money scenario you've said we might get deflation for about a cup of coffee that i i that i take you think it would be a very temporary event it seems he dismisses a response to the deflation or am i wrong uh i love jeff i love jeff's work i think he's brilliant uh i do think we could get a brief deflationary whoosh i i think that's fully possible i where i disagree with him is that it would is is the context of that deflation in other words uh u.s debt levels are so high u.s deficits are so high so structural a sustained deflation would mean treasuries would quickly be at risk of default as well as a lot of other global sovereign debt around the world without fed qe and so um i i don't think that that would be a good scenario ultimately for treasuries uh maybe initially but again the longer it went on and people began to realize oh gosh maybe they're not going to make the coupon payments that the fed doesn't step in here i think you'd see the market make a transition to gold is collateral um either by proclamation or rule or or de facto so that's where i i i disagree on the how long it can be sustained in any periodices of deflation can be sustained and ultimately the reason is is governments of the fiat currency tend to not default on their debt they can print the money yes it requires gobs of printing uh i think that's what they'll do with if push comes to shove and then finally from tina do you consider there's enough time left for another episode of mr x uh i i think may i think maybe i think we're getting towards um the later innings here but i think there could be a time still for another episode i've i certainly have the material i've written a number of reports uh for clients using mr x uh um so there's there's some material there uh but let's let's watch so with uh with that i'm gonna finish up for tonight i want to thank everybody for being here as usual uh as always if you like these updates please check out fftt tree rings fftt loc.com for more information about that 10 most interesting things brief synopsis on what grabbed us about each point uh usually it's something that either uh refutes uh a way we'd been thinking about the world before or uh adds further confirmation of a trend that is gaining momentum uh we get a lot of we get a lot of great feedback on it so thanks for joining me as always everybody have a great week i look forward to chat with you

[applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke grahman fftt hope everybody had a great weekend it was beautiful weather here over the last week in cleveland in the mid 70s and lower 80s for pretty much most of the week so felt a little bit like being in florida usually this time of year so we will take it so at any rate let me jump right in thank you as always for joining me first questions from bba do you think the net present value of our 200 trillion dollars of unfunded liabilities was reduced due to the pandemic induced inflation i think there's a couple different puts and takes here it made health care more expensive uh via inflation as well as with the cost of living adjustments um with that said so so that would that would raise the price uh however i would guess that the cost of living adjustments were probably not as high as the actual inflation so that would reduce the net present value um all else equal in addition uh the rate hikes we've seen in the last year just by virtue of of how net present value math works would pretty substantially reduce the net present value given the pace of hikes over the last year i don't know by how much but given how much they raised rates it would be it would be a pretty big reduction in the npv of of that of those obligations and then i would also say and it's it's morbid but i think it's objective and therefore needs to be said uh the higher death rates amongst older americans and in particular the sickest uh uh older americans caused by the pandemic probably over time i would guess would reduce the npv as well no measure of how much um and thus far it hasn't shown up in the data in terms of a decline so you any any case made that it has would have to be a counterfactual in other words you'd have to make a case that had it not happen and had those older americans not passed away sadly that the costs would be even higher than they are and i just don't know how to measure that i've not seen anything on that but um we're not seeing declines as a result of in terms of annual cost rather than npv which is uh there's a lot of ways you can play with the npv to me the key number is the cash out every year the cash out is still up uh pretty notably uh that's the entitlement pay goes thing i always talk about in terms of of uh cash flow out this year so let's see what happens it's something i've been keeping an eye on for the last two years so far it has not showed up in declines from tt what are your thoughts on oil supply and demand given years of poor capital expenditures a possible incoming recession on top of opec cuts here too we've got a number of different puts and takes opec has been warning of secular declines in supplies due to under investment some pretty drastic potential declines in global oil supplies between 2026 and 2030 if a whole bunch of money hundreds of billions is not spent basically to keep production where it is importantly ninety percent of supply growth in the past 10 years have come from u.s shale in our last the last time we calculated it using the eia's productivity monthly productivity report uh u.s shale was declining at six percent per month um critically as drilling slows or stops the pace of the rate the pace of decline of existing shale wells will decline so while it might be six percent per month now that would slow it's probably more like somewhere between 20 and 30 percent decline rates on an annualized basis if you stopped all shale drilling uh so this is where the puts and takes comes in short term obviously there have been recession concerns about oil and oil prices with that said uh the worst recession annual declines in global oil consumption in the past 45 years was a four percent annual demand decline in 1980 and a nine percent annual decline year over year in 2020 when obviously the global economy was all but shut down so if we have shale ninety percent of global supply growth over the last 10 years declining at six percent per month roughly if drilling stopped for at least several months uh as i said that that rate of decline would decline with each passing month uh you could be you could see 90 percent of supply growth down 20 to 30 percent annually easily uh opec cuts are further supportive of oil prices and so my point here is that it seems to me the weighting of a recession on oil prices is probably overcooked relative to the supply side response that would likely come from shale that obviously being supported by opec basically my my where i shake out on it is i'd be very surprised if we get another huge decline in oil prices uh even in a recession given the supply side dynamics uh i think to get a huge decline you basically need another global shutdown because you're just looking at rates of supply side decline of some important parts of the of the supply base that vastly outstrip uh basically anything other than a global shutdown so let's watch from alex are there any books or essays you recommend on the history of reserve currencies or the pound in particular and how it lost its status one that i think is a must read for everybody and i've said this many times as lords of finance by leah cuar ahmed it's a biopic on the central bankers of the uk us germany and france from call it 1918 through 1939 give or take it it reads i read it first time in i think 2010 and it has been just an indispensable guide yes times change yes technology changes human nature never changes and so it is just so useful to see the challenges these central bankers faced how similar they are to the ones our central bankers have faced really since the great financial crisis and how similar their responses have been uh it ends up being very useful from a uh from a predictive standpoint from pj please expand on ratio of gold versus silver for precious metals allocation and preferred denomination and type of each i.e one ounce of gold versus 1 10 ounce 10 ounce silver bar for one ounce versus one ounce coin sovereign issued versus exchange stamped i prefer one ounce sovereign gold coins smaller denominations certainly if they make sense then by all means they do carry higher premiums notably higher premiums typically and so for me i it you end up paying more for the same underlying ounce of gold which i just don't like to do and don't recommend uh i i prefer gold to silver overall and precious metals allocation i i think silver will do well with that said it is more of an industrial metal obviously it has more cyclicality to it in that way uh but but critically only gold is on central bank balance sheets central banks do not hold silver and that suggests to me that gold is the only metal of the two that can be written up to recapitalize central bank balance sheets whenever that needs to eventually happen and so i do own some silver i prefer coins there too the one ounce coins sovereign coins um just for ease of use and resale with that said they do tend to carry at least lately very high premiums i don't know if that is a a minting issue because the premiums don't seem as high on bars but that's those are just those premiums on on the one ounce sovereign gold or silver coins have been too rich for my blood at the moment so um that's um you know there may be some dealers out there that don't have those premiums and i would look into to sourcing it from them if that's your your preference uh let's see hi luke recently saw some tweets regarding the dwindling of the tga and i the need of a hail mary and tax receipts what do you think would be the fed's move in interest rates if receipts are low and the debt ceiling approach is faster in in my opinion the fed's third unspoken third mandate was shown to remain in effect last month with the btfp swap lines etc which is the the unspoken mandate is is treasury market functioning they will not stand aside when the treasury market dysfunction gets too great and so if we get a situation where tax receipts come in worse than expected which is my base case uh the debt ceiling would then hit sooner than expected which is probably also i guess my best my base case in my in my opinion all i'll sequel those two factors would serve to increase treasury market dysfunction treasury market volatility which has come down pretty meaningfully uh over the last two weeks given these liquidity injections so my base case is the fed has shown their hand they are who we thought they were as dennis green famously said they are going to manage treasury liquidity to make sure there isn't dysfunction and quicker debt ceiling worse tax receipts will heighten in my view treasury dysfunction all else equal which i think will draw the fed back in in liquidity as needed um don't know what that means for rates but i do think it means liquidity will be provided as needed if needed uh which for for for our purposes is probably all we need to know from bb why did the fed create positive real rates luke you thought for many years negative real rates was the only solution like post-world war ii does the fed have another purpose i don't know there was another question regarding uh thoughts about tom longo's uh thoughts on terms of the fed and maybe some others acting um in in the interest of trying to prevent some wars etc i i don't know i don't know if it was desperation it was dogma if there's something else going on they i i think i think it might just be a case the outcomes razor explanation is simply they saw risk to their credibility uh with inflation and with high inflation sort of everything that they've strung together over the last in terms of how the system works all of it was based on the assumption that inflation would never return and so i i i think it's more just desperation to get inflation back down with that said the inflation that they are so desperate to get back down was the only thing keeping the u.s fiscal situation from going completely pear-shaped it was the only thing keeping the us government solvent and by solvent i mean keeping u.s government receipts above true interest expense of entitlement pay goes plus treasury spending so they're they're now getting upside down on that metric where uh if they're not there yet they will soon be in my in my analysis back in a position they the us government will be back in a position where uh treasury receipts are not covering true interest expense on an annualized basis that is very dollar positive because it creates a dollar squeeze but it's also very um treasury market volatility positive and remember we just said the fed's unspoken third mandate is to make sure the treasury market functions properly so ultimately this dynamic that the only thing keeping the u.s government solvent was the inflation the very same inflation the fed has been doggedly fighting for the last year i don't get the sense it's very well understood by consensus at the moment i think consensus is going to understand this in the next couple of months based on events as they do and as they understand a either the fed finances the difference are we getting more of the 2022 dollar up everything else down treasury market dysfunction regime uh or they probably skip right to the part of the movie where they just assume the fed's going to come back in with more liquidity to keep treasury market uh just keep keep treasury market liquidity high and and volatility within a manageable range as we saw the fed do last month uh from chris i would be very curious to hear your thoughts on the u.s brazilian real cross rate and where you think it might be going over the next year next three years and why specifically in regards to the latest lula visit with china perhaps reflexively what that says about the dollar so there's there's as i think about the question a great question i think about it in two two dynamics as it relates to fx relative fx rates there's there's two key components uh there is relative interest rates which has really been the only thing that's sort of mattered for for relative interest rates um by and large over the last couple slash several decades and basically in plain english will brazil out hawk the fed or world brazilian central bank not uh got into my head they probably won't they historically haven't i they probably won't i'm not that well versed in um where their fiscal situation is there the brazilian fiscal situation is so i don't have a strong feeling on will the brazilian central bank out hawk the fed over the next year uh probably not with that said that brings us to the second component of relative fx valuation and how little that is being discussed and this ties into the lula china visit which is to say there's a second component to relative fx valuations and that is balance of payments and capital slash capital flows most market participants have not had to think about this vis-a-vis emerging markets in a long time but this is where this china china brazil direct trade dynamic starts to get really really interesting non-dollar settlement of brazilian commodities would start to give brazil a lot greater leverage potentially in managing their own domestic dollar liquidity so if we think about this ghana came out and said we use gold for oil right and it's not exactly the same problem as as brazil brazil is a net exporter commodities but in the four months since ghana said we've begun using gold for oil ghana's inflation rate has gone from 155 to 63 massive declines in inflation still elevated but massive sequential declines inflation has basically collapsed uh as a friend of mine said gold works right gold gold works to so the point here is is that if brazil as we look out over the next three years if brazil is actually really successful in moving to more yuan trade direct they can they can accept you on for commodities and increasing amounts use those you want to buy chinese goods settle some of those goods with with in net gold settlement potentially potentially frees up dollar liquidity that brazil can then use to manage the brazil real or the dollar the brazilian real dollar cross rate in a way more advantageously to brazil and at any rate it suggests that brazil might be getting a third lever that right now china has brazil doesn't which is instead of either raising rates to defend the brazilian real or burning down fx reserves selling dollars to defend the brazilian real they could start changing the uh the percentage of trade done in dollars save their dollars for elsewhere it starts to open up a a third lever for brazil to manage its cross rate against the dollar and so next year i i don't know uh will they out hawk the fed probably not they've not had a good track record on their front the next three years i think there's a i i think whatever the market chance is in terms of where they think the real is going to be over the next three years i think it'll be stronger than expected versus the dollar um based on the d dollarization of their trade with china which is like a third of their trade uh freeing up dollar supplies to allow them a third lever to manage uh the brazil dollar cross rate so long way of background but i think it's important uh hopefully that helps and then the final question from sh what are the best measures of liquidity that of the most meaningful correlations positive or negative the s p 500 performance where can they be found uh the one i've seen that i think is a it's it's sort of a a texas hedge it's not it's not perfect but i think it's helpful is has been the fed balance sheet minus reverse repo balance minus treasury general account and that gives you a sense for where liquidity broad dollar liquidity has been moving in this regime it is not perfect you have to also consider what is happening to the relative dollar level uh as the dollar strengthens that against other currencies globally that reduces global liquidity all else equal in a way that is difficult to measure because there's a lot of foreign debt denominated in dollars so basically as the dollar goes up dollar debt grabs a greater amount of liquidity of the world similarly if the dollar falls that adds to liquidity again in a difficult to measure way but it basically increases the amount of global liquidity as as dollar debt service consumes a smaller portion of global income statement if you will and then oil has kind of the same dynamic higher oil ll sql restricts dollar liquidity and and lower oil uh increases it with again that is changing as as countries start being able to buy oil outside the dollar including china the biggest oil importer in the world that dynamic is a little more fluid but that at least i think helps give a framework for metrics you can you can watch and plug in and you can find the fed balance sheet the reverse repo balance and the tga balance in in the fed fred website so um you can check those out online you can construct that index yourself i i have so with that i'm going to finish up for the night i want to thank everybody for joining me as always if you like these updates check out

"Inflation – transitory or not & what to watch for to know; Potential BTC bans, & Yield Curve Control",2021-04-26 15:21:45+00:00,15,z2Lpam5eNUE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2Lpam5eNUE,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke graham and fftt hope you are well and had a great weekend gonna jump right into the update today uh first question from panish other than golden bitcoin which assets are good to own given current macroeconomic conditions is real estate still a good asset in this environment uh we've been talking a lot where um balance and low leverage is the key in this environment things are happening that haven't happened in at least 100 years if ever uh and things are highly political highly geopolitical and so it's really important to remain balanced and to remain under levered uh we've been talking about having we came into the year with 25 30 percent in cash and short-term treasuries 30 to 35 percent in gold and bitcoin and then a blend of energy related commodities industrial equities um etc uh is how we personally have been allocated i personally have been allocated uh uh and that's been our recommendation continue to be our recommendation in terms of real estate without getting into too much detail i think it depends on the ass side of its cash flowing luxury unique finite then i i think absolutely it's a good asset um farmland timberland lake houses you can rent beach houses uh things like that i think are and remain very attractive pieces of property i think there there's other areas where there's probably still some risk in terms of possible reductions in lending in terms of potential refinancing risk things you know certain strip center and retail given changes in the economy etc uh in terms of certain office uh commercial real estate places and and centers those are the types of things um you know i think you take on a case-by-case basis in terms of their being risk as they always say all real estate's local right i think i think that may have maybe never more true than right now from fh how problematic is the recent clampdown on crypto in the u.s for bitcoin it's it's likely going to increase volatility even more um and that's something you have to be prepared for uh i don't think it changes the ultimate outlook i would manage it um and have continued to manage bitcoin volatility not by trying to trade around it but by simply managing position size if you are up uh checking your price of bitcoin and you're getting all excited when it's up and it's not when it's and getting all upset when it's down you're too big get smaller and so i think it's really important to understand it's probably going to increase volatility even more manage it via position sizing uh the other thing is i would encourage you to keep coins off the exchanges and use exchanges to buy uh but i keep my coins off exchange on a uh an uh a cold storage app that was recommended to me uh by people that i really trust uh on bitcoin from ss detail about how difficult it is for the world to transition into a new world reserve currency other than the dollar and maintain it some think it's going to happen by september to me the biggest misperception i see regarding this whole dollar reserve currency discussion is the argument that something else some other fiat currency will replace the dollar i keep hearing what will replace the doll what what currency is going to replace the dollar's global reserve currency that argument is a total straw man argument nothing's going to replace the dollar as global reserve currency other fiats don't want it the chinese do not want the post-71 system europeans while they had a chance to have it i don't think they do anymore did not want it with the euro the new system that we are transitioning to uh despite gnashing of teeth screaming yelling arguing against it his already 10 plus years underway and that shift that new system is price commodities and in particular energy in multiple currencies so settle trade imbalances in local goods and then net settle in physical gold maybe a little bit of local sovereign government debt a little bit maybe the world bank and the imf talked about this in 2010 and 2011 respectively the pboc talked about this in 2009 the eurozone was talking about this in 1999 and so if people are saying it's going to take decades it's been decades uh the euro the eurozone was really preparing for this in the 70s we're 50 years in and so there's two straw man arguments out there that i just sort of shake my head at which is what fiat's going to replace the dollar none and nobody's trying and number two that's going to take decades so we have decades we're decades in so over time this new system will facilitate or drive currencies to trade on relative balance of payments in other words the bigger the deficit the weaker your currency against gold and the the the stronger your the bigger your surplus the the stronger your currency is against gold as the currencies reorder what that looks like is the dollar is the dirtiest dirty shirt uh the sterling is the second dirtiest dirty shirt uh and the yuan and the yen rise significantly against both uh as you reorder to a more balance of payment centric global system that's going to allow rebalancing that everybody needs anyway we keep hearing will the chinese need to consume more um well they'll consume more of their own production if their currency strengthens because commodities will be cheaper to them uh we keep hearing well the us needs to reassure and to be clear i'm one of those voices that can't happen unless we produce more of our own consumption we need a weaker dollar to do that this will facilitate that so this is a win-win-win for sort of everybody it gets the system to where it needs to be the only loser in all of this is debt on a real bait on a real basis and with how how much debt we have debt is going to lose on either a real basis or on a nominal basis but after 40 years of debt winning uh you know debt's got to take its turn in the spanking machine uh from hume how can the u.s prevent d dollarization how much a percentage of global trade conducted outside the dollar is intolerable to u.s interests that's the paradox this isn't iraq this isn't iran this isn't libya this is china and russia world's biggest energy importer world's biggest energy exporter factory of the world biggest country by land mass war or sanctions against china or russia will only massively accelerate d dollarization because inflation will skyrocket globally in war or sanctions against either and that force is more treasury selling to raise dollars uh by the rest of the world it also would necessitate non-dollar settlement on all trade immediately because if you think war or sanctions against china are going to lead china to still accept dollars for all that production they do for our economy uh that strikes me as incredibly naive um it's not what happened in world war ii uh so paradoxically trying to run the sanctions or war playbook against these two because they're so big and interconnected will only accelerate the process of dedolarization of commodities uh the alternative is that the u.s takes the lead and implements industrial policy resures production to restore our economic production vitality and capabilities particularly as it relates to the defense industrial base and that will also promote de-doorization uh around the world and i think that's again we're in the fog of war right now we're between two trapezius whatever metaphor you'd like but i think that's where this movie is going from carmen what do you make of the recent segments on both cnn and fox regarding world reserve dollar status world reserve currency status about the dollar is this mainstream news recognition a signpost for you i think it's very curious i do think it's a potential signpost uh i don't think they got all of the angles right or at least as the way i see them as correct the way the change we've been hypothesizing slash observing uh but the fact they're talking about it i think might be very important because when we start getting u.s multiple us mainstream media channels all pushing a story uh oftentimes there's a reason for it so well let's see it's still early from jordan do you think peak cheap oil is more deflationary than inflationary given that it will destroy paper assets and derivatives over time do you think central bank digital currency is a tool to control inflation by controlling spending as we are approaching the energy cliff how much demand needs to be destroyed uh cheap energy if not offset with a revolutionary energy productivity breakthrough is inflationary in some areas deflationary and others and then i think it depends on the reaction of authorities historically if you look uh anytime energy spend as a percent of gdp gets over sort of mid single digits in the developed world uh it's it's driven a recession and that's in the initially deflationary to your point um if slash as cheap energy is understood to be a secular trend or as authorities print money to avoid sovereign debt default caused by peak cheap energy that's going to drive a secular inflation because investors are going to go wait a second peak jeep energy's real i can't own fixed rate debt i have to get into things that preserve my energy purchasing power and the debt markets are way bigger than any other market so you're going to get debt flows into commodities into gold into bitcoin into equities anything that preserves purchasing power and as that happens that's pretty inflationary uh also as as increased money supplies as peak jeep energy forces authorities uh to print to more fully reserve sovereign debt right you go into recession with debt levels as high sovereign debt levels particularly in the west this high uh authorities have two choices they can default on their sovereign debt or they can print money to to stave that off they almost always do the latter and that's inflationary over time uh cbdc uh yeah i think it could be used to control inflation because it can be used to control people um that's not a happy outcome right that starts to look like uh ussr centralized control of the economy not if not not not a uh uh i'm not a fan of that in theory a lot of demand would need to be destroyed in an energy cliff situation but again meant there's massive levels of debt outstanding that are all based on no energy cliff that an assumption of no energy cliff so an energy cliff with massive levels of debt that were taken out assuming no energy cliff means you either get a huge wall of defaults which initially again is deflationary until sovereign start defaulting which won't take long uh because when sovereign's default remember the sovereign debt essentially backs these fiat currencies so if you have the backing of the currency defaulting shrinking that's the denominator of a fraction shrinking which means the numerator goes toward infinity that's highly inflationary and what that looks like is as sovereign debt is if authorities don't print the money to keep it nominally solvent sovereign debt goes from being risk-free to being risky that's a world no one's ever seen before what do you do in that world you get out of sovereign debt and first thing you go into is gold physical only uh you go into a bitcoin you go into commodities you go into real estate you go into equity anything that does that reduces your counterparty risk and preserves your purchasing power relative to that inflation so that's why i think ultimately an energy cliff while initially deflationary it isn't going to last long it's going to be real hard to trade i prefer to hedge that by simply managing my liquidity not having a lot of leverage and plan for the end game which is very inflationary um i also think it's why holdings overweight reserve at being overweight reserve assets uh in physical form so to speak with that have no counterparty risk is key for this part of the cycle that's physical gold bitcoin held off the exchanges uh maybe even some physical silver as well although there's an industrial component there um since central banks don't own silver uh and then finally rm if you are an ria managing a one million dollar portfolio for a retiree who needs to make a three percent real return for the next 20 years how would you allocate now i'd probably go one percent bitcoin held off exchange i'd go 20 physical gold i'd go ten percent uh treasury tips uh and then i'd probably do 60 in in a variety of different diversified uh balanced equity funds um that are paying healthy dividends and that have some pricing power as sort of their mandate their companies that they own have some some pricing power uh and that have low leverage they have good balance sheets and then i would probably put the last 10 percent into some sort of commodity-based real estate fund uh that invests in farmland or invests in timberland uh i have a good friend of mine who runs a institutional fund that invests in blueberry farms for example it's a good business and those are true inflation hedges there's no fudging the inflation it's based on yields it's based on crop prices uh lumber is very sort of steady and permanent if you manage that so that's how i'd answer that question so that's going to finish up for today if you like these updates check out tree rings fftt dash tree rings.com this week we have a promo going on if you're interested in it 10 most interesting things and what grabbed our attention about them in the and whether they either supported a refuted a way we had previously been thinking about the world a lot of great feedback on it like i said have a promo running this week so with that i'm going to sign off for today as always thank you

you're well hope everybody had a great weekend i know i did i was down in lovely columbia south carolina watching a little college baseball where the marietta pioneers swept the suny cortland red dragon in a three-game series so weather was beautiful it's nice to get some sun which is in short supply in ohio this time of year so with that i'm going to jump right into the update a lot of questions about the banks etc um i think i think the banks are fine i think most of the banks are fine in my view this it's important to take a step back this is a treasury issue this is a united u.s treasury bond issue this is this is the binary outcome we've been talking about for a long time which is there there's no it's not a dial anymore it's a switch it's depression or it's inflation uh powell has to choose does he want to be benjamin strong over tightening into the great depression or does he want to be arthur burns and uh see sustained inflation and if you take a step why i say it's a treasury issue just take a step back again one further which is the two biggest marginal buyers of treasuries over the last eight years really have been the fed and u.s banks the u.s banks over the last eight years and so obviously uh with qt the fed term seller of treasuries the issue is ultimately that the us government is de facto crowding out its own banking system by virtue of running these deficits increasing these deficits uh thanks to the fed raising rates and reducing tax receipts as the fed is trying to fight inflation so this in turn forces banks into a tough spot that we've we've all heard a lot about in the last week which is and not even the last week in last five days which is they either need to raise deposit rates to compete for scarce dollars for funding but that in turn squeezes net interest margins and earnings for banks which is a sub-optimal outcome uh for for banks and and for stock indices more broadly or they need to issue a lot more equity uh to replace uh deposits that walk out the door into the treasury market into money market funds which is essentially a the treasury market to replace that cheap funding this also hurts bank stocks and and bank management net worth or the fed and treasury fed slash treasury uh needs to help the banks by lowering funding costs by either cutting rates the deposit guarantee program whatever you want to call it we saw this weekend or by weakening the dollar which as we saw in october treasury did um treasury helped lower the dollar in our view and we saw immediately over that in the ensuing three months treasury yields came down so that pressure on treasury bonds on banks books lesson obviously if slash when fed treasury does this in our view the release valve then is higher inflation for for all of us some people think the fed will keep tightening despite this and that will ultimately essentially uh send deposits from small and mid-sized banks to just the biggest too big to fail banks i would concede that's possible with that said that's basically burning the furniture in the floor sports to stay warm that's going to lead to these banks joining the fed who is qting selling bonds uh foreigners who with the strong dollar are selling treasury bonds uh treasury who with rising rates and rising interest expense are selling more treasury bonds these banks will in turn if they are have cash calls going on they will sell bonds and lock in losses which is not what they want to do i would suspect but ultimately if you've gone to their head that's that's what they'll do and so you're gonna have all these you know and remember the two biggest marginal buyers of treasuries of the last eight years are fed and banks and they will both turn seller along with the us treasury along with foreigners at a time when the treasury move index uh it's a volatility index is already it went out friday afternoon at 1 40. uh the creator of that index uh back in october said once that thing starts nearing 150 it means the fed's lost control the treasury market so you can see the issue here for in my view it's not a bank issue it's a treasury market issue it's also a political issue um it's easy to say oh the fed's going to keep tightening and they're going to they're gonna uh basically squeeze these small and mid-sized banks out of business and send the deposits to the too big to fail banks take a look around your community take a look at the small and mid-size and regional banks and look at what they fund look at what they support their massive political supporters across the senate across uh this huge political lobby across the house of representatives uh you don't think they'll be on the on the uh on the phone to their congress people i i do then you layer on look at the potential earnings and employment hit if that playbook is followed the squeeze the small mid-size banks out of business send the deposit to the big banks you're going to end up hurting u.s tax receipts you're going to end up hurting u.s stocks you're going to end up probably having more treasury issuance into a world where again your two biggest buyers of treasuries fed and banks are going to turn sellers and the treasury is going to be increasing the pace at which they're selling it it brought up the question is this the pivot i think the treasury pivot was as we've talked about was in october and in my opinion yeah this is the fed's pivot do i think this is a lehman or a bear stearns moment as somebody asked no i don't i think this is a re-acceleration of the secular inflation nation that has been baked in the cake since uh coven was dealt with the way it was dealt with the fed's the only balance sheet able to supply the needed liquidity regardless of whether they call it qe or not qe or whatever alphabet soup they're calling this this discount window platform lending program whatever it's more dollar liquidity so to me this is i think it's a big moment i think it's a big moment um now that begs the question someone asked is this the time to unbalance the barbell strategy we've been talking about for so long in terms of a lot of cash and short-term treasuries and and then overweight some inflation plays gold gold miners bitcoin etc commodities industrial equities a little bit a little bit but pigs get fat hawks get slaughtered i think it's important to understand our operating environment which is nobody alive in trading has ever seen anything like this on a number of fronts and ways we've talked about before and so it i i would not advise anyone going all in on anything i think it would be very important to maintain cash and liquidity uh because this process is is very political and it's likely to get more political before it gets less political uh particularly when you start layering in wild cards like peak jeep energy what's happening geopolitically etc so uh last question is from cm what speaking of geopolitics what do you make of the reproachment between saudi and iran in terms of power dynamics within opec and versus the rest of the world short term versus long term i'd expect more coordinated policies and higher oil across the curve set par to me i don't have a strong opinion on it yet i think it's very interesting i think it's a very important thing to note especially given the involvement of china in brokering uh that reproachment if if we're to believe what we've seen across the news wires i think it's further interesting with she going to moscow next week on the tales of this announcement uh and reportedly meeting with eu leaders after that so let's just say i'm watching it with great interest it has a potential to be important we'll see no conclusions yet other than this conclusion which is it does not fit with conventional wisdom of the narrative here in the u.s that we get from a lot of the mainstream channels for our news so at any rate i will pause there for today as always thank you

products if you like these updates you love tree rings 10 most interesting things quick synopsis on what grabbed us uh about them and whether they confirm or refute a way we'd previously been thinking

"Basel 3 gold NSFR update, inflation & US bank lending, YCC, & Turkish Lira",2021-03-23 13:00:02+00:00,13,5RdWbRvwetw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdWbRvwetw,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke graham and fftt hope you had a great weekend to know the weather here in northeast ohio was very nice again it's probably been the mildest winter we've had in i don't even know long time so at any rate we're definitely grateful for it i'm going to jump right in and uh so thanks as always for joining us first off from c i read an interesting thread by ted talks macro explaining how china and japan are injecting liquidity in excess of the qt by the fed could this make risk assets way less sensitive to qt than expected could this be the reason why the consensus bear market view has been wrong uh the short answer is yes uh we've been highlighting a version of this uh that's been written about by former fed official kathleen tyson she's referred to it as daisy chain which is uh foreign central banks effectively qeating each other's debt uh basically uh to ensure global liquidity levels it seems to have begun in the immediate aftermath of the october over mid-october imf meeting in washington dc last year we wrote about that at the time wrote a bit more about it earlier this year there was a lot of conversation around the dollar uh attendees were saying they were not happy with how strong it was it was putting stress on them putting stress on global sovereign debt markets so uh absolutely the 64 000 question really how long will it continue uh ultimately our view is that it is essential to the united states interests to keep the us dollar moving down now if you've noticed one of the nice side effects of the weaker dollar since october has been very good treasury options particularly over the last month month and a half there's been some comments on twitter lately saying hey look how good these auctions are there's no problem well yeah there's no problem because the dollar fell 12 percent in a month and a quarter excuse me you take that dollar back up you're going to go right back to where we were in third quarter last year when you had the dollar up 10 12 and a quarter which is you had horrible treasury options uh so uh it's very much in the u.s interest and the treasury's interest particularly in a debt ceiling year where things are uh getting a little hairy or may get a little hairy uh as it is particularly given what's happening with the deficit which is blowing out in part due to the increase in interest rates so uh this daisy chain metric this daisy chain uh qe of each other's debt so to speak is a way it could be managed i i think it'll continue to be managed just again because it's it's a matter of national security for the u.s to keep the dollar moving down at this point secondly from jd how does the u.s afford its sovereign debt payment at a terminal fed funds rate of six percent it would be a circa 1.8 trillion dollar interest payment alone on a pro forma basis i'd call it 31 trillion dollars in debt if it would take you to the number one line in the federal budget from the fourth line in 2019 is the talk of six percent just fantasy or do they totally slash spending medicare welfare uh in my opinion this is the most important question that very few people are asking or thinking about yet at this point you right now we're still in this sort of uh phase where most analysts policy makers are kind of they see a hot inflation number we sort of recite almost religiously well fed's just gonna have to raise more oops hot inflation good jobs good ism good but fed's just gonna have to raise more it's like it's like an incantation in church from when i was a kid uh nobody's doing the math yet i think more people are going to start doing the math that one coming months um six percent is a trillion eight pro forma um that would be about 38 percent of all-time record tax receipts would would 1.8 trillion and tax receipts are already falling and those tax receipts are heavily dependent on asset prices so my understanding and i if i recall correctly and i could be called recalling incorrectly so take this with a block assault but if i recall correctly once you get interest expense above 40 percent of tax receipts in highly levered um emerging market sovereign debt situations uh you start to have conditions for a real crisis for a real currency crisis a balance of payments crisis which again in the united states would look like what we've talked about before either the dollar goes down and then we get high liquidity high inflation etc or if the dollar's going up we get dollar up everything else down until either the system collapses or the dollar is brought down by the fed by treasury etc uh the 1.8 trillion in pro form of interest would be the us government increasing deficits to pay interest uh i'm assuming they would not slash defense spending i'm assuming they would not slash entitlement spending because that would just increase the deficit and counter cyclical spending so you're basically talking about um interest turning into a fiscal stimulus package of sorts which is a really weird way to think about it so um you could see it just starts to spin on itself so um i think once more investors start just asking this question there's there's really again it's this religious incantation of well the fed's just gonna have to do more i don't think we're that far from someone going hey you know so the little boy looking at the naked emperor going can they afford six percent can they afford to keep going i think once that question starts being asked and thought about with a little more uh rigor uh i think it's to be really good for gold it could be really good for bitcoin and get somebody really good for commodities uh i think it's probably good for stocks broadly speaking um okay next question from se given the two stark outcomes that lie ahead of us depression or face peeling inflation uh per a tweet i put out the other day that i point people toward and given that so much depends on which we get how do we as early as possible discern which i mean there's a ton writing on this how to construct a diy depression versus inflation meter and then in a related question i'm going to answer them both uh because they're related from sp you recently stated a base case is either a melt up or off the cliff what is the probability we get one or both in 2023 and what sign should investors look for over the coming months i think it's it's going to be really important to take a step back uh you know i think first off watch the dollar okay if dollars going up where things are bad things are going to happen if it's going down good things are going to happen that's sort of a very oversimplified way of looking at it i do think though for the vast majority of investors what appears to be coming at an accelerating pace is likely to be untradable in my opinion uh we saw volatility and fx and in sovereign debt at levels pretty much no one in their careers had ever seen last year it could get more pronounced uh i expect it to get more pronounced in coming quarters and over the next couple years uh and and as such i think the the the way most investors should approach this unleveraged diversified with a with sort of a barbell approach is how i'm personally doing i've got cash short-term treasuries that i'm overweight and i've got gold bitcoin industrial commodities energy commodities uh or industrial equities and and energy related commodities uh that i'm overweight um we're not trying to get rich here through this uh no one alive has ever seen or lived or traded through this uh and so we're an uncharted territory we're trying to survive here so uh we make a little money great but it's about it's about surviving um because i expect the volatility in areas we've really never seen volatility we've never lived through before fx volatility reserve currency volatility sovereign debt volatility uh i mean no one alive trading has ever seen treasury sell off more than stocks it happened last year by a lot that's exactly the kind of thing i i mean and expect the one thing i do feel strongly about is i just i'm allergic to duration longer dated bonds i just yes they can work yes they have worked year to date it to me it's picking up nickels in front of a steamroller for the average investor leverage and concentration in positions um in my view just you take an unnecessary risk so continue to have high conviction in the end game which is significant inflation for a sustained period of time but we just don't know the path and with what's happening politically geopolitically um energy wise you know in my opinion it's important to have that unlevered diversified sort of barbell approach in my case um to make sure to make sure we get through to make sure we don't get carried out i think that's the most important thing it's just such a unique time uh next question sb major assumptions you think about when assessing rising costs of medicare my big item is that demographic changes are going to increase cost of of care growth rates and current actuarial models may not reflect it sufficiently i tend to look at it simplistically as a generalist uh it being these entitlement costs so i look at how fast it's been growing on trend i make some assumptions relative to cost of living adjustments at cola so that's publicly available right i make some assumptions around enrollment just given demographics i don't get into a lot of details with the actuarials etc uh i am using 12 overall entitlement growth spending for 2023. i i don't think that's incredibly aggressive given a nearly 10 cola rider in social security alone some enrollment on top of it health and human services historically it's been six to nine percent kager that's up in part due to some of the increased costs around covet etc bigger picture i think it's really important to take a step back and really understand the key takeaway from the entitlement side that we've been talking about which is 2.9 3. trillion dollars uh a year cash out effectively an interest expense line item to float the 100 trillion dollars plus an off-balance sheet obligations of these entitlements and critically uh it's important to understand it's effectively debt in a foreign currency it's common to say well the u.s can't have a have a bounce payments problem it always all its debt in its own currency and uh nominally in this case uh it owes inflation adjusting dollars for social security what we just said it's nine percent cost of living adjustment okay so the higher inflation goes the faster that number goes secondly health and human services the other part of that three trillion dollars uh annual cash out this year uh the they don't owe dollars for that they owe health care goods and services that's a foreign currency so uh de facto so uh it makes this entitlement side of things much more akin to weimar german war reparations than most investors would care to admit and that to me is sort of the big picture important takeaway you take a step back i don't want to get bogged down on oh is it 12 is it 10 is it eight does it say the fact is they are growing faster than gdp they have been growing faster than gdp and they are inflation adjusting basically owed enough in what is effectively a foreign currency uh from bd thoughts on inflation also i'm irresponsibly long physical gold silver if fed keeps hiking do they think the metals get beat down it's been so frustrating because metals can't seem to catch the bid they deserve i don't know exactly what uh irresponsibly long physical gold silver means i i like physical gold and silver a lot with that said i would not be irresponsibly long anything right now um if it's your definition of irresponsible might be different than mine but my definition of irresponsibly long i wouldn't be irresponsibly along anything right now even gold silver uh we're in uncharted territory uh i want to be overweight gold silver physical uh but it's important and i think ultimately it's going to work but it's a situation where it could not work for a long long time and then work over a weekend 30 years of work 40 years of work uh where you get some sort of reset situation and so i think it's important to have your positions sized in a way that mentally you can survive that and then financially you can survive that uh because i agree it has been it has been frustrating uh but my position sizing are such that i i i don't need the money i have a very strong conviction in how this is going to end up in the end and i can wait you know i'm on lever and then the final question from ac if you have to choose and what asset would you invest in and hold on to throughout the next 12 months having just said how important it is to diversify and how uncomfortable uh not be being overweight and irresponsibly long one era would be having said all that if i had to choose come to my head i would probably want to own uh energy i'd probably want to own energy related and in a particular oil um i think that is setting up to be um i think when you look at the combination of the spr and the us already having run down shale rolling over the costs um the the increase of of of inflation in the u.s shale basins the difficulty of producing more and remember shale's been 90 of global oil production growth over the last 10 years um so it's getting more expensive harder to produce more you've got china coming online um and you've got the potential weaponization of oil as well uh with russia so there's a lot of things there that i think are supportive of it the downside of course would be if you get some sort of period of shut down economic depression etc and that goes right back to my prior point which is we are in uncharted territory if anybody tells you myself included they know exactly what's going to happen next take it with a block of salt for me i like i said i have strong conviction how the end game is going to go but i i i could draw a lot of different paths with a lot of different implications for a portfolio and as a result i want to stay unlevered diversified and i do want to stay away from i want to stay away from duration uh long longer longer dated debt so uh at any rate that's it for today as always thank you very much for joining me uh if you enjoy these

"Fiscal stimulus thoughts, YCC, SLR extension, BTC, gold, & commodities",2021-03-08 15:28:59+00:00,16,cCfN-9K6FtM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCfN-9K6FtM,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke graham and fftt hope you are well hope you had a great weekend uh let me jump right into some of the questions appreciate everybody who submitted a question first question is from ww can both the dollar wrecking ball and d dollarization theories be simultaneously correct i think it's a great question it raises a critical point and the answer is absolutely in fact it's really uh what i've been trying to describe a lot a lot of the time i think it's poorly understood that they can both run parallel and can really reflexively back and forth uh reinforce each other at various times so what i mean by that dedolorization of commodities actually drives the dollar up uh and the dollar being driven up drives increased incentive to de-dollarize commodities um and so the easiest way to explain this let's assume that all oil globally tomorrow goes to chinese yuan no more dollars and we'll do this because extremes inform the means right so all all oil globally shifts to yuan overnight so the oil market is globally let's say two and a half trillion dollars for round numbers so two and a half trillion dollar annual trade shifting out of dollars into yuan overnight so we know that based on the dollars uh incumbent status as global reserve currency euro dollar market global dollar debt there's a huge dollar bid outstanding just incipient for interest payments debt service okay so if you take 2.6 trillion dollars in oil market liquidity annually and shifted away from dollars into yuan you're going to take away dollar liquidity to serve that debt fewer dollar supplies consistent dollar bid dollar up at the same time there is very little global demand for yuan little dot little little you on debt china's not been running deficits no euro yuan system you're going to take 2.6 trillion in yuan or liquidity and shove it into you on via oil almost overnight what's going to happen a lot more supply are you on not a lot of demand for you on you want down so you can see the dollarization of commodities from that angle even on smaller amounts all else equal is going to put upward pressure on the dollar now if the dollar rises of its own accord fed hikes rates yelling uh uh cuts liquidity by raising the raising funds in the tga dollar up and we're seeing this live as we speak ghana just did it china's been trying to do it well and and having some success doing it which is dollar up puts pressure on the current accounts of all of these emerging markets around the world so that is going to incentivize them to buy energy in their own currency if they can buy commodities in their own currency if they're if they can because that then frees up dollar liquidity for them to service existing dollar commitments dollar debt so you can see how reflexively one can cause the other one can reinforce the other but can they be simultaneously correct absolutely and that's i keep saying is is if we strengthen the dollar too much you're going to force a choice between completely de-dollarized oil or let your economy collapse for lack of oil because they run out of dollars it's no choice they are going to de-dollarize oil they will come up with other arrangements we have seen that in the last year with the other arrangement russia has made russia's currency was supposed to hyperinflate the ruble was supposed to be rubble instead it was the best performing currency last year other arrangements will be made the top of the stack is not the dollar the top of the stack is energy okay second question sam in your tree tree rings newsletter you wrote that you think treasury is actively working to weaken the dollar what tools do they have to do this uh you've probably seen people talk about the treasury general account tga uh that had been run down it's actually being run back up a little bit in recent week or two uh but it was run down sharply in the fourth quarter that injects dollar liquidity into markets all else equal uh i think there was also some coordination between janet yellen and and foreign allies of the united states uh to try to uh manage the dollar down via monetary policy uh you can see that uh when the bank of japan widened yield curve control uh when the ecb got more aggressive with rate hikes all else equal that helped the uh weaken the dollar the other wild card and all this that is very difficult to know is something called the exchange stabilization fund or esf which is the uh treasury secretary of the treasury can use with the approval of the president really no other oversight as i understand it but i was looking at it recently i didn't realize this from 2013 to 2019 the assets in the esf were around 90 billion dollars between 90 and 100 billion dollars which is pretty significant can be used to manage relative currency rates maintain stability in currency markets which is what and gold markets too by the way which is what it is uh to be used for in 2020 that 90 to 100 billion dollar asset base was flexed up to 676 billion dollars at your end uh that number came down to 232 billion by the end of 2021 no update yet in their year-end balance sheet updates obviously that was to help manage through covid and and market stability but that gives you a sense i i was shocked 676 billion dollars is still a whole lot of money uh even these days with the numbers getting a lot bigger so could the exchange stabilization fund one be used to achieve policy goals for the treasury to get the dollar down that's what its mandate specifically says are they doing that i don't know it's not anything you can track on a real-time basis that i'm aware of so those are some of the things they could do from sb uh can you comment on the reported russian gold sale of 3.6 tons of gold out of their wealth fund uh yeah they ran a budget deficit uh they're spending a lot of money on the war um apparently still running a current account surplus so to me it's unclear why there must be a liquidity mismatch is one explanation so they sold some gold 3.6 tons is i don't know uh it's probably 200 million dollars 150 million dollars i want to say it's 50 60 million dollars a ton off the top of my head uh so um relative to the 1800 tons they have uh officially it's not that much it's entry interesting but it's not particularly noteworthy could just be a cash flow issue again because they're running a current account surplus uh they're they're they're still okay um to me the more interesting question is in light of uh what zoltan pozar wrote about about a month ago uh two months ago i guess now and more importantly what putin economic advisor sergey glazie have said um about three weeks ago in russian language media that was picked up by nobody here by and large um in the mainstream media which was referencing zoltan's work saying listen we need we should we should revalue uh gold for trade uh from for using specifically the example uh going from uh one barrel uh per gram of gold roughly where it trades now to two barrels uh per gram of gold we can use our oil to revalue gold as a reserve so point being is the question is okay was it a cash flow issue they're burning down to to fill in a budget deficit was it a cash flow issue because they're still running a current account surplus so they shouldn't need the cash uh on an on a full-run basis yet um or and then the second question is is it possible that this goal was sold um and received above market proceeds in return in some sort of trial run for what glaziev was talking about who knows we'll see soon enough but there's not enough information on the surface you know the the the the occam's razor explanation is the cash flow issue with the budget deficit not enough information to know beyond that uh from md hey luke do you think that where we have our cash positions will matter in coming years banks brokerage accounts t-bills etc will solvency come into play uh in my opinion no uh if you're in a position to uh if you have the uptown problem of of having more than 250 000 in cash um i i for me i would i would hedge that by staying under the fdic limits that's that's 250 000 bucks um anything under that i don't know that it matters a whole lot uh i don't i'm not worried about solvency type issues that would come into play but that if you do have more than 250 000 in cash i do think that is possibly something to think about um in the early days of a crisis where it to occur you don't want to wait long at that point so that's that's how i would think about that if it was me uh from jg how do we best protect ourselves financially for the coming years thank you for your insight thank you for thank you for for joining uh for me uh it's about balance balance and la uh low leverage would be the two things i would highlight and so look we're in a bursting sovereign first bursting sovereign debt bubble globally in 100 years uh we're at the end of a 50-year currency system and that's not the end of dollar reserve currency to be clear that is a change in the structure of the dollars reserve system that we're watching unfold when you see the us bringing semiconductor fabs back to the u.s that is a complete reversal of the way the system has worked since 71 that is the early days of a change in the structure of the dollar system don't let anybody tell you otherwise we're in peak jeep energy and commodities um and and you've got hundreds of trillions or more in notional value and derivative so no one's ever lived through anything like this before uh i don't know how this is going to play out i think anybody who says they know how it's going to play out it it's going to be really tough to tell the range of outcomes go from extremely happy positive outcome to really really bad outcome and the tails on this are fat they are good chance it could work out fine there's a good chance you know or a fat tail chance it could come out fine is a fat tail chance it could it could be a real disaster so in my opinion when you talk about how do you protect yourself financially through these issues that are very unique historically balance low leverage and then in my opinion you have to start with yourself okay so you need to invest in your own health you're not healthy you've got nothing so that's where you start number two your community uh have a community family friends etc uh best investment i think owning one's own small business entrepreneurship uh is arguably the best investment however that looks uh for the person in question then beyond that point i think you need when you talk about balance i think you need to protect against deflation right that's the dollar cash that's this barbell approach we've been advocating and then also protect against high inflation uh gold bitcoin energy related commodities you be really related commodities some hard assets um that that you know whether that's uh ideally uh with that are that are under or non-leveraged and cash flow positive real estate that i would you know sort of prize real estate things that would that is that is finite in some level they can be rent it out profitably still like infrastructure so i think it's important within all of this to remember that sustained deflation is is highly unlikely to occur because governments will default on their sovereign debt under sustained deflation and no government with a printing press has has really ever ever chooses to default on their debt they usually print the money so that's not to say you won't get these these these periods of deflation but sustained deflation is very highly unlikely under the system we have so it's that's how i think about it for myself it's how i would advise someone to think about it uh in terms of how to position for what a really pretty unique times historically and then the final question is do youth from rc do you think the us government can slash will manipulate initial claim stats as well uh will this bull market run end or be manipulated into a new bull market you know there's a lot of people who use i respect i was just reading one today dr pippa melmgren hi highlighting that world war iii has already started in some levels numerous other commenter commentators i respect uh agree with that view i i think if that's right it's going to be increasingly important for investors to take a very critical eye to every piece of government data that comes out not just the us russia china well china you always have to take with a block of salt but europe every piece of government data will have to be looked at with an increasingly critical eye if we are indeed in sort of this new world war iii soft war cold war scenario and i think it's important in that case to start thinking in terms of each government's motivations because that will give you some idea how they want to color the data right so russia needs oil and gas up okay the u.s needs inflation down they need oil and gas down but they need oil and gas not down so much that it hurts shale they need employment up but they and they need the economy up they you know they need the eu needs energy down they need inflation down uh the u.s wants gold down in a lot of times russia wants gold up uh china needs growth up they need food and inflation down especially food and energy inflation so i think it's important if we continue moving in the direction we seem to be moving to understand and really take a critical eye think critically um what am i reading why am i reading it now what are the government and questions motivations and then always be trying to find an indicator that is harder to be motivated so for example or harder to be manipulated physical oil supplies either our inventories there are paper derivatives but in the end it is a critically needed low elasticity commodity with a very low stock to flow in other words there's not a lot of inventories to chew through shortages show up quickly um excesses show up quickly so that's you know though you know that is the kind of i think bitcoin is a as a read on liquidity that is uh one of the last functioning smoke detectors that's another one so i think it's increasingly important to watch um these government releases from all governments uh as tensions continue to rise with a critical eye it's not to say disbelief at all but just with an increasingly critical eye going forward trying to match it or triangulate it with other data points that you can that that you sort of can hold as your north star in some ways shape or form so with that i'm going to finish up for the night as always if you like these updates please check us out fftt llc.com learn for more information

"Reflationary cycle, Inflationary impulses, UBI, & BTC vs Gold Update",2021-02-17 08:08:41+00:00,14,XHuoFF7ftsg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHuoFF7ftsg,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hi everybody luke grahaman fftt hope you're well hope you're having a great week i'm going to jump right into today's uh to today's uh quick update uh for the first question is from sm what are your thoughts on the recent news that saudi is willing to transact in currencies other than dollars for oil and a follow-on question related by kc if more countries settle their oil exports in china in remnb how does that impact china's domestic consumption most of the commentary that i have seen around these these comments out of saudi since they hit i guess it was yesterday morning they continue to miss the point these comments just completely miss the point uh you need to start with china's balance of payments and work backward from there instead of having to use finite dollars to buy energy they can start buying more of their oil in their own currency that has the ability to increase their trades surplus as they set as they as they buy in yuan instead of dollars the more their trade surplus increases the less of a risk there is of them running out of dollars the more of an ability there is for china to manage the yuan dollar cross rate through energy and commodity markets by adjusting the percentage of oil bought and you want versus the percentage bought in dollars over time that's a side effect number one to be to to be focused on side effect number two is it also structurally reduces china's need for treasuries going forward i gave a presentation about this in 2017. um back then china's fx reserves treasury holdings as a percent of gdp were 26 percent they haven't bought any treasury since and they really haven't bought any net treasuries in any real way since 2011 or 12. so you can see china's need to hold dollars need to hold dollar reserves i.e treasuries shrinks structurally slowly glacially but inevitably as they gain more of an ability to buy energy in their own in their own currency which is absolutely happening uh and and so as this model keeps being rolled out first facilitated first and most by russia which probably has a lot to do with why russia has been public enemy number one for the last eight to nine years uh it's now being quote unquote considered by saudi um is it's likely only to accelerate uh and so if you if if you these are the two key ways uh to look at it um now with this said as i said with grant williams on our on episode four of our shifts happen podcast quote and i said this verbatim now does that mean the dollar crashes well no that depends what it means is if the fed doesn't print the difference between what foreigners china used to buy and what they no longer need to buy because they don't need to store as many treasuries then the dollar goes to the freaking moon and treasure yields start going up which is exactly what we saw last year so i'll be blunt bigger picture any analysis on the whole saudi multi-currency energy dynamic that does not start from a point of addressing number one the balance of payments implications for china particularly as they relate to energy and number two balance of payments implications for the united states as they relate to structural deficits rising while structural foreign official demand for treasuries declining you can take the analysis and throw it in the trash it's useless because those are the two key metrics so that's what i would say on that front we're starting off with a bang i guess today um next question from sh what are your thoughts on the housing market and home builder stocks high cancellation rate from kb homes looming recession high mortgage rates and yet these stocks are up double digit percentages recently i i think by and large they are trading off sequential inflation declines uh declining sequential inflation and the implication for that for interest rates it's basically a fed pivot trade or a fed pause trade you probably have some element of a bounce back from year-end tax selling uh in some of these names and so i think that's what you're seeing go on at the moment from hr given the looming crisis that is at the world's doorstep would you ever consider taking a short-term loan max five years at a fixed rate say at a four and a half percent which you can easily pay off buying gold and silver whenever prices have the correction together with rest of assets uh the short andrews no uh i would not do that personally i would not advise any uh individual investors to do that either the only leverage i've ever sort of carried i guess if you will um by being more by being long gold and silver uh was the 30-year fixed mortgage i held at very low rates uh you know i could have sold gold and silver and paid off my mortgage instead but that kind of leverage i'm fine with uh personally uh any other leverage in that i think it's important to remember look in weimar germany they hyperinflated the currency to zero the gold went to a trillion reich marks uh over four or five year span with that said there were four or five different times where people believe that that that it's different this time and the fiscal situation is not that bad and the rights the brakes bank is going to tighten and they're going to do qt and they're going to strengthen the reichs mark and and for a little bit they did did in fact so much so that four to five separate times you would have lost all of your money if you were levered long gold even as the reichs mark ultimately hyperinflated to zero against that same gold so to me i i just see no need to get cute hold physical gold and a correct percentage for your net worth that you're comfortable with and then let the leverage in the system which is really twofold number one global sovereign debt number two the the gold and silver paper unallocated derivatives that are in the system and let those two massive amounts of leverage work for you when if when the time comes i mean i i have people sometimes ask what's the most levered way to play gold and silver for me i would just hold physical because you've got all the leverage you need in global sovereign debt and in global unallocated derivatives on the underlying um the last step in that process is don't forget to pay off your house or pay it on your debt or whatever it is when you get that type of spike up june 2021 with the crazy run up in bitcoin uh as we wrote the clients in june 2021 sold most of my bitcoin at the time paid off my house uh got back in too soon but i got back in too soon uh largely debt free so um from pl the sentiment of every uh wall street guy is at a recession will occur in a couple months does a 10-year yield downtrend reflect that overly crowding and bearishness i do think recession is a common view held by me as well um i also think that what we're seeing at the long end of the curve is an expression of that view um and i think it's important to kind of take a couple steps back or step back on a couple things as it relates to that view of hey recession weakness deflation by tenure treasuries which is you need to understand or break it down a couple ways for the average investor number one there's a lot of funds across an investment funds across the us across the world that report numbers either monthly or quarterly and in some cases you have a down month or two down months in a row you lose your job so these funds often cannot stand around and wait they have to go with the near-term trend and that can lead to a level of pro-cyclicality maybe we're seeing some of that at work i bring that up because a recession if we have one will quickly put at risk a nominal sovereign default across much of the west including the u.s on either entitlements treasuries dod obligations right i mean it we have a big enough recession either the fed prints the difference or we go to ukraine and say sorry we we got to stop sending you money because we don't have it because tax receipts are falling too much so the odds of that happen at this point seem slim and none and slim just left town in my opinion so uh that's the implication of of a recession with that the gdp this high with deficits the gdp this high at this point in the economic cycle in the u.s specifically the trick of course is path right and figuring out when number two starts to matter doesn't matter yet and that's why you're seeing what we're seeing in the tenure i'll be watching to see when you see tlt start selling off again uh on economic weakness on stock weakness that to me will be i think if you see a resumption of the trend in tlt that we saw last year um with weakness uh that's going to i think be an important tell but we're not seeing that yet i think maybe later this year uh from tw uh why has the dollar been so weak lately and how do you avoid confirmation bias i think it's largely in the short run weakening the u.s inflation expectations driving less fed rate hike expectations combined with some modest sequential tightening from the ecb and boj uh i think you got to take a look back too and go back to october 2022 if you point out uh put a date on a chart in october mid-october 2022 so when janet yellen was at the imf in washington look at the dollar price that day 114. look at the dollar price now and look how quickly it's been a straight line down somebody talked about something at the imf and october 2022 i don't know what it is but i think there's something to that so that's i there seems to maybe be some sort of policy maker finger on the scale shall we say but i can't put more on it than that because i just don't know uh in terms of avoiding confirmation bias uh i i try to avoid that by being able to argue the other side to my views as well as i can argue my own current view and then trying to do the best i can to understand where consensus is along that spectrum because really uh when you make money or when you're making money it's a function of two things number one it's about being right but equally important is positioning uh and it's when you get that holy grail of offsides positioning and then you're right in the other direction that you make the most money uh from d e opinions thoughts on how you think the bank of japan situation will unfold in its consequences with more focus on u.s assets bonds and equities uh short-term uh next few months i think the yen keeps going up against the dollar uh as japanese repatriation of the net international investment position uh happens to to try to help finance japan again yeah we talked in recent tree rings that um tenure jgb's right now there's a 200 basis point pickup versus fx edge 10-year treasury yields for japanese investors as of 10 days ago so there is a an economic case to reach for yield to repatriate flows i think that's good for the yen i think it's bad for the dollar uh to the extent it's bad for the dollar it's actually probably good for treasuries treasury demand treasury yields i think it's not great for u.s risk assets uh all else equal um intermediate term uh if this trend keeps up in my opinion the markets start to get concerned at some point about the sustainability of uh japan's ability to sell foreign assets to finance itself and at that point then i think it resumes bidding the dollar so we'll see what happens uh final question is uh from np what is worse for the west as a whole a slow burn in ukraine or a quick settlement everyone thinks a protracted war is bad for russia and russia only uh i would have said a quick settlement um six months ago 12 months ago four or five months ago um but i think we need to watch commodities here i think the longer they keep going up despite a slowing economy the more a slow burn i think becomes worse for worse for the west than than a quick settlement uh because stagflation as we saw in 2022 is the kiss of death for for western financial systems with sovereign debt at their center when they're as leverage as they are stagflation uh to be blunt introduces risk to the risk-free asset and if the risk-free asset treasuries have risk either duration or credit uh everything else on the board with the exception of maybe gold and the dollar are going to have a pretty rough go of it maybe commodities as well if if uh that leads to continued constraining of supplies so with that i'm going to finish up for the day as always thank you

Live Q&A on Current Market Events [01/26/21],2021-01-28 16:33:14+00:00,55,egCtetdlbXg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egCtetdlbXg,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke grahman fftt hope you had a great holiday and new year happy new year to everybody excited to be back in the saddle if you will and so let's jump right in first question is from bp as inflation slows and gdp doesn't crater doesn't a soft landing look increasingly likely uh in my opinion no uh paradoxically as inflation slows it makes it more likely uh that we get a hard landing uh the the issue ultimately i think is is most market uh observers are not watching where the problem is going to start where it has already started which is at the sovereign level in the west in the u.s specifically since we're the global reserve currency issuer uh i think the fed's remittances to treasuries uh the treasury that we've seen right where it's everything's fine down is a sign that's basically the fed's p l the fed is basically running a borrow short len-long book like a lot of other entities across the globe um you saw the feds remittances it was a binary change everything was great then it wasn't i think we're going to be seeing a lot more of that in the first half of this year uh tax receipts have already begun rolling over november was down 11 percent the comps for the two-year comps for tax receipts get extremely difficult between now and the third quarter of next year um you've got insufficient global but private sector balance sheet to finance u.s deficits already so if the deficits get worse by virtue of falling tax receipts the point here is that things are likely to get much worse much faster than people think as a result of inflation moderating basically inflation is the branch that treasury and by extension the fed we're sitting on and the fed is hacking it all hacking that branch off as fast as they can so it's not going to go well for them in my view the balance sheet point is a point i made on a couple podcasts late last year which is since 1995 anytime u.s federal deficits have been above 20 percent of global gdp growth the fed has been in doing qe um that's how it was 100 of the time until 2022 when us deficits were 32 percent of global gdp growth and the fed didn't monetize them and we saw what happened dollar up treasury's down stocks down real estate down everything else down gold flat if you didn't like 2022 with 32 percent uh usf says a 32 percent of global gdp growth 2023 deficit right now we're annualized at 4q and 1q if you annualize that the us is set to be 72 percent of global gdp growth assuming global gdp growth doesn't fall and so 2023 is setting up to be 22 on steroids and and to me the leading indicator is inflation's rolling over so let's watch and see uh the signs are there uh but that's how i think it's going to go um from jp lots of talk about higher for longer no pivot seems like that can't last thoughts on time frame of something breaking to cause a pivot debt deficits increase in tax receipts are falling uh yeah you're seeing uh you're seeing commercial real estate obviously we saw the gates right at the end of last year and some big real estate funds housing uh the chief economist of the national association of realtors said that housing basically froze in a way it hasn't seen since the covid crisis in november uh but in terms of no pivot uh i would argue and say you probably had a bit of a chicken pivot in october or november in the aftermath of the imf meeting in washington if you look and see the dollar went from 114 to 104 for example uh there was dollar liquidity from somewhere uh when you look and say where uh tga ran down the balance okay so there's one sort of chicken pivot uh reverse repo balances came down a bit another chicken pivot so there was some dollar liquidity injected it was a chicken pippa that really began mid-october um but it wasn't a full pivot and it wasn't fully the fed and it's not sustainable so to your point when does the sort of real show begin uh after this chicken pivot bought them time into year end uh i think the real show starts in one half 23. um again few people are looking at the risk-free asset as the source of trouble western sovereign debt treasury specifically but that's where they need to start um it's not different this time um and with debt and deficits where they are i think we're going to get a binary downtick in the economy as offer side collapses to collapse to bid sides in the borrow shortland long world broadly speaking uh you saw this blackstone deal they did with the university of california pension system eleven and a quarter percent guaranteed rate that's a sign that's a sign things aren't all hunky-dory so i think you get a binary downtick in the economy i think you get the fiscal deterioration and i think it's going to happen relatively quickly uh in a way that surprises people at some point here in the first half and then we'll see what the fed wants to do it'll sort of be a check to them situation from nm mn would you recommend investing now in money market funds as a vehicle to part cash uh yes uh recently moved a portion of my own personal investments into short-term treasuries i don't like to short assets in the global sovereign debt crisis because the volatility has been inhumane i think it's going to get worse um and we have a pretty strong conviction how the game's going to end which is you want to own risk assets in a global sovereign debt crisis because central banks cannot let the sovereign become nominally insolvent go bankrupt miss coupon payments etc so they ultimately do print the money historically but volatility in the short rain has been inhumane is likely to remain inhumane i'm a terrible options trader and i know that about myself so i just don't play there and so when i see heightened risk i prefer to play it as go to cash and wait and so that's what part of that incremental move was in terms of moving some of our money into money market funds um to park and wait and see what happens uh from uh d some believe that the wealth effect in housing not so much stocks is responsible for propping up the economy this cycle if so and housing doesn't correct how does this affect fed pivot and recession outlook uh i would say the california experience last year would argue otherwise uh going from a 100 billion dollar surplus to a 25 billion deficit in the span of about eight months uh with stocks again housing hasn't really fallen yet so that's largely stocks and at any rate in my opinion housing is going to start to correct probably in the latter part of the first half of this year maybe more quickly again i point you to north north excuse me the national association of realtors chief economists uh lawrence young saying the market froze the housing market in the united states froze in november in a way he hadn't seen since the depths of the covid crisis freezing is the first step what comes after freezing or offer sides collapsing to bid sides what's the catalyst for that people need to move um price markdowns can happen for any reason if for no other reason every every day whatever it is ten thousand baby boomers turning 60. uh then it's a 10 000 are also turning 70. uh if as they move into uh care facilities or assisted living uh or die and their kids get the house are boomers kids likely to sit on a house and wait for best price if it's fully owned are they likely to hit the bid and get the cash and my guess is you'll start to see you know more on the margin hit the bid get the cash from the kids and as that happens that could prove to be a catalyst again just demographics so and once that happens that's you know once price is broken in one house couple transactions the comparables the comparables are the comparables and then if you want to move your place you got to go to the comparable in a lot of cases unless liquidity is freed up unless the fed pivots so i think again it filters into this view that inflation was the branch the fed and treasure we were sitting on and reduced inflation is going to lead to a i think pretty binary uh slow down in the economy in the first half of this year uh from zbd give us your specific thoughts on the zoltan pieces last week please uh in short i think he's correct i i think he's brilliant i think he's correct uh it's obviously something fftt has been writing about for a long time uh nearly eight years in terms of gold oil china's need to move to yuan pricing of oil as a matter of national security um and and we've been highlighting the ways in which they've been doing that i do think there are parts um i would point to within that in terms of the encumbrance of commodities where i think china is much further along than um than a lot of people think in that process um i also think it's no worthy you know 10 is a former fed treasury official and he's one of the foremost experts on monetary plumbing in the world and so i think it's important that someone as as sharp and and astute as zoltan is and has been historically is highlighting this so um you know it's something i think that was a very important signpost or mile marker in this process uh from dl please elaborate on your wti us dollar spr tweet uh in your video uh yeah i tweeted yesterday highlighting the gap between the spr strategic petroleum reserve which is plummeting almost vertically down and us wti which is west texas intermediate oil which is holding up uh after they had followed each other uh reasonably tightly for the last 32 or 33 years my point was that when an emerging market sees its currency weakening versus the dollar while that emerging markets fx reserves are plummeting it's a sign that the currency is going to to weaken markedly versus the dollar in an em versus dollar quote market usually market weakening would be the currency that currency getting uh a higher number against the dollar weakening against the dollar in the case of the oil tweet uh the sign it would be a sign that the oil number uh is uh could could rise markedly against the dollar so obviously if the oil number rises markedly against the dollar that's a sign oil prices going up against the dollar and then finally from sp given your 2023 outlook uh is for the beginning of the end to start this year up at the beginning of the end or just a change i would say it's it's just a change these things change with regularity particularly on the long cycle so at any rate what's your year-end price target for gold i think gold sets new all-time highs at some point 2023. so with that i'm going to finish up for tonight as

"Gold in 2021, Fed policy, BTC, Energy, US Inflation",2021-01-05 09:34:59+00:00,15,5f65PZinSUg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f65PZinSUg,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke grahman fftt hope you had a great weekend this will be the final uh bi-weekly episode of 2022 so let's jump right in uh first question from jm what's to stop them from inflating away the debt but only to 100 or 95 percent of gdp why is 75 or 80 percent the magic number uh they could try to do that stop there my estimate was 75 to 80 percent was based on the level needed for the fed to be able to normalize policy without quickly blowing things up because that was a conservative estimate of the level of gdp if that the gdp when the fed last did so and i would argue that was in the in the 90s um i say it's conservative because um that the gdp was more like 60 to 70 percent back then so um that is really the key driver is what's the level of debt to gdp needed where the fed can go back to normalizing without causing uh chaos pretty much immediately somewhere and we've seen that that's 2022 we've seen chaos pretty much uh pretty much everywhere but the dollar and energy and gold uh next question from np uh everybody's looking for a fed pivot maybe the global south actually pivots first forcing the develop market nations to react to a new financial or geopolitical reality if this is a non-zero possibility how would one hedge against this a dollar cash and treasuries might not be the best bet in that case uh i agree and i agree that it's a non-zero uh possibility i think it ties into a little bit with what zoltan pozar talked about with russia and gold selling oil for gold the big theme around the world all year is the strong dollars killing people and also they need energy that is also killing people so metaphorically so far i would take and so i would take ghana as an example where they talked about bartering gold for oil as a way of reducing their dollar energy needs um if we separate ghana we separate gold bigger picture um if you see more nations being able slash willing to transact multi-currency uh transacted multi-currency for energy and commodities in particular uh the yuan then that becomes a bit of a game changer over time for the global south in terms of their it reduces their need for energy for dollars for energy dramatically frees up their dollar liquidity buys them time uh and uh everyone and myself included has on the assumption or the bet outright that the u.s will be the last to break due to the strong dollar i i don't know that the us will be last i don't think it's going to be first though uh put it that way given us dollar debt for everyone involved so if the global south were to move to a more multi-polar commodity in a particular energy transactional system that would be basically a pivot of note uh an economically angiopolitically worth noting so let's see if that continues a follow-on question from mn is can you explain the ghana oil for gold trade about which you spoke recently so it was in the news a couple weeks ago for an emerging market there's there's you need dollars principally for two reasons number one uh you if you have debt it's generally dollar denominated debt and number two uh you import generally you import energy um we'll leave some of the energy exporting emerging markets out of this discussion for the moment so if you can reduce you need dollars for both if you can reduce your dollar demands for energy by transacting with an energy supplier in for example gold then that frees up that dollar liquidity to be applied to the dollar debt it's improves your debt position your your liquidity your your liquidity position vis-a-vis your dollar uh obligations in any given year should support your currency as a result of that now you would need to do this deal in most nations cases at an above market gold oil ratio right so if you look at the comex price of gold divided by the 9x price of oil you get a ratio you say that ratio is 25 today if you do that deal at 30 barrels per ounce of gold i would say a russia then all of a sudden you as an emerging market could go short oil futures take the dollars go to the comex buy the gold take the gold take the gold to russia get 30 barrels of oil for that ounce of gold come back cover your oil short at 25 barrels at the comex nymex range and you get five barrels of oil for free purely theoretical but you can quickly see here all of a sudden this gives you the ability to continue growing your economy because you keep getting oil and improve your dollar liquidity which would then free up to make your debt position your the your the servicing of your debt um better and that would improve your currency so it's a very virtuous cycle there will be in theory a lot of people interested in this you need an energy exporter willing to sell outside the dollar obviously we have one of those and one of them in particular being nuclear armed russia so that is the dynamic that is the reason will it be successful that's the theory there's a whole lot of stuff between the theory and then the execution on the ground uh particularly in ghana's case that that may ultimately prevent that but as we continue to see more of this gold for oil gold for oil gold for oil we've been seeing it for 15 years with russia reserving gold by increasing amounts but now you're starting to see you've gone to talk about it until 10 pose our talk about it um there seems to be a perhaps multi-polar energy getting certainly the saudi uh she meeting last week where it was talked about yuan saudi oil for you um there is there's building momentum to multi-currency energy which would as it gains momentum amount to a a pivot by the global south if you will to to use np's words so uh let's see next question jim disaster looks baked in the math of public finances and markets so why does my chart work show so many equities bottoming and some even entering new uptrends perhaps the inevitable recession will be delayed longer than seems possible uh i think it probably depends on sector uh cost of capital has risen pretty meaningfully um and and that's really bad for businesses that are dependent on free money um and it's and it's generally good for uh if for no other reason than a sick than a flows perspective for industrials and cyclicals and i think we're seeing that in in the charts and in the relative outperformance of various sectors uh i will say what i think still think most uh in my opinion are missing and and what is completely different about this cycle versus any other cycle in the past hundred years in the west is that the risk-free asset underpinning every other asset on the board except gold um uh and and silver to a lesser extent physical gold and silver uh the risk-free asset is no longer risk-free if money is no longer free so treasuries this is what i've talked about where treasuries are the risk-free asset but the u.s government's debt and deficit position is so out of whack that they need free money just to keep the wheels on the card so if risk-free if the risk-free asset is now risky and we've seen that this year treasuries the tlt was down more than equities and a big drawdown for equities um and okay early inflation i get it inflation rolled off in the back half of the year sequentially and and treasury sold off more as inflation rolled off which i think was a very very underappreciated important signal but if the risk-free asset is now risky on some level all bets are off uh and so to me uh i expect the high volatility we've seen this year to continue might even get worse in 2023 unless the fed comes in with more qe and ultimately this is why we hold cash a very barbell portfolio of cash gold industrials energy related commodities and some bitcoin uh let's see ow in what ways has your portfolio breakdown changed over the past couple years and what fed decisions would have to be made for you to change it again it's a good question so i sold most of my bitcoin as i think i told everybody and certainly told uh clients in june of 2021 i use those proceeds and paid off my house and i figured worst case out of the whole uh bitcoin position uh my debt removed at my house that's always a good thing regrettably i bought bitcoin back too soon in late 2021 in the first half of 2022 but i think that position is going to work um i it works very well over time i think it's a very highly levered play or high beta way to play uh global cyber debt bubble bursting um stopped recommending big tech as a sector in late 21 early 2022 was another change significantly increased my cash holdings and and recommendation of cash holdings from april 2022 on and continue to do so more recently recommended buying some aaa rated corporate bonds yielding more than five percent uh in amounts up to uh any fixed rate mortgage you might have with a rate below five percent basically making yourself a bank while the availability is there and in terms of what it would take to change my stance as a as a much more explicit fed shift back into illicit qe that would be in essence to finance u.s deficits and or prevent a global economic crisis at the sovereign level ultimately i think they're going to have to do that if they don't want to stand aside in default on either treasury's entitlements or massively slash the defense budget the next question is from gw do you think that the u.s goes back to the gold standard or how do you think the u.s transitions out of u.s treasuries as the reserve asset of the world and realistically could we even begin the transition without spooking the treasury market i don't think we're going back to a gold standard in the us or anywhere in the world i will say global central banks have begun the process of transitioning away from treasuries toward gold over the last nine years showed the chart before uh 270 billion dollars in gold buying 300 billion or so of treasury selling since 3q 14. uh i would say for the u.s to support the move if if the u.s wanted to support the move i would say a very good first step in my opinion would be to indict the safety of treasuries as an fx reserve asset which occurred in february of 2022 earlier this year when we sanctioned or froze russian fx reserves uh everybody around the world holding treasuries as a reserve asset asset took note of that particularly some of the biggest players who might not always be in our good graces um now can we can we begin the transition without spooking uh the treasury market i i think this slow moving transition away from treasuries the fact that foreign central banks stopped buying treasuries eight years ago is the slow-moving gear why we've begun seeing the treasury market get intermittently spooked um most repo rate spike in september 2019 there were regulatory issues or cash flow end of the day big picture that was an issue of too much treasury supply not enough demand um so we started to see a spook there that in march 2020 in the equity crash all of a sudden off the run treasuries no liquidity spook um then again earlier this year i just talked about how treasury sold off more than equities first time in 60 years in a top 20 drawdown in equities show up based on data by michael gaia that we've shown you guys before so um you know you started to see treasury market liquidity uh and volatility get very critical again in september this year we've seen some time bought for that with a dxy the us dollar index go from 114 to 104. uh paradoxically lower dollar given fx hedging costs lower dollar lowers the excuse me increases the fx hedge treasury yield effective to foreign buyers big foreign buyers and so lower dollar is more foreign buying so this move down in the dollar has helped the treasury market a bit we've seen that in lower treasury yields with the lower dollar again it it's paradoxical but it it it's the fx hedging costs really driving marginal flows so i think the market's already spooked so i think it's a slow motion i think it's gonna be another one of these slow motion trends and then sort of all at once some sort of big dynamic happens um where at some point you're going to need gold to be made big enough to take leaps and battles right 260 billion in gold that central banks have bought since 14 who cares right it's true who cares put a zero on the end of it suddenly you're talking about a lot of money a recap of central bank balance sheets that makes a lot of sense so let's let's watch and see but i think it's going to continue to be slow motion um for the time being from sn what do you see for europe in the next five to ten years uh it's a long time horizon i you know for me as with all of us the outlook for europe depends on their choices um choose poorly and i think we're going to see a very weak currency in europe uh and in and in the uk i think places will become a tourist destination for americans and asians um you'll have tax havens within them uh around sort of the current financial centers of europe uh in in london uh it'll be com you know heavily de-industrialized for lack of energy um and and with with factories moving to the u.s into china and other otherwear elsewhere in southeast asia and that's i think what happens if they choose poorly around their energy policy if they they choose wisely i think we'll see their global competitiveness rise i think they'll see an ability to buy energy in their own currency and i think they end up being one of the three major regional reserve currencies in a multi-polar world alongside the dollar and iran um with very high standards of living but if they fail to make the right choice on energy policy which is buy energy in your own currency even if you piss off the americans they're on track for the first option which is it's a sustained decline in living standards unfortunately so um you know we'll see it's been one of my big surprises this year is how short-sighted and um uh how well in european leaders were to choose what is effectively economic suicide around energy policy to try to virtue signal and that's not to play down what's happening in russia in ukraine at all that is it's a tragedy etc um you don't fix a tragedy by killing yourself though and that's what europe's doing so i don't i don't understand that so uh on to the next question uh from ld uh what does the fed's move if something breaks they could spur systemic risk but inflation has come down to just four to five percent uh they're gonna have to rescue it i think in my opinion something big systemic breaking is is the treasury market again we've talked about how they bought time they not so much the fed a little bit with the with the decline in the reverse repo um uh balances but uh treasury in particular with the rundown of pga helped lower the dollar from 114 to 104 took some stress off the treasury market that's buying some time that's not sustainable for all that long so uh my base case is something systemic breaks probably in the first half of 2023 um and and the fed regardless of where inflation is at that moment uh they've got to step in um and and resume qe despite that is is what i think is going to happen uh from sh uh what is the lowest oil can go for any period of time before the whole system fails and it's a really uh i think it's a really good question uh to me the answer in short is the price of oil that takes u.s shale production offline on the margin right so that price is probably 50 to 60 dollars per barrel right now u.s sales depleting the big four basins are depleting at a 5.8 percent per month right right so if if oil falls to a price where you begin to lay down wells in the u.s the marginal well you're going to see um you're gonna basically if they stop growing we're just we're gonna stop drilling for new oil you're going to see u.s shale production fall early days at 5.8 percent per month that's a declining rate of decline so it's not going to decline at you know six percent times 12 months uh 72 percent no it's going to fall it'll probably fall by a third 25 to a third over the course of a full year but what it implies is u.s shale will never retake the 2019 peak again at least not in any investable time horizon um and now you've got the oil supplies from u.s shale which have been 90 percent of global oil supply growth over the last 10 years down 30 percent demand under anything other than a new great depression scenario isn't going to fall anywhere close to 30 percent not even close i mean that's armageddon that's you get the shotguns and the spam and like zombie apocalypse that's so it implies basically u.s shale gets set aside as a defense of the dollar as a political weapon um you get into a scenario or energy up inflation up growth down russia's got a lot more leverage central banks around the world have to sell treasuries aggressively to buy energy like we saw throughout this summer uh their currencies fall rates up dollar up u.s government interest expense surges until interest expense gets too big as a percent of receipts which fall as rates rise non-linear kaboom so i i think 50 to 60 dollars in in oil is a really big number um but the key is the number where the incremental rigs start getting laid down where u.s shale says we're not going to produce anymore and then you set off this this dynamic of the depletion rate eating weight existing production uh and it won't take too long for u.s shield to decline at that rate where the declines in u.s shale production more than offset um more than offset the the decline in demand around the world and again the nature of shale is it's going to be very difficult to get back to 2019 if you stop if that happens for for years obviously right it's in the 2022 we haven't surpassed 2019 uh still uh we're up on the year we're not up as much as a lot of people thought we would be at the beginning of the year so with that i'm going to finish up for today as i mentioned at the start of the podcast this will be the uh or the broadcast this will be the last one of the bi-weekly updates for 22 22. thank you very much for all of your support and for listening

"Sovereign regulations on BTC, risks to FFTT’s “thesis”?, Biden economic policy views, & more",2020-12-14 23:58:04+00:00,14,wyEMJplQNTg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyEMJplQNTg,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hey everyone luke groman fftt hope everybody had a great holiday weekend here in the u.s for thanksgiving weekend hopefully get to see some friends and family enjoy a little relaxation i know we definitely did but all of my boys were home the two older ones at school at college were back in town which is always a really nice family vacation our family family time together which we really enjoyed so with that i'm going to jump right into the questions uh the first one from dan at 4120 in this video i asked neil kashkari president of the minneapolis fed whether the pivot happens when they can't service the debt do you think congress decides the pivot rather than the fed i think it's a really interesting question ultimately uh i do think the fiscal situation dictates here um it's ultimately a balance sheet capacity issue uh and when i say that um what i'm what i'm talking about is these size of the u.s fiscal deficit relative to the incremental global gdp growth and whenever over the last 25 years or so 30 years that we have seen the u.s deficit get too big as a percent of global gdp growth in dollars the fed has had to implement qe we had a chart about this in in recent tree rings had a chart about this recent fftt uh they've done that every time except in 2022 and so uh when i say it's a balance sheet capacity issue when you see what we saw in asset markets in 2022 which was dollar up stocks down bonds down treasuries down housing down bitcoin down everything down there there's u.s needs to finance deficits and the government is not only crowding everything out there's not enough balance sheet capacity to finance deficits even though there was private a big surge of private foreign demand for treasuries de facto it was not enough otherwise the price of treasuries would have gone down uh or excuse me would have gone up yields would have gone down uh and they didn't so particularly in the second half when in the first half of the year you could have made the case okay inflation's accelerating you sell bonds i get it second half of the year you were seeing inflation roll over you've seen the economy roll over and bonds still sold off which is a sign that there was a capacity issue so um when we tie that back to the question if this congress decide to pivot uh we're now in a situation where the deficit is rising way faster than unemployment the deficit is rising way faster than the pace at which inflation is coming down and so i do think the fiscal situation has proxy for congress can decide that can decide the pivot now how could that come you could it could come via political pressure the fed we've all seen this chart of fed remittance to the treasury collapsing massively negative now right so the feds still paying the banks fed's still paying the banks but they're really counting on more money from treasury it you get that chart in front of the wrong congress person uh from the fed's eyes uh from the bank size and it'll be a really interesting conversation why are we still paying the banks why is the fed still paying the banks if uh if the fed's not paying us the government um and that could be one way conceivably how the congress could decide the pivot as a result of the fiscal situation so let's let's see from tim i'm persuaded on the debt energy information inflation etc thesis but i've been both certain and wrong before as have i um you're not alone there if you put your anything's possible hat on how might they change the system to keep a lid on rates over the next five to ten years regulate investors to hold bonds capital controls uh yeah they can do a number of things capital controls and and regulating investors into buying bonds so the regulating investors into buying bonds that's already happened here in the united states it started with bank hqla regulations in 2014 buy more treasuries hold it as high quality liquid assets in a crisis which is something not a lot of people talk about yet it hasn't mattered it's probably not going to matter any time in the immediate future but in a severe crisis high quality liquid asset holdings for banks if the banks need to sell these high quality liquid assets uh to a in a severe crisis guess what they're going to be selling alongside the fed the treasury foreigners treasuries it's very pro-cyclical in that regard so you had hqla regulations um that mandated more bank treasury holdings then in 2015 and 16 you had money market fund reforms that mandated more treasury holdings and so we've already had this the beginnings of this regulate uh domestic audience into buying negative real rate treasuries they could certainly do more with that you could change 401k tax deductions or etc you could just flat out mandate every single 401k's got to own 10 20 30 treasuries uh every single ira pensions etc you can do those things uh in theory i don't think we are at that point uh you could you could you could try a massive one-time wealth tax as a form of capital controls basically you hear all these people say there's nowhere else to go besides the us use that to your advantage slap a giant one-time tax on i don't think politically there's the wherewithal to do that yet but that's something they could do if we're going to wear anything's possible hat you could drive economic collapse in the eu or in asia to drive capital here to finance those deficits more cheaply it's a lot like you know sawing off your leg to uh you know to to try to lose weight uh nominally effective but you bleed out pretty quickly shortly thereafter but again for anything's possible hat uh you can try to gain control of key energy sources resources globally either via proxy you know putting a new yeltsin in russia uh to replace putin or directly um you know that again that's our anything possible half but that gives you more control over energy to run that full out that catch inflation down if you can get an energy inflation down uh you can manage keeping treasury bonds as good as gold for oil uh better if you control more oil so there's a number of different things that could happen the corollary to this is look if if if putin is forced out in a coup and someone very western friendly like a yeltsin uh comes into power that for would force a major rethink in uh how we look at the world uh likewise some of these other metrics which have some puts and takes to them etc so there's nothing is written in stone uh it's it's as it stands now we feel pretty strongly about it but there are a number of things we're looking for economic capital control geopolitical political that would force changes to that so you have to keep an open mind and that's something we're trying to do from mm i'm seeing strength and core industrials for example is companies that make conduit welding supplies and heavy equipment the wheels seem far away from falling off this train any thoughts uh yeah it makes some sense um you've seen some infrastructure uh some infrastructure build um i would imagine heavy mining around electric vehicle metals is probably quite good demand for those types of pieces of equipment you probably i would think have pretty substantial hurricane rebuilding demand going on in those sectors some of those sectors energy production in the u.s is still quite high in theory maybe you're seeing on the margin some reshoring activity i think the economy in the u.s and and more broadly is still very uneven um you're hearing some leading indicators uh historical leading indicators housing multi-family both weakening meaningfully in the non-cash buyer segments right so even within these you know i was talking to a friend of mine the other day hey the high end in a in a in a higher end uh area of the united states um four five six million dollar houses cash buyers are still there things where they are are needing financing that part of the market has slowed meaningfully is what they were telling me uh leading indicators like south korean exports historically a very good leading indicator they're recessionary um that's telling us what's going to come so it's very uneven um i i will say from a personal sample i recently put money into a private equity investment into electrical transmission and distribution equipment which is uh not the the sexiest industry in the world uh but it's a very i think it's it's i think it's going to be a very stable and very important uh with a secular tailwind given ev given infrastructure given restoring and so per you know selfishly to hear you saying uh that you're still hearing good strength in some of those uh related areas um that's makes me happy to hear uh from tm if most if not all companies need to divest from manufacturing from china where does that manufacturing go where regardless of where doesn't that represent a huge cost increase building new plants etc and will pressure inflation for the next day decade uh i'm not convinced that we all does have to leave china or will i'll leave china um i think it's important to note that i think seven of the top 10 container ports in the world are in china and it took them 20 25 years working at the fastest pace in human history uh to do that um and so it's not going to easily be replicable or replicable excuse me and certainly to your point not without massive inflation um i do think you will see people leave oh factories leaving china i do think you'll see redundancies built um i think you're starting to see some signs of that when you talk about semiconductor fabs coming back to the u.s um others obviously may leave i think you'll see some go to vietnam and elsewhere in southeast asia but again there's only so much you can go there the infrastructure is just not there to actually just move the goods you can build a factory but you still got to get it on the roads out of the country um and that i think is more of a lead time than people are giving credit for again you can do it on the margins but wholesale leaving china i just don't think is likely um some of it you still you'll likely see and are seeing it move to to mexico latin america i've been told that that's more soft goods uh that have already been moving there anyway from a cost perspective um some of it may come back to the u.s as we were just talking about particularly some of the stuff around um national security semiconductors etc but to your point totally agree in any case it's all inflationary uh globalization was disinflationary deflationary for labor um deglobalization i think is going to be inflationary and it needs to be very inflationary for labor uh from rc hi luke is the news about ghana paying gold for oil important in your opinion what can the usa do about it i assume they don't like the development uh and a related question from by how would an alternative gold or other aspect currency work as an alternative to the dollar who would trust a brick nation that issued this uh so first off in my opinion yes i think the ghana news is important it depends on the structure of how they ultimately do the deal but it gives ghana the ability to adjust their balance of payments as it relates to energy and that in that way allows them to reduce their dollar outflows and manage their dollar reserves uh it's going to depend on what ratio of gold to oil that they pay in other words uh if if they change the gold to oil ratio relative to the open market then suddenly that gives them another lever with which to manage uh energy uh energy imports and since that's being done done largely in dollars that allows them to manage their dollar position what can the u.s do i would imagine the at least certain interests in the us probably not happy with this arrangement uh you could see the u.s implement sanctions that that's the first thing you would see that would be the first thing you see so let's watch and see what they do there both on potentially ghana and then on the potential energy suppliers on the other side of that transaction one of whom i suspect are already under sanctioned in being russia so in my opinion this gold is not going to be uh or a gold um or other asset-backed currency is not going to be an alternative to the dollar i don't think anyone wants to back their currency with gold per se um however i think it is and has been a growing alternative to treasuries gold that is as a primary reserve asset for the past nine years since we put a chart on twitter last week and since 2014 global central banks have nets sold uh or sold on a net basis 371 billion dollars in treasuries they've bought on net 264 billion dollars in gold uh does a 600 billion dollar swing that's that's starting to be pretty meaningful particularly if at some point ever in the future we do get some sort of revaluation of gold which i suspect is at some point only a matter of time which ties into the last point which is why that i think ultimately is happening has to happen is that in a cheap energy world you have to reserve an asset that maintains its value in energy terms it has to uh if energy prices have to rise secularly uh in order to grow energy supplies as needed to continue to fuel the economic growth to support humanity to support the debt that we've taken on then you're likely to see secular increases in energy prices over time you can't hold as your reserve asset if you're a country and an energy importer western sovereign debt that is going to fall in energy terms um you have to reserve an asset that will keep pace with the rise in energy or else you're going to find yourself unable to afford energy your economy collapses your currency collapses your population collapses you have political problems uh this this is why i think ultimately we've begun seeing and now we're seeing an acceleration in this dynamic over the last eight to nine years which is not buying treasuries on net selling treasuries on net buying gold on net at the global central bank level um ultimately uh gold can rise to adjust uh and maintain purchasing power of nations in energy terms western sovereign debt cannot raise rates enough to keep the debt stable in energy terms at least they can't raise rates enough without bankrupting those same western sovereign so with that i'm going to finish up for the day as always thank you for joining me if you like these updates check out fftt llc.com for more information about tree rings 10 most

"USD Weakness, Potential downside levels for gold,  & US government debt rollover discussion",2020-12-02 11:01:31+00:00,18,FiOqc4FOHf4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiOqc4FOHf4,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hey everybody luke groman fftt hope everybody had a great weekend i know i did i was down at the university of cincinnati my alma mater with my oldest son who actually also goes there we are watching the bearcats play the navy midshipmen and we won uh the bearcats one it was really cool to see how well navy traveled really surprised me a lot of naval navy fans there a lot of cadets there some that we talked to that drove all the way there from annapolis so much respect to those guys uh both for their traveling and for their service most of all so with that we're going to jump right in first off uh from sw previously you said q3 would be the pivot or pause do you have a new pivot or pause timeline uh no clearly uh we were wrong they didn't pause uh by virtue of the rate hike last week many of the things i thought that would happen that would force a pause a happen uh sovereign dislocations that we've seen here to date uh energy markets rolling over at least off the highs uh by a good 20 30 percent uh stocks down uh treasury market uh uh volatility uh however the fed didn't pause in response to those things which surprised me i i still think the u.s fiscal situation will be a trigger i think um a potential trigger may have been the borrowing update from the treasury last week uh when they announced uh a doubling in the annualized deficit over the next six months i don't get the sense a lot of people have noticed that i think it was a very important data release uh all else equal uh if the fed prints enough it'll put downward pressure on the dollar uh basically what it's going to do excuse me much higher deficit is going to put upward pressure on the dollar upward pressure on treasury yields unless uh unless more liquidity comes in from either the fed or the treasury in term there were some other questions about uh what are other potential triggers that could cause a pause or what we may have missed in that call i think you need to see a bigger hit to the economy um the i quite frankly have been surprised that i'm scratching my head a little bit about the atlanta fed gdp number at three plus uh it is what it is it doesn't really make sense to me given some of the other data we're seeing but we'll see how that plays out i i think also uh i think it's noteworthy to note how um the tga or treasury general account the treasury's checking account effectively would be uh has been run down uh in the weeks leading up to the election um that is uh to say that over the last i was apparently um i was told that the tga has been run down by about a hundred billion dollars over the last month or so about 85 billion dollars in a little over a week so that's a lot of dollar liquidity into the system that shame on me i probably should have factored ahead of an election but did not i do think it's important from the standpoint that that there's a finite amount in the tga and as a result we should get a cleaner read on markets uh post-election because presumably the rundown in the tga that's basically been sterilizing fed qt for a month uh that that rundown down in the tga should begin to be reduced or stop to be to be more direct next question from dg how do you assess sovereign risk when allocating your gold minor positions quote unquote another uh described minors as a near useless investment because gold won't trade for a time which would allow governments slash sovereigns to craft new legislation on gold mining profits taking most of the upside away for me i think if you want to own gold you should own gold physical metal held out of the system in private storage facilities that are around the world around the u.s uh i do have a good sized gold miner portfolio as well my base case is that there isn't going to be seizures uh or uh nationalizations in the anglo-american sphere in particular i think that risk is higher in other jurisdictions uh however i do think there is a tail risk uh that you could have your upside capped by the governments uh even in the anglo-american judiciary nations uh by that i mean let's say we wake up gold's repriced at five thousand dollars per ounce uh the next or the the first fifteen hundred dollars uh so call it to three thousand would accrue to the minor everything else above that would accrue to the government um i i think that's a tail risk that is not my base case and i think crit's critical to note that it that level uh or even levels below that where the cap price would be the leverage to the miners would be extremely high and so it'd still be very favorable for the miners uh i just think it's something as you think about allocations uh it is something to consider i think it is a tail risk and we have seen some things obviously um uh in canada in particular in the last year that um have changed certainly my view uh on uh how big a tail risk that is i would say the tail got a little fatter uh on that for different canadian properties i still think i still think it is a a far out tail risk uh so uh from ls what are your thoughts on the outlook for uranium miners compared to oil and gas equities over the next decade any other energy sources you're particularly bullish on i don't have any opinion on the uranium miners against oil and gas i've simply never spent the needed amount of time to understand that business well enough i do think energy broadly defined is a secular outperformer in coming years due to peak cheap energy in the fossil fuel sector it will should it should drag all sources of energy higher as long as you don't have a really really um apocalyptic view of the future uh because energy demand should continue to rise in coming years um and so for me i like energy broadly to find nuclear uranium fossil fuels coal ag electric vehicle metals uh and then i think too the neutral reserve assets that serve as effective stores of energy preservers of energy purchasing power which historically have been gold and i think bitcoin fits that as well from pm is it a good time to get into long data treasury bonds and how do you see their performance in the next few years has the bond era ended for good i do not think the bond era has ended for good um but i think it's i don't think it's time yet to be buying them with an important caveat for me if if i had a mortgage at a low rate for example if you in the last a year and a half last year at this time to earlier if you were able to get into a mortgage with a fixed rate of 2 2.75 three percent something like that uh then i think it would make some sense to take some portion of or all of your mortgage principle or property principle and put it into treasuries long-dated treasuries at a rate above the rate of your mortgage and you can basically make yourself a bank earn a positive spread that to me uh to the extent you're doing that that to me makes sense to own treasury other than that to me they it still doesn't make sense yet because right now the only way given where debt is deficits are the only way they can be made money good is uh by either having those treasuries restructured or having the fed increase uh qe again and so if the fed increases qe or the treasury does um a uh a buyback or there's some basically uh liquidity injection um yes i think treasuries could go up absolutely with that said it's a sub-optimal expression of that increased liquidity uh to own to to to to to play that by buying long-dated treasuries to me the the other the better ways of doing it owning gold owning bitcoin owning commodities owning industrial some of the things we've been talking about so uh what would make me want to be much more bullish on treasuries if if we get the sense that the us government was set to slash uh u.s defense spending slash u.s entitlement spending by 30 40 percent big big numbers which i think has virtually zero chance of happening but if they were to do that then i think you have to start thinking about um then i think longer term treasuries make a a great deal of sense because now you're looking at a system where at least in the short run um the us government would be willing to impart significant pain on the economy significant pain on itself in order to preserve the real value of the bond market for a little bit longer those kind of cuts would create bigger problems down the road but one step at a time if they did that then that's that's the kind of thing it would take for me to get more interested in treasuries on their own to the detriment of other uh other assets from np everyone is focused on a fed pivot other pivots include entered oil energy production strikes due to geopolitics or china opening up fully reopening up fully among others does the fed still have primacy in directing the play or is this now a three-body problem it's a good question um i think it's now a three-body problem i you've got energy and spot energy shortages in parts of the u.s uh or in the eu would indict sovereign debt uh or debt markets debt markets more broadly uh in in some capacity that would represent sort of a change of the rules versus just fed having primacy to the rules of the game uh olaf schultz visiting in china uh you're seeing she uh uh china's she uh make plans to go to saudi arabia you see opec cuts at a time when the us was asking opec not to cut um these are these are rule changes that in my view point to it being more of a three body type problem uh that the fed is no longer sort of the sole decider of how things are going to go uh i think petroleum geology gets a say uh us big four shale production needs to rise by 400 000 barrels per day per month give or take just to stay flat um compounding interest gets us say uh when you've got energy issues and you've got that the gdp this high deficit issues is high so i think there are other factors at play than just the fed and so i think it's a it's a good point uh that you make their np and then from nt with us dollar relatively high across all markets what are the chances the fed keeps increasing without breaking the stock market in real economy also if fed keeps increasing rates would we see another 2008 real estate drawdown in my opinion the odds that the fed can just keep going and strengthening uh strengthening raising rates driving the dollar higher in part i without breaking something uh domestically stock market and real economy are very low um with that said i i as it relates to the real estate question um i don't think the problems are centered in real estate i think the problems are centered at the sovereign level so i think you're already seeing strains in a global sovereign debt markets the volatility in the treasury market being as elevated it is this is where i think the issues are you're seeing it in what they say called duration right it's it's the bond market is sold off it's almost alteration it's not spreads it's it's it's duration it's the underlying which is what they're effectively saying is the issue is at the sovereign debt level so with that said higher rates because duration is selling off is not good for interest rate sensitive asset classes like housing residential real estate so i don't want to leave you the impression it's it won't be problematic i don't think a lot of the um i think it's very different than it was in 2008 in terms of of some of the um some of the craziness is no longer there you don't have the ninja loans no income no job loans uh low doc loans that you had leading up to 2008 they are much more robustly underwritten so i don't think i don't think it's the same problem there i don't think that's where the center of the problem is going to be but that's not to say you won't see housing and and related markets suffer if the fed doesn't if the fed keeps tightening i think you will so at any rate with that i'm going to finish up for today as always i appreciate you

"Fed policy, bond markets, US balance of payments, and more",2020-11-16 19:00:01+00:00,11,0o7zPPzyow4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o7zPPzyow4,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hey everybody luke graham and fftt hope everybody had a great weekend it was a beautiful one here in ohio uh i think might be the last warm weather for quite a while i hope i'm wrong but i suspect i'm not so at any rate let me jump right into the questions thank you to everybody for uh submitting questions always really appreciate it it's always great to have this conversation for the first question i'd be please elaborate on what exactly made you recently increase your estimation of the probability of the fed having become weaponized in the war against russia and others for me it's really been about the lack of the fed's response to the combination of treasury market dysfunction and weakening u.s data uh series various data series along with weakening leading inflation indicators so you see falling used car prices uh you're seeing uh softening industrial data series and again this treasury market stress where it is these are all things that the fed has responded to in almost a pavlovian manner for really the entirety of the post great financial crisis era and they're not responding and so to me that is really it i mean it's you're seeing the weakening inflation on the if they wanted to they could i think spend that as reason enough to pause and that's why from kp i listened to a macro view podcast in which you were asked what would luke do if he was in charge of monetary policy in your response you seem to think that the fed could gradually reduce debt to gdp by several cycles of type then ease to reduce debt levels below uh banana republic level status do you really think the fed has the tools or the ability to keep inflation in check what if the us government's forced to print domestically to keep the guns and pitchforks at bay as all our outsourced economy especially energy becomes too expensive excuse me the printing will be the response to rising inflation not the cause the fed has the tools but they can do only one of two things at the end of the day they can control the quantity of money or they can control the price of money that's it uh price and money is just interest rates and so if the price the challenges right now they're trying to control the mod the quantity of money and they're letting the price of money go if the price of money gets too high the us government goes bankrupt that's just that's just the math and in my opinion that'll never be allowed uh to happen so the question then is really that we're all trying to figure out is what number is that that's the first question and and i think that number is not too far from here the second question which in the immediate in the long run doesn't matter in the immediate term or if you're a trader or you're trying to figure out when they're going to pivot it matters a lot what number does the fed think that is and in my opinion the fed is overestimating how high they can go how high that number is because they are underestimating yet again uh second order effects of what they're doing which they have consistently done it's what they do uh it's it's like the geico commercial so do they have the tools yes will it be inflationary yes if they didn't want inflation we shouldn't have done a lot of the stuff we've done policy wise the the inflation is in my opinion baked in the cake once you get that the gdp to 120 percent plus there's two outcomes you restructured the defect the the you restructure the debt slash default or you inflate the debt away that's it that's how this works at the sovereign level um it's worked this way for centuries millennia um it's not going to be any different this time firing a productivity miracle let's see from a.t rishi sunak re warns uk faces profound economic challenge as he wins race to become prime minister what do you think this will look like for everyday folk in the uk i hate to be blunt i hate to bear bad news but i think it's higher rates higher inflation and higher unemployment unfortunately uh from gw will the bank of england be able to save the pound from dollar parity with another rate rise which major reserve currency breaks its sovereign nation first in the current macro climate uh in my opinion the bank of england will not be able to avoid parity over time with the dollar just by raising rates uh without fixing their energy deficit fundamentally they are short energy it's like owing debt in another currency and the weaker uh they make their economy the weaker they make their currency um it there's either way it's bad for them they can weaken the currency then they're gonna have more expensive energy they're gonna need to print more power more sterling or they can strengthen their currency weaken their economy you sort of get to the same place you've got a it's a it's a classic emerging market over indebted emerging market problem unfortunately which one is first which which reserve currency or which which sdr currency is first i think the the uk and eu by virtue of having the low reserves that they have two months of import cover for those two 16 months of import cover for the japanese the japanese can sell a lot more treasuries a lot more dollars to defend their currency not that it's working not that it will work but they have time that the uk and the eu simply don't and so let's see next question ao if your hypothesis about sovereign debt levels and resulting central bank intervention is correct why do you think the market has so failed to price in future stimulus is the market saying the fed has been weaponized or has it really miscalculated this uh i think it's important i think it's largely because a significant percentage of market participants they really are are being dictated to by monthly mandates quarterly mandates particularly as you get to your end um and so when you're talking about something four months out six months out i just think that there is not uh the um a lot of market participants simply can't worry about that they have to trade what's in front of them today um so we'll see um this this last week of last several days uh rise in asset prices and stock prices i i right now i still think it's a counter trend rally but that might be that might be the first sign that it is starting to price in future stimulus so so we'll see uh and then the final questions uh from from lauren in your shifts happen number three interview with grant williams last week you say why on god's green earth would i buy treasuries if the us government is promising to buy oil at eighty dollars i'd have to be a i wasn't mincing words and that one was i uh can you please explain this comment in greater detail thank you the short version of it is why would you own the bonds of a government that with the other hand is printing money to buy commodities i mean if to me when people show you who they are believe them right uh the government show you they they they want commodities down but not that much they they want inflation down but not that much um they're telling you they're gonna print money if oil goes below 80 and so in my opinion not just the in the the you know the the signal itself the effect itself of buying oil at 80 is that highly inflationary not really um not really to me from a signal standpoint the government's telling you the bar they're not going to let oil fall they're going to buy oil at 80. um which you know to me i just think from a signaling impact is really important um you know basically in my opinion it's a it's a big inflationary signal that they have they do not have an interest in letting things collapse chaotically which is really what you would in my opinion need to do to get oil to fall dramatically uh given the global oil supply situation peak cheap energy situation that we've long been discussing where uh resources incremental resources keep getting more and more expensive so with that i'm going to wrap up for tonight as always thank you very much for joining me uh if you like these updates would like to see more of this type of information should check out our fftt tree rings product and the 10 most interesting things what grabbed our attention about them how they may fit or refute a way we had previously been thinking about the world uh and as always everybody have a great rest of the week look forward to

[music] hello everybody luke graham and fftt hope you're well hope you had a great weekend gonna jump right in thank you in advance for all the questions really appreciate it first question is from jd as we seemingly move closer to a pivot i noticed that the pivot equals stocks and risk assets soar viewpoint has become the consensus in my experience that suggests something else may happen any thoughts yeah there's i think there's a couple of things that could happen i unfortunately um stocks you the fed could make another mistake in which case i think you get stocks down big bonds down big you get systemic threats uh global supply chain re-break down because you're talking about european factories shutting down already i think that's going to further complicate supply chains uh in the next three to six months uh that re that puts more inflation under uh the system that less um basically you could get a complete economic catastrophe i think you also geopolitically could have something really bad happen or you could have something i won't say really you a big change um you know really good from the standpoint of systemic status quo if you were to beget um a a new leader in russia and or a new leader in china that are much more western friendly um than in those types of major geopolitical shifts could also be something uh to the negative in case of a war to the positive in terms of leadership changes as it relates to status quo those are the things i'm watching for my base case is still at some point they pivot i still think it's much sooner than consensus thanks but let's watch from here from hf can the ongoing uk guilt issues be any kind of a trigger for a natural crisis in my opinion yes absolutely uh you go back to 1997 indonesian rupee thai bot you had currency crises uh they those two uh with the contagion they spread were enough to nearly collapse the system on a nine to ten month lag through russia through the long-term capital man management links despite the fact the system was infinitely less levered infinitely is too strong significantly less levered despite the fact the us was actually running surpluses um versus the deficits we are now that our debt was much smaller uh in my view given how much bigger and and systemic the uk is relative to indonesia and thailand circa 1997. i think that would be a currency crisis or debt crisis out of the uk would be more than enough much faster than nine to ten months to be a trigger for a financial crisis uh from wwe all of the yen euro pound have been falling against the dollar for months i've read that the japanese considered yen at 130 to be a crisis now it's at 145. in your opinion why are they letting this happen why haven't they defended their currencies more up to this point uh it's a great question i don't know um i don't know if there's pressure from washington d.c or or dogma about russia or um not realizing that effectively they are the collateral damage to what is going on between the west and uh and and and russia uh and russia and china uh perhaps they are working behind the scenes to try to achieve energy sovereignty although i would say that was struck a blow uh where's delta blow two weeks ago with the explosion in the in the pipeline uh north stream pipeline so it's a great question i don't know why they haven't been more aggressive i do think eventually ultimately they will be more aggressive if they have to um but maybe they're just sort of taking minor losses and trying to buy time uh from sc mortgage reits are collapsing they broke through the march 20 lows like hot knife through butter obviously they're leveraged entities how does that fit into your thesis uh i think it fits in to what we've been saying which is until the fed pivots uh everything's gonna keep breaking um i continue to think you either get a fed pivot soon uh or you get risk of very systemic issues stocks down bonds down um or you get some sort of geopolitical escalation uh from rd to what extent is the fed replaying the 2018-19 rate hike pause cut playbook and how will it play out this time in light of any similarities or differences today versus four and three and four years ago i think the one i guess two bigger differences is is number one the russia energy situation uh and how that then flows back into inflation uh and by that i mean if the fed pivots here sends oil higher that's basically handing putin an economic win uh in what is an economic war geopolitical situation uh and that may be causing the fed to wait longer uh i i think as well u.s debt the gdp u.s fiscal uh deficits as a percent of gdp for where we are at this point in the tightening cycle is also very different and that is that the us is much more sensitive as our other sovereigns in the aftermath of the covid crisis when you look at a chart of oil versus tlt uh with long the the long u.s treasury long bond etf energy is winning energy's winning against western sovereign debt full stop and so if the fed uh if the fed if the fed pauses and pivots energy is going to energy's gonna run away with it and and that may in some circles be seen as not allowed to happen given the ongoing tensions with russia so maybe that's making them drag their feet um and in my opinion the markets aren't priced for the fed to drag their feet because they've been weaponized against russia if if that becomes consensus i think markets will be way lower than your stock markets and bond markets only thing higher if that comes out if that's the reason will be the dollar in my view the longer um you know i think importantly too the longer we go with the fed not responding to things they've responded to in the past um the more likely it is that the fed has been weaponized against oil against russia and that is all else equal negative for risk uh from ming fed pivot update please uh the the update is is i continue to think that september 30th 2022 fed done raising rates um which gives me about another uh four weeks three and a half weeks i think the next fed meetings november 1st 2nd i think volatility in the treasury market is likely to force them soon if they don't react uh it's gonna be good for volatility it's going to be good for the dollar it's not going to be good for basically anything else global stocks global bonds likely down significantly until then i think energy would probably continue to to hold hold its own uh outperform uh in that situation as well uh from will how has brazil been able to raise rates to 13 with debt to gdp at 80 percent um it's a great question uh i suspect trade surplus around commodities has been a key driver to giving it flexibility to raise rates that high without creating more drastic problems on the interest expense side etc um i i suspect that it would be more problematic if commodities fell and so it's it's a great point something to watch obviously the brazilian real has been a very strong currency this year with kind of an outlier from sr what's your take on alternative assets like fine wine arts or natural gemstones does it make sense to hold them as some form of diversification in the years to come to me that's always a tricky one um for me i think it's if you're gonna do that it should be something you really understand and love or use yourself um otherwise for me when i think about alternatives i like sticking with things i know others are going to want uh art kind of comes and goes wines yeah probably pretty safe um classic cars things like that uh you're pretty safe um you know gold certain types of niche luxury real estate lake houses things like that where there's some sort of finite to us it's things you can use things you know that over time uh people will people will likely want those are the types of alternatives for me i've never been in our i have no strong feeling on it i'm not qualified to talk about it i have seen purse from personal experience some people buy art and then they go to sell it later in their lives and because the tastes change they don't get as much for it as as as as they would have thought so no no that those are my thoughts on it strictly my opinion um let's see from hng would what would be interested in your opinion about the uk and japan and then also about india uh you've got three current account deficit countries uh because of energy in no small part each of them are taking um a slightly different tact i suppose uh the uk and my views in the worst position um i think it's important to start looking at import cover the amount of fx reserves in terms of months of import uh months of imports that they have and so when you look at it that way uh japan has 16 months of imports nfx reserves india has 10 months the uk has two months so i think the uk is in the worst position in an energy crisis india's second japan's third they've got a lot more leeway than uk or the eu um and i think importantly india is also uh starting to move to buy energy in their own currency which i think puts them in better shape than japan setting aside different fundamentals of each of each of the regions i think it's important start looking at these balance of payments metrics and and to me india is in the best shape japan's in the second best shape given how much how much more they have an import resort cover and the uk is in my view in in the worst shape uh they would likely be the first to have the currency crisis in front of japan in front of india i think eu's second and then you know somewhere down the line these others with higher levels of import cover from si is there a single metric where you feel the fed has to stop tightening i.e the dollar dixie at 120 or the 10-year yield at 4.25 percent as examples uh in my opinion it's a treasury market breakdown uh something like 10-year yields go from four percent to six percent in two weeks something like that um it gets disorderly the fed's gonna have to respond to that in my view um we've seen an example of that at the bank of england i think that's i think that's the model uh from np as energy infrastructure continues to disappear uh ukraine getting a hit today by with russian artillery and and missiles uh nordstrom last uh or two weeks ago will financial markets fail first or will the real world or is the answer simply both and we're witnessing witnessing finance get real again um it's a great question uh i guess the way i'd answer it is is war is inflationary obviously there's nothing more inflationary than war and western wealth is incredibly debt-backed as is the global currency system um and so and furthermore western sovereign debt in particular is much higher than than emerging market and eastern sovereign debt in aggregate and so i guess the longer this goes on war that is uh the worse it is for the status quo financial system through the western sovereign debt link uh and particularly for those that don't have production and in particular production of energy production of critical goods and or gold in their reserves as opposed to western sovereign debt so the longer this war goes on the more it disrupts supply chains the worse it is for debt and the worse it is for debt the worse it is all else equal i think for western sovereigns like i said starting with the uk and the eu spreading from there and then finally from k gold nothing is working for it inflation war why uh ultimately i think in the short run it's because real rates have been rising nominal rates have been rising uh quite frankly i think if you look at how if you would have told me rates are going to do what they're gonna do uh at the beginning of this year um and gold would still be at 1700 i would say that's a very good performance um you look at gld over tlt for example gold continues to rise against long-dated treasuries which are their biggest competitor in these in the in the global reserve asset system at the moment um i also think in the medium the long run intermediate to a longer run term um unallocated gold balances have and derivatives have capped the impact of physical demand because you it's fascinating foreigners are selling treasuries at a record pace they're buying gold so in this dollar shortage foreign central banks and aggregate are still buying gold which i think is a very important message uh ultimately the longer this goes on the more i think that gold is going to work when energy is explicitly tied to it as a settlement asset uh i also increasingly think that may happen virtually overnight i think when you go back to 1970 3374 when oil was made big enough if you will to back the dollar to set up the petrodollar system to in essence back the dollar gold prices are excuse me oil prices rose from october 1973 in connection with i think it was the six day war cameras six day war or yom kippur i think it was a six day word anyway october 73 to april 94 74 six months oil was up 400 percent i think that's ultimately how quickly it's going to happen for gold whenever it happens um and if it happened tomorrow i wouldn't be surprised if it happened and two years wouldn't be surprising happened five years i might be a little surprised just given how critical we're seeing things get at the sovereign debt level right now but at any rate that is how i would answer that as always uh if you like these updates check us out fftt llc.com for more information about our product tree rings 10 most interesting things brief synopsis about what grabbed our

[music] [applause] thank you [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fftt hope you had a great weekend before we jump into this week's discussion wanted to highlight that this is bonus week for tree rings we do that twice a year so check out our website fftt llc.com for more information with that we're going to jump right in first question from sk what are your latest thoughts on the timing of a fed pivot i still think they're done hiking um you've got the next fed meeting november 1st and 2nd uh failing a an explicit pivot before then uh i'm not sure people realize how bad this is likely going to get over the next month uh to five weeks you're seeing sovereign credit risk uh in the west accelerating rapidly as we speak and i think that's likely going to continue fx market risk uh and and and sovereign debt risk so with this second question from bt what is it going to take to get the fed to pivot uh 9 30 september 30th is friday and your predictions are playing out as a reminder what we said is we thought the fed would be forced to stop raising rates by the end of 3q 2022 which we wrote back in april which was uh seemed pretty inconceivable then it's seeming less inconceivable it's less inconceivable by the day easy for me to say fed seems willing to let this run into depression do we get a credit event junk is off less than treasuries will stocks crash regardless of pivot at this point we are getting a credit event i think as we speak at the global sovereign debt level uh western sovereign default risk i think if this keeps going at the pace of the last two three weeks i i think you're going to start to see concerns about western sovereign solvency within a few weeks at this pace uh and then it starts to get interesting because western sovereign debt is the risk-free asset that underpins the banking system um and and so while we've seen stocks down 10 percent the last two weeks in total uh already i think we're getting into a situation where the risk of a of an outright crash of sorts uh is elevated until the fed aggressively pivots uh and up to and including some sort of either de facto or outright qe uh from cal will jump debt be what breaks the system causing a fed pivot all right what are your top three things to watch as signs that the system is breaking uh the number one thing and probably the number two and three things quite frankly are u.s treasury market dysfunction uh you're i think that is what is going to break and i think quite frankly when you look at the uh we highlighted this last week in tree ranks when you look at the u.s interest coverage ratio right look at u.s uh true interest expense which are entitlement pay goes plus treasury spending relative to u.s tax receipts it's really just an interest expense versus ebitda metric and if you look at any corporate uh uh any time their interest expenses is more than their ebitda they're a high-risk credit and that's where we the united states government is back to that position uh probably right about now at this moment they were able to get on the good side of that metric by virtue of the everything bubble in 2021 that drove a tax receipt bubble but that uh with that the everything bubble now deflating the tax receipt bubble is deflating as well and you're starting to see signs of that and so to me it really all comes back to the to the treasury market um and and what the dollar is doing is a leading indicator of worsening treasury market dysfunction so the more the dollar goes up the more treasury yields are going to go up four partners as a reminder have in total seven and a half trillion dollars of treasuries that in theory they can sell uh to defend their currencies to get dollars to buy their own currency to defend their currency or to buy energy so treasury market dysfunction is the number one thing right now i think to keep an eye on from ts is the uk facing a genuine currency crisis uh yes they are they are likely going to face falling currency rising energy costs rising rates washington's repeat until they either accelerate their own domestic fracking i know they repealed a fracking ban i don't know they're making a lot of progress on it yet or they find some other miracle energy solution or the uk reaches a day taunt with russia uh and russia then allows the uk to buy energy in their own currency or the uk economically collapses unfortunately either out of significant rate increases to try to stop inflation or insufficient uh rate increases due to runaway inflation so they're they're in a pretty tough spot uh from aj voters swinging to the far right insane energy policies dysfunctional eu leadership what's the end game for europe uh to me it's pretty similar with the uk you either need an energy miracle uh which basically is sort of fusion nuclear fusion commercially rolled out by christmas um or the eu needs to go to russia reach a day taunt agree to buy energy in their own currency uh or again you're gonna be facing the same sort of economic collapse that the uk is facing either by significant rate hikes driving economic recession and resulting economic crisis financial crisis or by virtue of not raising rates enough and you get runaway inflation as you get this feedback loop with energy it's important i think to highlight i retweeted this over the weekend paul krugman was pointing out in the case of the uk it's not a classic currency crisis because the uk or the eu don't own debt really in in another foreign currency and that's nominally true but from from a from a pragmatic standpoint uh energy is serving as the foreign currency that they both owe and cannot print let's see next question from jm with investment grade bonds breaking down through important support levels please touch on the importance of collateral in the global financial system and science to look for which might hint at a collapse so for me i would watch gold uh when gold starts to rise in dollar terms with rising real interest rates and rising nominal interest rates uh that's going to tell you that the risk of systemic collapse is rising um basically at that point you're going to be watching uh it will be a sign that people are getting out of sovereign debt into gold concerns about sovereign debt solvency from k is the uk the next greece uh we wrote to our clients in on on september 7th that the the the pound the euro and the yen to us were very much akin to the indonesian rupee and the thai baht from the 1997 southeast asia crisis that they would experience currency crisis again not in the classic sense that they owed foreign currency debt but that they needed to import significant amounts of energy and that they could not print that energy uh unless they agree to buy that energy in their own currency from russia and others that would require them to de-dollarize their energy imports that would require a reordering of the post-war global order uh basically turning away from the united states otherwise they are likely going to experience currency crises uh akin to a grease akin to uh what southeast asia on the late 1990s which is unfortunate from dr how are you factoring in esg into structuring your portfolio this is only half tongue-in-cheek uh i'm planning for energy shortages because that's what esg is going to do uh we're seeing that in europe you're seeing that in the uk um i've been i've been early uh however i've i bought two wood burning stoves in 2009 or 2010. i have i bought solar panels in 2010 to 2011. uh i've got a backup generator that's on a natural gas line basically if if a bald guy in cleveland had been planning for for five to ten ten years uh for much more expensive energy um it wasn't unforeseeable the policy makers that in in in europe in the uk elsewhere it should have been very obvious to them as well they chose poorly they listened to the wrong people and so uh it is what it is in terms of other ways uh i'm factoring any esg when you see us write about electric vehicle metals i think that is ultimately a nod to esg uh i've also been uh i'm looking at making investment into a uh electric uh transmission and distribution private equity investment i continue to think electrical infrastructure related metals and commodities will do well industrial companies will do well over coming years but again in the short run basically what we're watching in global sovereign debt and fx markets is a boulder that has been started downhill and unless you get a real rule change from the policy makers a substantial rule change uh once that boulder gets rolling it's really hard to stop and that's i think what we're seeing so with that is it for today again uh we're in bonus week for tree rings we do it only twice a year so if you're interested uh tree rings again by way of context 10 most interesting things we write it every friday afternoon tie into have a brief synopsis to each thing about what grabbed our attention about those things how they're making us think about the world either in line with how we were thinking about things prior or differently uh and we've gotten great feedback on it

"Near term USD & gold views, potential causes of inflation, election, potential geopolitical risks",2020-09-29 13:00:07+00:00,11,V6SCcXCNz1s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6SCcXCNz1s,[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope you all had a great long holiday weekend here in the usa for labor day uh i had a great weekend uh first weekend of fall league baseball uh for my middle son so my my wife and youngest son went down to uh watch a couple games which was which was pretty cool so looking forward to seeing more at any rate let's jump into the questions appreciate everybody's questions as usual a lot of great ones i want to get into them okay first i was asked what indicators um do i look at as a quote-unquote shortcut uh for where things may be headed up historically i would say first off it varies based on context historically i've watched things like heavy duty truck net orders as a key early cycle indicator of things turning up or down more increasingly since in recent years i've been watching the stock market as a leading indicator because uh watching stocks where stocks go tells us where the economy is going to go in the last increasingly in the last five to ten years the stock up market effectively has become the us economy uh by virtue of uh the marginal consumption connection um i would also say i watch what the fed's doing vis-a-vis us treasury issuing when the fed buys enough treasuries uh then the dollar goes down risk assets go up economy goes up when the fed does not buy enough treasuries given um everything else then the dollar goes up and risk assets and the economy go down and so for me uh i it varies by context like i said heavy duty truck net orders um it's it's stock prices are a leading indicator of the rest of the economy now and and then what the fed does vis-a-vis buying enough treasuries uh or not buying enough treasuries uh from next questions from vm is the eu and uk looking at hyperinflation given the energy crunch plus all the industrial bailouts and consumer subsidies coming up the pipeline uh hyperinflation's a strong word are they going to see extreme currency weakness versus energy in the dollar at the very ear at the very least uh yeah in my opinion they are and that then creates a very nasty vortex because nobody wants to be the sucker at the card table holding sovereign debt corporate debt yielding two percent when german ppi's 30 um yeah the the the gamble the bond markets have been believing is that the 30 ppi is going back to to zero um it's not going to go back to zero and and people in the bond market needs to be thinking about what if ppi in germany stays at 20 for five years for three years for two years uh do you really want to hold debt that's yielding 1.6 it's it's it's a tough scenario it's great for the dollar it's not good for a lot else it's eventually gonna be really good for gold too probably bitcoin uh from np hi luke has the way the decisions been made that the decisions have been made thus far by western politicians surprise you did you expect them to march this close to the cliff given the madness has the relative weightings and different asset classes you're bullish on changed i am surprised by their decisions and i'm surprised how close to the cliff of economic suicide they've been willing to march and i'm not convinced they haven't take taken one one step off already to be honest um last five months we've been writing to clients that those with longer term time horizons should be building cash while holding uh core positions in gold gold miners commodities especially energy related uh industrial uh uh equities in uh in the us and then um an allocation to bitcoin as well which has obviously not been um that's not done well um trading accounts for the last five months uh most of that time for us we've wanted to mostly hold cash so that is is ultimately um you know maybe some energy as well so that the closer they get to the cliff the more the only thing you want to own for times dollars maybe a little bit energy and then eventually some gold uh let's see here uh from jh might there be strong global capital flows to u.s equities this fall even though the usb and the pe is directionally down even though earnings are down since other equity markets are in bad shape um you know in a word no in my opinion um you get the dollar up you you get what's going on around the world happening i think you're going to get a collapse in u.s equities maybe you get less of a collapse in u.s equities than in other stock markets but remember foreign the u.s equity market is 60 65 percent of global equity market cap all that the milkshake already happened it's past tense we already sucked up all that capital it's here now they need the capital what are they going to do they've got two-thirds of the world's equity market cap is in u.s equities they're going to sell us equities to raise dollars to buy energy to pay down dollar debt so is it possible uh given the currency differentials that u.s equities outperform yeah uh but unless you're putting on some sort of spread trade where you're short foreign equities and pick the right ones by the way and make sure there is liquid etc against u.s equities i i don't think u.s equities do well this fall i think the clouds even though a lot of metrics are oversold the clouds are darkening by the day at this moment so uh at least until the fed officially pivots and critically all of this will force the fed to pivot sooner uh than consensus thinks in my opinion but for the near term storm clouds are getting darker and darker uh from uh from will very curious about your thoughts on the melt-up thesis another 50 percent up from here to all-time highs then deep crash in 2023 macro sure doesn't seem to support it but every time i think the market should do a thing it does the opposite it does it does tend to do that uh i think you need to see the fed officially be forced into pivoting into regrowing their balance sheet or elite or moving in that direction and the leading indicator to that in my opinion is u.s treasury market dysfunction um when you see days like today where you get some weak data where you get risk off after last week's risk off and you get the dollar up and you get treasuries down big look at tlt today it's getting hammered um that's problematic um that cannot be allowed to persist for very long in the fed's eyes um and so we're not there yet but we're getting close to where the fed's gonna have to pivot to maintain uh an orderly market in the treasury market um speaking of that from br what does a treasury market dysfunction look like uh it's it's it's rising treasury yields uh in a softening economy and softening inflation um and and critically rising to levels that are politically inexpedient shall we say which is to say uh it it it hurts the real economy right that the the 10-year treasury yield is basically the real policy rate of the real u.s economy mortgages are based off it in particular uh let's you know you get you get the 10-year at four percent um you're gonna have mortgages six six and a half you're gonna get the leading you know housing side uh shrinking or uh in in a recession uh you're it's gonna be negative for stocks you're gonna have it's gonna be harder on refinancing there's ripple effects ultimately that go back to tax receipts for the us government it's gonna push tax receipts for the us government back below true interest expense and interest expense on the treasury side will be rising to the higher interest rates uh but also remember the entitlement pay goes are still enormous you'll be have receipts back below true interest expense and i think those are the levels where you start to see rates up in the u.s in a recession uh and that risks with that the gdp as high as it is a debt death spiral in the u.s in the eu in japan broadly speaking bursting global sovereign debt bubble that the central banks stepping in to grow their balance sheets into still elevated inflation to stop the bursting global sovereign debt bubble is i think what you need to have a melt up in stocks as the bond market goes oh gosh they're printing money to cap yields give me something that is not being debased let's see uh andrew can you elaborate how a bank or system or the use of gold as a neutral reserve asset will benefit america yeah it's it allows a real-time adjustment to uh to trade or a real-time marketing to market of trade imbalances through currency through the neutral reserve assets so think of it this way we run a deficit against china we the united states want a deficit against china we can just print dollars and send them to china china historically not really that much anymore but historically reinvested um into treasury bonds now they buy stocks and other more finite assets around the world with those so basically we send dollars they buy financial assets so the financial side of the us economy gets super sized uh while the productive side of the chinese economy grows and our productive side our exports manufacturing industrials can't compete with the chinese and so they go away if you have a neutral settlement asset like a bank or like gold that floats in all rates the united states would not be allowed to settle those deficits with china with dollars we would have to sell dollars buy gold or buy bancor send them to china and china would have the bank which would strengthen the yuan weaken the dollar against iran and that would then make american goods more competitive vis-a-vis china it would force the chinese or give the chinese the stronger currency to benefit their consumption uh or drive more consumption more consuming of their own production it would keep more production here in the us and and balance things out and so that when you talk about this existing system having gone as far as it has where we have hollowed out manufacturing uh in the industrial defense base to such a point that it's a national security threat which when we started talking about it five years ago eight years ago people laughed at us nobody's laughing anymore pelosi is going to taiwan she's not there um she's there ultimately about the us industrial defense supply base and how it's been hollowed out and it's not just in semiconductors that it's happened so that's why ultimately this system is good for the us why we need to move in that direction and that is understood at some levels but not broadly yet from dan we know the dollar system is going to implode what are some leading indicators that we're on the final descent as in the la once you're in the last 18 months or so uh that one's actually pretty straightforward when the us dollar super spikes that's that's why you're there it's a very ironic very paradoxical thing the the the milkshake super spike is not woo hoo everything is awesome we're winning it's that's the death throws that's what the death throws of the existing dollar-centric post-71 system looks like is the dollar goes vertical and then gold starts going up and that's how you'll know uh and so let's watch for it um like i said ultimately a transition to this i think that i don't think the u.s is going to lose dollar reserve status i do think the treasury bond is on its way out as primary reserve asset globally from f many americans have large 401k balances and they've logged heavy losses in 2022. many of these folks do not understand the consequences of a sovereign debt crisis would have on their portfolio what options would you consider if you were a 401k investor here i think it's really it would depend on the age of the investor in question i think you need to be cognizant if you have money in the markets that what a global sovereign debt crisis will look like will very likely be a crash in risk assets and then a policy response of sort of super printing followed by a super spike in risk assets except with more inflation so it would really look like a lot like what we saw in covid uh except with more inflation right off the bat in my view and so if that's correct then that's why i say it depends so greatly on the age of the investor if you're close to retirement you need to be aware of liquidity needs when you're going to need cash when you're going to need that money versus your need for growth ultimately as you look out over a 12 24 and beyond month time horizon in my view the greatest challenge is not going to be nominal growth in the portfolio post potential crisis but keeping up with inflation post global sovereign debt crisis um that i think is going to be a much bigger issue to focus on but again it's going i think it will all it will likely be a whoosh down followed by a super spike up with a lot more inflation much quicker than what we saw post uh post coven so with that i'm gonna finish up for today as always thank you very much for joining me really enjoy uh catching up uh if you're interested in learning more about what we're up to if you like
