003: The Most Lifelike AI Voices with Victoria Weller,2023-08-21 16:53:24+00:00,26,xoq5WcPmg7I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoq5WcPmg7I,[music] welcome to pressure points our topic is nvidia earnings they're going to be reporting wednesday february 21st after the market close to say that their expectations are high is an understatement the stock is up 200 plus per over the past year currently has the third largest tech market cap $1.8 trillion uh that's up from 550 billion a year ago so yes expectations are high i'm going to tell you what the price pressure point is is what is the growth rate in calendar 2025 that's where all eyes are going to be focused but before we get into that pressure point i just wanted to tell a little bit about the january quarter that they're reporting and some of their commentary they're likely going to have about calendar 24 in terms of the quarter the street's looking for 236 per revenue growth i suspect that they can exceed that because they've been improving supply that was a key topic they mentioned that 16 times on their previous earnings call about the improvements that they're making with supply they said they will continue to make improvements throughout calendar 24 and that should be a tailwind to revenue despite the law of large numbers and the difficulty to grow i think their commentary about supply improving is going to have a positive impact the street is looking for 66% revenue growth in calendar 24 and i suspect that that will all be in order and you probably will see a slight increase from analyst expectations all that despite the negativity around what's going on in china not only the macro but of course the curbs the restrictions that are being put in these have been applied against nvidia for several quarters they will continue to be applied on the last earnings call that topic came up and the company said that guidance would have been better they didn't really frame it in if not for some of these curbs in china but i think we should expect those to continue as a reminder is that nvidia cannot sell their most advanced uh gpus to china they can sell less advanced gpus to china and so i think when you look at the the big picture relative to the negative of china relative to the positive of what's going on with ai i think that the china piece over the next several years is going to be noise so we're going to jump into the pressure point as i mentioned it's what is the growth rate in calendar 20125 and to put some perspective on this i mentioned that the business is going to grow 23 6% in the january quarter that they're going to announce next week for calendar 24 60% growth for this is revenue and for calendar 2561 16% revenue growth so the street's basically looking for their business to hit the wall in calendar 25 in part large part because of law of large numbers and also just this belief it's hard to imagine that this can continue and when you look at that impact that declining revenue growth rate on what the stock is trading on an earnings multiple it reflects also this belief that investors think that growth is going to hit the wall in calendar 25 so uh currently the street's looking for about 20% earnings growth in calendar 25 i suspect that after they report this quarter those numbers will be revised higher to probably adjusted higher to probably 25% grow grow so think of this as after they report the street's going to be looking for 25% earnings growth and the stock currently trades at 30 times the 2000 calendar 25 earnings so growing uh earnings kind of more or less at the same growth rate as the multiple and that is in contrast to what we see from other companies uh for example google growing earnings at 10 15% and trades at low 20s apple uh growing earnings at 9% trades in the high 20s and so different business with nvidia perceived as much more of a boom and bust versus a stable business like other large cap tech companies but that is basically the pressure point is investors believe this is a boom and bus type of business and i want to make the case that i think that this is not a boom and bus type of business that this business can continue to have uh stability to it and when we uh think about that like how far can this go and how long can this grow i look at one of the comments the first comment from ceo jensen wong on their last earnings call he didn't say anything in the prepared remarks but the first question his uh initial comment was related to kind of how long can this keep going and he said generative ai is the largest ham expansion of software and hardware that we've seen in several decades so then you have to put that comment against izy izy clearheaded when he says that and what we've seen from some other hardware companies like amd for example it would suggest that we're in the early stages of that uh he later has gone on and talked at an event with microsoft about some specifics about why this can continue and why 2025 and beyond can continue to be good and he mentions three key drivers and he says that the the first phase that we're in right now related to ai is the hy scalers the big tech companies building cloud infrastructure and also ai startups and he said we're about halfway through the build the gpu build for those and then he said that the second way which is kind of also just starting out too he refers to as the enterprise wave and he was at microsoft event and he referred to co-pilot at that event but just talked about enterprise applications so this would be anything from like salesforce or um service now or any applications that we're all going to experience using ai in the next several years and he says that is kind of the second wave he describes the third wave as the biggest wave which is heavy industry and i find that hard to believe but i'll just keep going with what he talked about is that uh generative ai will be used with all these industries these kind of fundamentals of society and ultimately be this third and most powerful wave of ai i would add a fourth piece to it this is something that jensen has talked about too which is sovereign ai the concept that countries will build their own ai that will be specific to their intelligence and also their culture and i think those four drivers are part of the reason why i believe that nvidia can grow higher for longer another is just how they're defensible piece this idea is that you know could they see some erosion of their market share from amd or other players coming up at deep water we're invested in companies that are building chips these are longshot opportunities but nvidia still has this a developer toolkit cuda that is essentially a def a piece of defense that keeps their uh their chips in high demand as these developers know how to write for nvidia gpus they want to continue to buy gpus so that's a second reason why this can continue to grow higher for longer is their toolkit and then the third is just the broader concept about what's going on in chips related to ai it has a little bit to do with the uh jensen's first comments about these waves but of course sam alman in his recent commentary that the world needs five to seven trillion in investment in in chips for ai and infrastructure and foundaries he didn't give a time frame it's probably over the next decade but that obviously speaks to how bad the the the or how great the need is for these chips and obviously nvidia is in a great spot relative to that and so i think when you put all that together the light is still uh uh not it still won't fully turn on about 2025 growth after the report this january quarter but i think that there is justification that this company can continue to grow faster for longer what is that growth rate maybe it's 20 25% for the next several years but i think it's measurably higher than the current 16% expectations uh for calendar 20125 so i'll be back to you more after they report the quarter until then on behalf of pressure points bye for now
Deepwaterâ€™s Gene Munster on $NVDA Q2 earnings,2023-08-24 20:34:20+00:00,6,l22nd-ITjPQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l22nd-ITjPQ,welcome to ai depth finder we have three topics today the first is related to some proprietary work that deepwater did in terms of gauging measuring benchmarking which of the four chat bots are the smartest and drum roll turns out that of the 40 questions we asked followed by a series of follow-up prompts that i see these models as basically having similar intelligence and that finding did surprise me i thought grock was not going to score as well just cu it's relatively new to the game but in fact they all are of similar intelligence which begs the question what do you do with that and my conclusion is that actually drifts back to the topic of search and of course google there's been con concerns related to how generative ai is going to impact their search business and my view is if it is in fact these models have similar intelligence that it's not enough for someone to change their search behavior to jump over to let's say open ai when they later this year come out with their search engine basically it's not 10x better than what google is offering and of course google with their 4 billion daily active search users are integrating now generative results within the general search bar and so bottom line is i had a surprising conclusion to our intelligence tests of these models is that that google their search business is in a great place longer term our second topic is related to some other benchmarking that we were doing related uh around the ability of these chat bots the same four chat bots to predict the future and so we don't have the results yet because we just asked for the predictions all these are related to events that are going to happen or questions related to this year and so in the case of the 15 i won't go through all 15 but i'm just highlight a few of them they ranged in topics everything from sports to politics to finance and the a few of them that really uh stuck out to me one was related to the elections if we we asked who is most likely the democratic uh candidate for president this year and of the four uh gemini said it would not answer gemini does not come even close to answering anything that is politically related it's almost comical and then we had claude and gpt both saying maybe it's uh biden and uh in terms of the grock it said that it is not going to be biden and so the takeaway there was some consistency with i think how humans are thinking about this topic is the models are kind of saying this feels like it's generally drifting towards biden but kind of has an up for grabs component to it uh moving forward as far as who do you think will win the next us presidential election uh surprising results here is that gemini of course wouldn't answer the question but gpt and claude both said that they believe biden will win and grock said trump will win maybe that's part of that left or that writer leaning uh grock model that suggested trump will win or maybe it's the odds makers right now are clearly favoring trump to be the next president in terms of the uh piece here it was an example or the takeaway it's an example where humans are gravitating towards trump as a heavy favorite the betting lines are suggesting that where the models are saying that biden is going to be the likely winner so this one's going to be a fun one to watch to see how that prediction plays out the prediction uh that caught my attention the most though was related to china and taiwan were two of the models that being gemini and grock said that they expect china to invade taiwan this year not what i wanted to see and uh the uh i would have expected none of them to have suggested that and is we think about the impact there's another question related to how the markets are going to do in the back half the year specifically some of the biggest tech companies and from uh their perspective uh two of the four models suggest that we're going to see a pretty big pullback in some of the mega caps it happened to be the same ones gemini and grock that predict that china's going to invade taiwan those two models also suggest that we're going to see a pullback of more than 30% in some of the mega caps this year and so uh there's other good ones related to the olympics as they uh progress or as we uh get clarification on these predictions we're going to be sharing with you in on depthfinder how the models are doing on those predictions last topic is related to a smart move by google and apple today to take a step back from open ai's board this of course was because they don't want to have be even more in the crosshairs related to regulation and when you play this forward open ai today is a relatively small company it's going to have a huge grip on our lives in the decades to come and so smart move by apple and um microsoft excuse me apple and microsoft and stepping back from from their roles there i think it also underscores just what a great job those two companies have done over the past decade really to uh keep the business growing despite what has been mounting regulatory pressure on behalf of depth finder i'm jean bye for now
Deepwater's Gene Munster on Apple Event 2023,2023-09-13 18:45:15+00:00,5,8oR2QQPb5ho,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oR2QQPb5ho,welcome to pressure points our topic is google earnings as of this recording shares are down about 2% they've been kind of drifting lower throughout the back half of the earnings call i'll give just a high level of what happened they came in line with revenue and they were about 4% upside in operating income the stock was up a couple percent and then they talked about a margin impact they're pulling forward some hardware products and also a change in depreciation that's going to have a slight negative impact on margins in the september quarter they said to expect it to rebound in december but the stock kind of drifted a little bit based on that comment but uh that has nothing to do with what the pressure point is and the pressure point is related to their search generative experience sge and kind of what's beyond the 10 blue links and before i get into this i just want to give the highest level on google is that i believe this company remains best positioned in ai it is a holding in deep waters titan fund and the reason we believe it's best position is that they're the only company that has the three most important elements one is a model that a large language model their own large language model second is related to advanced silicon with their tpus and last is products that have uh more than a billion daily active users they have six of those and so great distribution so that's the highest level let's jump into the pressure point which is what's beyond the 10 blue links and the bottom line is we did not learn much last quarter they were doing some testing around this uh sge and they said that they're going to roll it out in the us and and i think the uk uh they did that so they've got a lot more data i'm sure many of you have experienced using this but they really didn't say much in terms of what it means they've said that they continue to have great user experience that it continues to have a positive impact on the number of queries and searches that people are doing so engagement is improving but they still really haven't answered the question which is what are you going to do to replace the 10 blue links i believe that openi is going to have a search product this year i don't think a lot of people are going to use it relative to what google has and because ultimately they've got this habitual behavior but they have to cross that bridge in terms of getting to monetization uh they uh went back to a well traveled road to remind investors that there was the same question from desktop to mobile and they successfully navigated that and that was a positive for their business my sense is that this will also be a net positive i think it's going to be a meaningful net positive and through our own deep water testing i think that the intelligence of gemini is on par with chat gpt pretty close to it so it's chat gbt and open ai just isn't good enough it's not 10 times better to get people to pull from google to a competing search platform so that's the the pressure point i do want to make a quick um postcript to the quarter which is related to capex capex was more than expected i believe that capex will continue to be higher than expected for the next uh few years few years that's right this is good for nvidia and a lot of the other hyperscalers and the reason is pretty simple if google decides or any mega cap decides not to spend on capex they'll save let's say a100 billion which is great if that generative ai if ai never ends up coming a fruition save hundred billion doll if they're wrong and they're a three trillion doll market cap company today they're going to get blown out of the water and they're going to be a $500 billion doll market cap company this logic this theme came from deep waters doug clinton so i absolutely agree with you doug on on the reason why we're going to continue to see capex climb higher i bet google ends this year up 70% plus i think the street tomorrow will be up 55% in terms of capex so good news for nvidia and that's a wrap for this episode of pressure points bye for now
"Deepwater's Gene Munster on Tesla Wages, UAW Negotiations",2023-09-15 12:42:45+00:00,6,jLyCL_B6W_U,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLyCL_B6W_U,welcome to deep tech 315 our three topics today are two related to apple other cor businesses doing and then separately we're going to talk about just everything ai and what's going on there and then we'll talk about what's going on with tesla and fsd in china and so going back to the top shares of apple up about 6% following their march results uh after the company had reported the stock was up just before the earnings call around 7% so it's been kind of holding those gains here and i believe that the main reason why the stock is up is that the june quarter guidance was unchanged most people present company included expected them to guide down i was thinking that they would bring june to flat year-over-year from last year uh the street was looking for up a percent and a half i heard some investors talking about the business being down 2% in june and so there's a relief rally related to the june guidance and i think it's speaks to just the strength of apple's products in part because china has shown improvement still down i think down 8% versus 133% in the previous quarter but just the the collective what's going on with the iphone on top of that services up 14% uh show that the business is holding together again up to be projected to be up a couple percent in the june quarter the piece that i kind of goes beyond the importance of everything holding together for the june quarter is that the revenue growth for the back half of the year should continue to improve and does meet the criteria of an acceleration and so in the to put some perspective in the just reported march quarter revenue was down about 4% as i mentioned it'll be up about 2% in june and then probably four and six% for the back half of the year and you put that together that back half of the year up around 3ish perc that's very different than what's happened over the last eight quarters when the business has been on average down 0.3% and so uh this growth is starting to return um it is worth mentioning just over the past couple years apple has a particular has had a particular large fx headwind generally doug and i we don't like talking about fx because sometimes it's a positive and sometimes it's a negative so just kind of it's a wash but one thing that is unique about apple is 60% of their revenue does come from outside of the us and so i think that that has had a little bit of a headwind relative to the past couple years so uh let's keep it simple the business has been flat now we're getting to re acceleration there's been some commentary that the stock is up because of the increased buyback and i just want to give some quick perspective on that i think it plays a little bit into why the stock is up uh the expectations with that they're going to increase it by 90 billion the they did 110 billion and i think that it is testimony to this how much cash this business is generating they're at net cash right now uh this is their debt minus their cash is 57 billion they want to get to zero they've talked about that for many years and i think that they are increasing the buyback in part to try to get there faster get to zero faster net net cash uh neutral faster and uh cfo luca on the call said that even with this bigger buyback the business is just so strong that they will not get to net cash neutral anytime soon and so that was another big takeaway is that even with revenue growth being flattish they're still generating a ton of cash and uh it just feels like the businesses holding together uh nicely services again up 14% china had that slight improvement and it it's not uh spectacular but it's holding together i think that it was a sigh of relief everything you just said jean about business not being as bad as maybe investors feared buybacks really strong i also think none of it really matters for the stock when we think about it for the next two three five years i think the next two three five years for apple is going to be highly dependent on what they ultimately do in ai and that's our second topic i think i think that's the thing uh that everybody's still paying attention to and still wondering about doug i'm g to put you on the spot here uh do you know what tim cook and his prepared marks his first comment was related to on the call i think he referenced the vision pro first and then he mentioned generative ai second i think so in order i'm gna go in reverse order here gener of ai was number four vision pro 3 services number two up 14% number one indonesia record levels so to to run it in the proper order indonesian services were number one and two i think it does speak to just how they want to kind of shift the investor narrative here really focus on some of those higher growth areas and kind of some of the the durability of services before we jump in and talk more about ai i will mention that i was surprised at how often they talked about vision pro it was the the third topic uh cook mentioned that i think it was half the four i thought i said fortune 100 companies uh are 80% of them are testing vision pro which is encouraging that also speaks to at this point the consumer really isn't anywhere to be found when it comes to vision pro i think we've uh have well uh discussed that and it still comes down to these apps that need to get built i'm still a believer on vision pro apple's still uh holding to their belief that this is going to uh play forward uh if i can speak for you doug you're in the camp that this is uh incredible technology but probably isn't going to be a mainstream product correct and i again i would put it in the context of ai vision pro spatial computing you know it's a it's a five or 10 on a scale of 100 where ai is 99 and i think apple needs to realize those priorities i think investors are rightfully uh some investors at least rightfully say why invest all this money in vision pro when you could be spending it on creating incredible ai products because those are going to be the things that really drive the business over the next decade fair and i'm at a 20 by the way in a scale of one 100 and we've got like the mac and the pc at a 20 iphones like at a 50 and and ai close to 100 so let's shift to ai here of course our attention was on that about half the questions on the call had something to do with ai they hit it hard at the top of the call uh cook said at the top that they're going to leverage hardware software services to make better ai products and my reaction to that is of course that makes sense that they're going to do that he also mentioned that privacy is one of their competitive advantages and this is something that you and i have talked about related to apple it is i think to some extent i i generally play the skeptic here um i don't know how much consumers really care about privacy is apple you know the the best or do they brand themselves the most around privacy yes i don't see people leaving meta or google or these other services in droves and saying i don't want those companies to have my data and the reality is those companies google and meta are really the ones that are driving ai forward we really don't know what apple's doing yet with ai and i don't know that the privacy angle is really going to matter all that much in that context yeah there is that debate you've talked in the past about we're in a post- privacy world i think that younger people under 30 are in that post- privacy world i'm 53 i'm in a privacy matters world and so i think uh but you still use google you still use google i do but i think my willingness to give if you just say you have your all of your consumer let's say your uh data around purchase data and i can give it to google to help better train my personal ai agent or i can give it to apple i'm going to give it tole nine out of nine times i think you give it to both i don't think you would say no to one i think you i think you'd give it to both uh yeah for but for me i would opt to give it to apple and no you would give it to both you wouldn't give it to both you would say only apple could have that data i'm confused by that yeah i i i do i do not like sharing my purchase data i like for example that uh apple when i make a transaction with uh tap and pay that it scrambles the some of the details of that transaction so i'm i'm old i agree i'm old but i think that this is this is going to appeal the privacy piece will appeal to a segment it may be a small segment uh it's definitely not everybody i agree under 30 or post privacy but i still think that there is a a sizable market that cares about uh privacy but we we'll keep moving forward because i think that the uh kind of the substance of this is what are we predicting they're going to say in june and what does that mean for where they're going for this down the road it's hard to say what they're going to say in june i feel like every week we get a different report you know they're thinking about partnering with google they're thinking about partnering with open ai it certainly seems that they're going to have to partner with somebody because i don't know that they uh have made enough progress to have their own model at this point and something that we've been talking about is the reality with these found ation models these these models that i think are um approaching general intelligence so models that can do everything not models that are narrow intelligences that do one thing really well there'll be many of those but these foundation models really you look at the landscape it's open ai it's google with gemini it's meta with llama maybe we see xai and uh grock built on x data and maybe even some of the other data from elon's companies those are the ones that seem to have the most unique data apple has a ton of data but i don't think they have a ton of data that's that relevant to build a competitive large language model so first thing i'm curious to see at wwdc is do they announce a partnership do we finally learn who that they uh who they're going to work with and then second is how much are they going to do on their own is it going to be some of the on device stuff or they maybe even going to partner with the third party to do a lot of the onboard on device stuff quickly on that topic is i that was my biggest takeaway from the ai conversation is luca's comment saying that when it comes to data centers they want to do some of themselves and they want to work with third parties and the third parties in this case would be google or microsoft and so i felt like they all but announced they're going to be leveraging someone else's foundation model they may have their own model that they use periodically but that was a little bit of a disappointment for me i wish they would have gone heavy into we're going to build infrastructure we're going to have our own model uh maybe it's the right decision for them to to to partner but i think that uh it felt like the probability of that outcome like you said increased u measurably uh i just one more thought on what i'm expecting i think that it's going to be pretty light what we're going to see this year when it comes to ai and apple maybe some branding around the next iphone that's an ai phone some features in the next ios and mac os that will do some things that uh i think windows did a year or so ago and down the road this personalized agent agentic ai call it what you like i think is on the the road map so i'm keeping a close eye on the clock here doug we don't want to short change what started out the week with a bang which was elon going or elon going to china us getting like preliminary approval for fsd in china shares of tesla were up 18% on that news what was your reaction surprising i think uh that china would give particularly given how the relations have been between china and the us that china would give uh right after tik tok too like right i mean the timing was crazy who could have predicted that um but give an american company um this this clearance i mean obviously by has been operating uh apollo its autonomous service in wuhan for uh a long period of time now they have a lot of data including a lot of data with uh driver uh less complete so no safety driver in the car um so yeah i thought it was was pretty surprising and as we think about this opportunity around robo taxis the thing that we've been talking a lot about is i mean ultimately the government is probably a bigger roadblock than the technology itself in the next three five years um and so to get a government approval even it's not in the us we're talking about overseas that's it's a big deal and it's china's a big market too about a third of ev sales are in china so i would have lost a dollar if i put a bet on how that played out and i think it does speak to maybe we're getting closer to fsd we're going to talk a lot more before august 8th in terms of our expectations on what to expect from that event but definitely a nice i call this a leap forward for fsd they're not approved yet but still a leap forward on behalf of doug and jean and this episode of deep tech 315 bye for now
Gene Munster's Key Takeaways from iPhone 15 Launch Day,2023-09-22 20:41:09+00:00,7,GN2jhj1QAsg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN2jhj1QAsg,welcome to pressure points our topic is google earnings and i'll start just from the highest level uh how the stock is doing at the time of this recording were about an hour after google's conference call ended and the stock is up about 12% it did peak during the conference call up 14% but in general since the numbers have come out it's been up about the same about 12% so big picture is that investors are viewing these results as positive as they should and i'll jump into the pressure point which is search but also want to talk about what's going on in cloud capex and margins so starting with the pressure point which is search this of course is the pressure point because investors have a concern that as more use of generative ai starts to replace search that's a negative for google and if you use these tools you'll know exactly what i'm talking about because in my case as i use them i use gemini and gpt a lot more every day i'm using it more where i'm using google search less and so that sets up for this concern uh there is the concern in the near-term and the longterm in the near-term the march results show that they're doing just great search was up 14% year-over-year that was ahead of expectations for looking for 11% growth and a slight acceleration from the december quarter which is up 133% so this is just under 60% of google's revenue this is important so for the march quarter it looked great and then ceo suer pai talked about the impact uh that they're seing or gave some more kind of uh nuance detail uh one piece around this he talked about the cost of doing uh these uh uh adding uh some ai generative ai to search and he said they're doing it in a coste effective way that was one another piece to investor concern so he addressed that but more importantly is just how is the overall search experience going to evolve and start to uh feather in generative ai and how they're going to monetize from it and so he emphasized the the search generative experience this sge that's like this effectively it's like a essentially a beta where they're starting to layer in overlay some generative results with search results and he said that the and that what their early results they're seeing is that it has been uh working well in terms of as more people do generative uh interactions at the same time that is increasing their search interaction so just saying that more engagement is better more shots on goal more time spent with google you're going to end up searching for more that all makes sense eventually they got to figure out the monetization uh mechanism around that so uh he did and i think this is why it represents as the pressure point the last comment that he had on the call wasn't related to a question but i'm going to read you his quote because it really uh emphasizes the importance of what's going on in search he said that uh there are questions about monetization and based on our testing so far i'm comfortable and confident that we'll be able to manage the monetization transition well and so what he's saying is based on their testing they believe that they can uh make this transition and the testing he said it has to do with uh satisfaction and what they're seeing with related to monetization as they bring these two together in sge and so my overall take is as a google investor in deep water and our flagship titan fund i feel good about that and i also recognize that we're not out of the woods yet but at least the early indications are positive so that's a pressure point let's jump next to cloud growth that uh was uh impressive up 29% year-over-year this the street was looking for 20 5% and last quarter was 26% so we saw a nice acceleration within that my take is this is a great example of why the ai paradigm shift is going on when you're seeing the strength in google cloud revenue and of course microsoft reported a slight acceleration in their azure revenue to 31% in the march quarter that's just a sign that this is actually happening next related to capex of course with what happened the meta everyone was on high alert in this case capex came in 21% higher than invest than analysts had expected yes uh capex went through the roof to12 billion that was up 91% year-over-year but investors didn't care about it in part because last quarter google made it very clear that they're going to they mentioned three times on their december call that capex is going to be going up so i think that they did a good job of of kind of uh uh letting investors know that this was coming and then i think what happened with meta yesterday people got it out of their system a little bit some of those concerns about what's going on in capex but up as i said 91% year-over-year they're spending a boatload my general sense and the the guidance uh related to capex is to expect it to be in line to increase slightly from these current levels my sense means is that that gets us to 12 to maybe $4 billion a quarter in capex which ironically is kind of a similar amount that microsoft is spending on a quarterly basis so my overall take on capa is it's going up it should be going up that's what you do when you want to own a paradigm shift is make the investments i'm glad to see investors are okay with that uh the last is just related to overall margins and uh cfo ruth parat gave commentary to expect despite all the investments that they're making not just in cap acts but and hiring around u these expensive people ai people to to build these uh despite all that they expect margin expansion and so when i heard that i thought the stock would start to rally even higher it didn't do that it just kind of stuck around but to me that is really a great sign that they're doing this balance between going for growth but also keeping a close eye on the bottom line expanding margins pretty impressive so uh that's uh this episode of pressure points i'm jean monster bye for now
004: The State of GPU Demand with Hydra Host CEO Aaron Ginn,2023-09-26 21:49:45+00:00,28,m1IWiOAcGoA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1IWiOAcGoA,[music] welcome to pressure points our topic is micron earnings for those of you who are new to the micron story the company's about 160 billion market cap stock has been strong this year up 72% based on the ai hardware trade and so the setup was a relatively high bar going into the quarter and shares are trading off 7% i believe that the reason why they're trading down is that those momentum investors just didn't see that incremental reason to be more positive about the story i think long-term investors are going to view the quarter the guidance and the commentary on the call as favorable for this ai trade and my conclusion related to the quarter is that the ai trade is intact but i'm going to kind of step back and quickly go over the results the the may quarter was a slight upside on revenue and earnings the august quarter was the guidance was basically in line with expectations and in an ai hardware world if you guide in line that's considered a slight disappointment that's what we're seeing in the the shares trading the aftermarket but we're going to uh jump into the pressure point which is high bandwidth memory and this of course is what was the pressure point and it's what everybody was talking about on the quarter it's only surprisingly 2% of total revenue today it was nothing a few quarters ago it's expected based on kind of filling in some gaps with their commentary my sense is it's going to be kind of 10 to 15 15% of revenue next year so going from 2 to 10 to 15 it is a higher margin revenue but it also has this effect of pulling up the margins of their other dram business and the reason is that these hb these hbm memory which pair really well with like nvidia's gpus for this incredible compute the reason is that these take up more wafers the current generation they're on is a three wafer uh the next generation that comes out next year is four wafers and what that effectively does is it psts some dam supply over these dam wafers to build these hbms and so the effect there is it actually contracts some of the dram supply and there's two other suppliers out there along with micron that's sk hex and samsung but it detracts that supply and therefore has an effect of uh creating uh less supply therefore margins kind of go up for both of their businesses so hbm has this nice effect of of bringing up uh the margins across the board they also gave commentary about uh kind of how they see the growth rate playing out and it's favorable they talk about the longterm which i i i put that in the three to four year range to be 50% growth now they just reported 82% growth and 50 uh and 90% growth for the august quarter uh but that commentary about hpm growing kind of 50% plus for the long term should be comforting for investors who are thinking one two two three years down the road that this demand can continue and so that was the pressure point hbm is intact therefore i conclude that the the broader story the broader ai trade is intact there is another topic not the the headline topic but a topic related to capex they did talk about capex for next year being about billion the street was looking for just over 10 billion before and that compares to 8 billion that they'll do this year so we're seeing this big jump and capex more than what some investors were expecting uh they uh they will get some of that back at some point years down the road through the chip act so you get an opportunity to subsidize but the reason why they're making that investment most of those that production is going to go to hbm but the reason is that they're just seeing this incredible demand dynamic it's just not slowing they won't actually get capacity from that investment to the earliest 2027 some 28 and beyond but they're really laying the groundwork for this to be more than just a two or three quarter story they really want to kind of ride this wave here this infrastructure wave that appears to be intact so my take away from the capex it was more but that's okay because it's partially subsidized and i think it is just a strong sign that they believe that the growth curve is going to be favorable uh for a while and so that's the uh that that's everything in a nutshell one kind of final piece is you navigate and think about this is an investment uh this business can be boom and bust we have a effect here of seeing some of the positive aspects of it you generally want to invest during the good times and while the stock will be down i generally see this is the good times in the next year two years for micron longer term there's going to be some point where they hit over capacity and that ends up negatively impacting asps and margins so we're not there yet ai trade intact and on behalf of pressure points bye for now
Pressure Points: Meta Connect,2023-09-28 02:11:42+00:00,8,j7yhapOavWE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7yhapOavWE,welcome to deep tech 315 our first topic this week is the nasdaq has been slipping down 5% since its high on july 10th that was triggered by comments from uh former president trump in his view that taiwan should pay for part of their defense and separately president biden and some increased trade restrictions related to companies like asml and basically restricting china from some of these but you have a market that's kind of nervous because it keeps going up and then you have this and it just kind of basically popped the bubble in the near term down 5% and uh as that was kind of unfolding there was this sense that the ai trade is unwinding i think i think that the market is uh hyper skittish in the sense that everybody feels like we're in this ai bubble we don't think we're in a bubble yet we think it's a bull market that will go to a bubble um but i think that what we're seeing this past week is people just looking for a reason to sell in large part these news items probably shouldn't be that much of a surprise i mean we've had stricter restrictions on uh semiconductors related to china for a while we're going to continue to see that ramp i doubt that this is the last time we're going to hear about more restrictions on that technology going to china and i also think now that the market is is repricing the reality of potentially trump winning the election in november starting to think about okay what might that mean for big tech because obviously they're the ones that have been affected the most i think they've been the largest piece of this market pullback here makes sense and you know that kind of nervousness in the market reminded me when i got into the tracking check stocks back in the mid 90s kind of the run from 94 to to 99 and i think it's worth noting that during that whole period before the.com bubble burst there were a lot of times that the market pulled back and in fact we recently checked there was 11 times that the nasdaq pulled back by more than 10% and so basically almost once every two years the average pullback was 14% the max was like 24% so right now we're down 5% i think this is the first time since the ai train got rolling back in january we'll call it january of 23 since we've had any sort of kind of measurable pullback but either way it's like this is kind of this is what happens right when you have bull markets is that people get nervous and then they they retreat and then they come back and i think pain is always magnified in markets you you know you go down a little bit and you experience some volatility particularly after a period where we've been sort of spoiled and we've had relatively little volatility you know since maybe the banking issue last february um you get spoiled then you you're down 5% and it feels like you're down 15 and i think to your point we should expect for as long as this ai bull market lasts we should expect other pullbacks we should expect other periods of doubt where we think that it's over and i think there's still a lot more to go one of the data point i would mention too we talk about large cap tech if you look at the forward pe multiples you know there's a lot of opinions about how expensive tech is are they are they not expensive just to put it into some perspective the group of the mag 6 trades at about 30 times forward pe if you look at the range for the past 10 years that group is traded between 37 times and 20 times basically so yes pees are a little bit elevated relative to their 10year averages but we're not at the peaks that we've seen we're not at sort of 2021 levels maybe we get there maybe we don't but i think it's helpful to remember you know that these companies they are some of the greatest companies in the world they have a multiple that i think reflects that largely it doesn't mean they can't keep working and i think it certainly doesn't mean that they're going to stop investing in ai anytime soon yeah my i come back that's uh a great point is that we're still early and i come back to the the fundamentals of ai or the potential behind it the near-term fundamentals in the midst of this we'll call it mini storm we have uh tsm reports uh they're even more in the midst given some of the trump's comments but they revenue growth for the june quarter was up 40% 40 that compares to i think it was 17% in the march quarter and flat in december so i mean it's happening they said that they're going to be basically won't be able to keep up with demand they won't catch up to demand until calendar 26 so it feels like the fundamentals here continue to move forward that's that's where our money's on uh let's uh jump to uh topic number two which is related to netflix earnings uh so uh call it the from a u the net sub ads the advertising number initially when the uh the numbers came out they had some a little bit of punky guidance related to how to expect kind of contribution from this ad model and shares initially traded off call it 7% as of this recording on friday the stocks down just about 1% kind of more or less in line with the nasdaq so kind of a non-reaction to the the quarter the stock did kind of come back during their earnings call if you want to call it that and when they talked about their optimism regarding the the advertising model longer term but the the piece that stood out to me was it took 28 minutes for a question to come up related to generative ai and how it's impacting their business and i think it just spoke to something that we all know is like netflix is not an ai company that's we're excited about what's going on with ai and u but the context of uh the answer management's response to how to think about generative ai was that they're going to make more content uh better content but not necessarily cheaper content they also talked about the piece about better recommendations things like that but i want to focus on that piece the content piece and uh so better content with ai do you agree with that and number two is uh at the same cost or should we see some sort of a cost advantage related to using generative ai and and building content we should get better content if ai is incorporated and i think in the near term what we'll see like we're seeing in so many industries it will be a mix of ai with humans and so i think you could see ai being offloaded for certain tasks maybe put ai in a writer's room right and it's it's this sort of synthetic third writer or fourth writer however many there might be on the team that's throwing in some ideas that's bouncing off some creative uh intuition that maybe another writer might not have and so i certainly think ai should enhance the content production the story lines are to get better it it should yeah i mean i don't think it'll make them any worse because obviously and we're seeing this again in most ai applications if the ai is not useful well then the humans will just ignore it so there's no downside to incorporating ai into many of these processes um in terms of it being more you know more or less expensive you'd have to think over the long run that it should be less expensive expensive and that's the point for all ai if if ai can't somehow reduce costs then it has failed at its task now that doesn't mean in the next three five years when we have this kind of team between humans and ai that it it might not red reduce costs yet in the immediate term but you have to think over the long run that it will otherwise it would have failed totally agree i just was thinking back as you're talking about that third writer in the room and the creative side of this and and since we started deep water in 2017 we talked about three things that only humans can do and that being empathetic community building um have being empathetic it really you need to hear it from someone from as another heartbeat as far as community yes you can build community through a social network but real community has to be human to human and we talked about creativity as as something that's unique and we'd refer to like you've never had like a hit song or a number one song be just completely generated by a machine it has some sort of like a spark of an insight from human and i'm curious is that creativity piece just given what we've seen in ai over the last year and a half is that something that the machine is going to be able to essentially are we gonna be talking two years now the two this two things that humans can do that machines can't do we might be and i would say you know that thesis around creativity community and empathy that we came up with in 2018 you not six years old and the one of those three that i've changed my mind the most on has been creativity because you can see it the more you use these tools there is sometimes a kernel of creativity there a lot of times i think that comes from the human and how we prompt them how we use these tools but that that spark that i see sometimes does give me some belief that the machines might be able to have some of their own creativity develop over time and um it may be that they come up with things that humans never thought of before i don't think the current models are really capable of that yet but over time i think we could see that and i've talked about hallucinations before you know here and why they're actually a good thing not a bad thing a hallucination is a form of creativity so i think that for all the things that we say negatively about hallucinations you can't get rid of all of that uh creativity that ends up in hallucination from these models because you do want them to be creative in the long run but in a useful way makes sense totally makes sense um my my vote is that i think that it's uh you're still going to need some sort of spark we're not going to have a hit song a number one song be entirely built by a machine at least for the next three to five years i'm going to reserve the right to change my mind of course as things progress last topic you couldn't escape from this especially if you were traveling uh was related to crowd strike and kind of the update that they gave and it basically sent like the globe in a tail spin here uh shares of crowd strike uh down 11% % on that initially was down almost like 14% rallied back a little bit stock still up almost 100% 97% year-over-year and so even with this pullback it's done magnificently well but as we're kind of processing this is kind of one of those uh things where you see it my eyes kind of jump to the next headline and and think they'll they'll kind of sort this out in due time but this really had a pretty big impact globally and and it's got to be having some brand damage to to crowd strike i think it is damaging i mean anytime there's a security issue where an outage happens right for one of these types of companies i think it does hurt the brand a little bit i think that over the long long run i would suspect that crowd strike will probably be fine i i still think it's a highquality company it's actually a company that we've owned before at deep water uh it's a company that's in our deep water frontier tech index right now um and so we still think it's a really great in that cyber security space right in our index um but i think the the bigger picture is this if you just think about you know what's this means to kind of global security i'll give you a glass half full uh take which is after you have an incident usually that's the safest time in the world right you think about this analogy that i always remember because it's hard to forget after 911 the safest time ever to fly probably in the history of flying was right after those terrible attacks happened because everybody has heightened awareness right and i think when you have something like this happen thankfully this wasn't an actual attack you know this was just an error uh in some of the the code that they pushed and updated but now you have to believe that that company in particular and probably other security companies around the world are on heightened alert for anything that might seem suspicious so we might enjoy maybe a few months at least of uh even more secure uh cyber than we've had in the past i'll fill that half full glass up even a little fuller is that this is just going to remind businesses about the u about the importance of cyber security and ultimately is that uh you know this kind of the protection that's needed ultimately came from inside of of crowd strike but i think that there is there is a case that this can be turned into a positive my my sense is that when they report their june quarter there's probably going to be some hair around it related to this and uh i don't know if it comes in the form of a charge or comes in the form of their expectations that some of the renewal rates may come in at lower prices because if if you're a business and you just lost $25 million in revenue and you go to that uh go back to the negotiation table for your next two years you're probably going to say let's share some of the pain here and so we're probably not out of the woods it's probably not quite priced in in the near term but longer term crowd strike is in a great place agree um i'll give you a final word on uh final word on on this topic i think we've talked at the beginning about uh some of the things around the globe whether that be taiwanese security uh whether that that be uh some of the engagements that the us is in across the world and obviously we may have an administration change later this year i think all those things you add them up and you talk about the importance of cyber security i would just reiterate that we are going into world that has an ever increasing need for those kinds of services and so that's something just like ai i don't think is going away anytime soon well said on that we'll uh catch up next week on deep tech 315 on behalf of doug and i bye for now
Vision Pro Will Be a Hitâ€”Once the Apps Show Up,2023-10-05 13:47:08+00:00,7,WySQJJTkI1A,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WySQJJTkI1A,welcome to pressure points our topic is meta earnings the call just wrapped up and as of this recording shares are down about 177% uh when the numbers initially came out the stock was down call it 10 11 12% and then it faded throughout the call we'll recap why the stock is down and then we'll talk about the pressure point i will say get to the punchline here i think that this is an overreaction because what they're doing in terms of inves for the long term ultimately should yield an accelerating revenue business so let's take two steps back and talk about the march quarter and the june outlook march quarter was fine they beat top and bottom line the june quarter outlook the revenue guidance if you look at the midpoint came in 1.3% below the street now that doesn't sound like much and doesn't sound like it justifies the stock being down this much but when you put in the context that investors had been hoping that they would be bumping up the reven vue guidance for the june quarter uh makes a little bit more sense so i kind of see this as a 5 to 7% revenue guide down relative to some of the whisper expectations second is they talked about increased capex spend uh the midpoint being 12% higher this year versus their previous guidance and and lastly they talked about overall expenses increasing those up a couple percent higher than what uh the analysts had been expecting so those were the three initial reasons why the stock was down and when we got on the call the fourth reason emerged in zberg prepared remarks he didn't waste any time he kicked off the call by talking about how important it is that they have been growing their daily active users uh they grew up by about 7% 3.2 billion is people visits their property on a daily basis it's remarkable but then he quickly went into and said language to the effect i want to make it very clear to investors that we are in an investment phase related to building the infrastructure and energy costs for building ai for the longer term and that the revenue contribution from this investment phase is going to be down the road he didn't give parameters in terms of how long the investment phase would last or what the level of revenue acceleration would be uh when these products come out but that comment alone sent shares down an additional 5% so that gets us to down 17% as of the end of the call and interestingly is that they didn't nothing really moved uh the none of the the stock really had no movement beyond that opening comment that he had about this investment phase and so uh that is not the pressure point why the stock is down the pressure point is related to what is meta's ai opportunity because that was the clear overwhelming message here as they are all in on ai they had that message before but i felt like this earnings call it was to a different level and part of it was because zuckerberg's uh i think conviction related to how ai can impact across their businesses they've talked about some of that in the past some of these products are now out meta ai which is basically a chatbot and they're starting to see some traction don't have any metrics on that but they talked about building other ai businesses around this uh later on the call zucker talked about building an ai powerhouse of models and when i hear that i think of some of the products i also think about what potentially could happen with llama and uh that is today obviously a free product and ultimately they will sounds like that they want to continue to grow that and figure out how to make money on it down the road and when i think about that opportunity i see something similar to like aws they could have some a cloud-based business that powers llama or they could sell tokens around llama but it's pretty clear llama's going to have some form of a pay business in the next five years uh and then the last piece is just comments how he wrapped up the call i think he did uh a wonderful job of concluding the call talking about the concept of agentic ai or agent or personalized ai pick the term you want but this basic concept of going beyond generative ai where you prompt a model and you get a response or you're on customer support and you get a response going to ai that actually gets things done for you and he talked about his belief that this will be the most pervasive uh agent-based ai model down the road this in quotes being uh some future products that we don't know about today but that agent-based ai goes beyond just prompting to and responding to you give the agent a task to do whether it's he gave an example about researching a topic or buying something it's really endless what you could ask uh to do resolve your cable bill set up uh meetings with uh colleagues help me plan a trip it's infinite the number of ways that you can use agent-based ai but he sees that as an opportunity we're probably two years off before we see a product but ultimately this company is betting big on ai making some significant investments 12% increase in capex of course at least in 2024 that may lead into 2025 so that is the uh was the real core that is uh the pressure point it is uh noteworthy i should probably mention uh one small piece this is related to what's going on with china and some of the impact to meta's business uh many people have been wondering how much was the negative guidance related to china they wouldn't break it out on the call i think that part of the june guidance was in fact fact related to softness in uh and teu specifically and they talked about this these difficult comps that are coming from china china of course came up off of covid lockups later than most of the world that was a benefit and they're seeing difficult comp so whether it's related to the co lockup comps or related to geopolitical doesn't really matter it's a headwind to revenue in the near term again the pressure point meta is making big investments into ai whether it is uh core products or on core products and advertising products separately on products related to um what can be on agent based or llama on behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now
Pressure Points: Gene Munster on Expectations for Tesla Earnings - September Quarter 2023,2023-10-11 13:51:42+00:00,7,uJXL-EXqeaA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJXL-EXqeaA,welcome to deep tech 315 our first topic is tesla delivery numbers they came in down five% year-over-year the whisper number was more like down 7% they were down 9% in the march quarter so we saw a less bad number in the june quarter and shares rallied on that up at 1. i think 8% kind of closed around the plus six% range for the day after having a relatively strong week and so we have this kind of movement higher and the reasons for i think some of the improvement i think it's just a little bit of if you want to call it stable more stable demand for their products even though they're down i think another uh piece to it is uh more importantly is just kind of what does this mean going forward so doug as i've kind of processed this and saw the numbers and thought well let's uh put june now in the rearview mirror and think about what's going to happen going forward i just want to quickly look up not and tell you what the street expectations were though for the september quarter the streets looking for deliveries to be up 8% and december uh so was for september 8% again for december for calendar 25 up 18% in calendar 26 up 20% and so at the most basic level i was just kind of putting the pieces together investors are just seeing the path here and saying we're probably through the most difficult period and we're going to start start to see better delivery rates and i think that is the fundamental question i mean we we talk a lot about evs at deep water as i'm sure you can imagine we had sort of a debate on this earlier this week and the question was i think the theme coming into this year was that the ev market was maybe overhyped and we were kind of due for this negative period we've obviously had several quarters now from tesla's perspective but i think just the industry broadly where it feels like we hit a temporary saturation point i think that's a fair characterization and now to your point the question is we look forward tesla's starting to get into some easier comps and then obviously the comps get easier as you get into some of those uh march and uh june numbers you talk about for next year can they hit those you know kind of back to solid double digit year-over-year growth numbers i think if they do i think that'd be good for the industry it obviously be good for tesla but i think that is a a fundamental question of where is that growth coming from is there still lat demand in the us i mean there was a report we were talking about uh earlier this week or i think it was maybe last week that it came out that said a pretty decent percentage i don't remember that off the top of my head of ev owners are actually considering going back to icees and it kind of begs that question of that if that starts to happen yeah if that starts to happen then some of these 10 15 20% growth numbers i think become harder to hit so you're take is you're taking the under on the 18 % for calendar 25 and 20% for 26 right now reading the tea leaves in the market i would take the under on it i don't think it's drastically under like i think it's in the right ballpark but the idea of getting back to you know if you're a tesla bull i think you have to hope you go eight8 15 20 25 right get back into the mid 20s and stay in the mid 20s to really get excited i think that's harder to get to because i do think we're at this digestion period and it might be kind of that crossing the chasm thing that we see so much in tech where we had really strong early interest from early adopters and you get kind of those early followers who want the new thing and now you're getting to a point where it has to shift into a mainstream product and to that data point about uh ev owners even thinking about going back to icees maybe evs just aren't a big enough jump in terms of improvement for the average ic owner to get excited and get us you know to that 20 30 40 50% ultimately dominant market share for evs love it my take is they will come under on that 18% for calendar 25 i think they're going to get people excited on august 8th about some new variants coming and it'll probably take longer than expected to get those out so that probably has that uh what's it called the lindy effect when they're uh people kind of hold off people are gonna wait so i think there's there's some risk to that and then i think that that just gets pushed into 26 but either way i think that the growth rates of deliveries are going to be improving maybe the 18% is 15% or 133% but i still think it's going to be up from calendar 24 and the other piece is uh i'm in a slightly different place i think that to get this to work it's you need deliveries to be probably 15% a year and you need fsd and if if they unlock that on elon has talked i think it was this week about just some pretty remarkable or a step improvement in fsd once again if they unlock that i think that the bull case for tesla is intact i'll give you a final word on this one i think what investors should think about here and this is always an interesting dynamic to think about is what has consensus shifted to in the market i think a year or two ago consensus in the market felt like evs are coming and they're coming really fast they're going to take over i sooner than people think and now i think that idea has probably shifted in terms of how the market is discount what is the future ramp of evs i think now the market's starting to think okay maybe it's going to take longer than we all thought before and you have to ask the question in the new scenario what's true is the market now right to price in a longer ramp for evs or could it be a little better than expected or is it going to take even longer than the market thinks does the market need to keep pushing it out i think that's what you have to figure out if you're an ev bull or bear love it we'll jump to topic number two which is phil schiller joining open ai board as an observer so really don't get a vote but get to kind of sit in on the meetings and does this ultimately mean that apple has threaded the needle when it comes to playing catchup in ai and just for the the quick recap here they are of course going to be using later this year uh gpt uh as or their um gpt 4 as kind of the underlying powering model for the llm side and then they have said publicly that they're going to be opening that up to other models like gemini and grock and claw in the future and so we see this kind of improving or this kind of expanding use of other models but yet at the same time even though they've said they're going to work with other parties we have this relationship getting closer with apple and open ai and my takea away from it was apple's in a really strong position because despite apple saying we're going to go to other people with this down the road other models and opening ey is still giving them a board observer seat and it it feels to me like apple has threaded the needle here and that needle specifically is playing catchup after basically being five years behind catchup in the large language model game and ultimately be able to scale and get into the game at almost no capex it's crazy if you look at apple's capex kind of going up steady mid single digits versus the other big tech going up 15 20% so my takeaway is uh they did it and ultimately what i think this means means is that their margins are going to improve down the road the key i think insight around everything that apple has done with ai is that the market tends to conflate technology and product as the same thing and they're actually different technology enables great new products but technology doesn't necessarily have to be the product if that makes sense i think what apple is so great at is taking what's available to them innovating it on it on their own ways making it easy to use appliying it and uh making it mass market i think that's what they're doing they're using their playbook we should have expected this probably in hindsight with ai um i don't think that means full stop that it is good that they don't have you know this influence over the model that they're not building their own true large language model trying to break out intelligence time will remain uh and time will tell us whether that's good or not but it also i think it's not that too dissimilar to how they think about manufacturing in general i mean they don't manufacture their own products they're wholly reliant on supply chain in china and india to build products and in the same vein they are now going to be wholly reliant to deliver advanced ai features to their customers on companies like ai maybe they do something with with google like you said we'll see uh but i think the question is can they still make that great product can they meld ai into something that people are really exc excited about and that's what i want to see in september with the launch of the new phone how does work fact that they're making it available and that interacts with the device that uh that one point terms of active iphones users call it 1.5 billion of those i mean that's all it doesn't have to be some spectacular use case of an llm it just has to be easy for people to use for apple to win i think that that can be true and then it begs a different question as it to apple's business model is it just incremental or is it transformational because that's the other thing we want to know right if it just makes your iphone 50% better you know that's probably not enough to really matter for the stock in any meaningful way to inflect right like that keeps them on their current trajectory probably but if it makes your phone five times better that that that's meaningful and time will tell on that as you said when we see the product but just some sensitivity around that is ultimately what apple can do here is offer a premium or allow an opportunity for open ai to offer premium version of gpt next year two years from now and give the free uh the lower end version the one-year-old version away for free charge $20 a month if you're curious in the math of 10% of the active iphone users opt into that where they're paying apple 20 bucks or paying open a 20 bucks a month apple gets their 15% uh cut of that consider it kind of an ongoing subscription that would yield just over five billion and basically peer income operating income that would increase their overall operating income by about 5% and so it's still to your point those numbers are moving in the right direction they're in the plus category but they're not uh kind of a breakout it's hard to do that when you're 400 plus billion in revenue so uh we'll jump to our final topic and this one's going to test my ability to pronounce names here but one of our portfolio companies which is rain ai they make an ai chip they hired announced a hiring this week jd alut tre and he was a senior director at apple and he worked for silicon on a chip think of him as probably a top uh five employee when it came to anything that's hardware or chip related at apple so this is a big win for a company that most people have never heard of and uh uh doug you just want to give us the quick rundown on what rain is all about and why a typical person uh should be uh aware of what they're doing rain is about creating artificial brains so if you think about what is compute doing what are gpus doing in the context of ai really that the computers the gpus they are the brains you know the software is how all your neurons would connect if you used the brain analogy and the gpu itself is the actual brain what rain is trying to do is make our current hardware paradigm much more efficient you know a thousand times more efficient than what we're seeing from the likes of nvidia and the reason that's really important if you've been following the ai space is there's this huge question right now about how do we create enough energy even if we can create enough chips even if we can get more data and and push more data through these models and training how do we have enough energy to actually pull it off and then also deliver on the inference to enable these a experiences and so companies like rain i think are critical to actually helping us live the ai future we all imagine because if we don't figure out the power thing one way or the other the experience won't be there it's super exciting it's one of those kind of uh one in a thousand uh shots that if it hits it could be uh just a game changer for the industry and so is that the right odds one in a thousand i think that's the right odds for for most startups yes i think that's correct and then most of them probably don't have the same level of upside that we're thinking about with rain um if it really works it's it's a profound outcome but the other thing i would mention too is you think about not just training but inference in terms of why is rain important um we're going to see a lot more ai happening on device apple included right with their with their neural processors i think that that is really where you start to see this low power paradigm happen first because so many of our devices they're on our wrist they're in our pocket they're in our ears to the extent that we can do inference live right there number one there's security advantages to that because you don't have to send data to the cloud people are sometimes sensitive about the data element and there's also a latency advantage so again if you don't have to send that data to the cloud and wait for an answer to come down ota you can do it right on on device you can have experiences that feel much like c3po in the movies right like you can actually have a a conversation with a robot real time so that that is what i think is critical that's power happens first is locally these battery powered devices we get robotics and then that comes to the data center and it addresses that bigger broader power issue we talked about love it this is going to be the hardware piece uh story that's going to continue as we'll are be back next week for deep tech 315 on behalf of doug and jean bye for now
DeepTech 315: Episode 1 - Global Conflict/China EVs/AI Chip Race,2023-10-13 18:56:33+00:00,14,C1pMor2Obws,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1pMor2Obws,[music] welcome to pressure points our topic is tesla earnings and as of this recording shares are down 8% in after hours trading had dipped to down as low as 8 and a half% and i'll jump right into the pressure point which is when will tesla start to see benefits in terms of revenue and profitability related to autonomy fsd fleets optimus prime potentially and i want to start the pressure point with a response that elon had to the last question on the call the question was related to how does a trump administration impact the availability of tax credits and if those tax credits go away what does that mean for your vehicle sales and for your storage and energy business and elon took the question in his response in a totally different direction which is related to the pressure point and he said i quote i re recommend anyone who doesn't believe that tesla will solve vehicle autonomy should not hold their stock they should sell their tesla stock if you believe that tesla will solve autonomy you should buy tesla stock and all other questions are just noise end quote and he has said variations of this in the past if you don't believe in autonomy you should sell the stock but of course he ends the call by reiterating that and what he's effectively saying is that everything that's going on in the business today doesn't really matter and one of those things that's going on the business today is profitability gross margins x credits were 14.6% and the fax set estimate was 16.9% in the march quarter it was 16.4% and so in a typical quarter this would have been the pressure point you know what's happening with automotive gross margins but because the pressure point has now shifted down the road to what's going to happen in 25 and 26 and 27 that takes some of the focus away from near-term profitability i would add though that even though that the near-term profitability is less of a focus they did generate cash now have 31 billion in cash so that's moving in the right direction but even though it's not the primary focus and a pressure point like we have in the past it's still important and i believe that that dip in profitability in part elevated some of the scrutiny that investors are having in terms of the timing of getting to the what's next around autonomy and fsd and so i want to dig in a little bit more into what was said around timing of those products and in their press uh release in the outlook section they said to they continue to believe they expect these uh new version some new version of vehicles uh starting production in mid 2025 now they said they continue to believe that elon on the last call did say sometime in mid 2025 but could be earlier i believe he may have even said like late 24 and so that is by some measure a little bit of a slip and then they reminded people that the new robo taxi will have a different unbox manufacturing process and it will come after the whatever vehicle is going to come in mid 225 and my sense is that's a bigger lift in terms of building production and so i think that the robo taxis probably start to ramp late 26 or 27 now if you'd have asked me before this i would have said robotaxi starts to ramp probably early in 2026 i might have said late 25 but early 206 kind of a time frame and so we got a couple of slips on that pressure point around getting to the what's next to the tesla story so that is the pressure point that's why the stock is down and i want to uh take a step back too related to the pressure point and getting to autonomy and think about what progress they have made to date and in the quarter there was some impressive improvement in the uh full self-driving miles driven and specifically is that they don't break out the number but they give this chart you can kind of back into the number but effectively the total autonomous miles driven increased from about 150 million in the march quarter to an increase by about 650 million in the june quarter so huge uh ramp up it is worth noting that when they they reported their last quarter in the when they reported their march quarter that was april 23rd so they basically had three weeks is of version 12 of fsd and they said they had at that point 300 million miles driven and so if you look at the 650 million miles added over the entire june quarter and said they did 300 million in the first month you can kind of back into that some of the uh usage of that did de inine in the uh the months of um it be of of may and june now elon did say on the call that when people use it they continue to use it but there's something that does doesn't quite fit right together with uh those 650 million miles i predicted based on how it did in april of this year i predicted that the number was going to be closer to like 850 or 900 million miles not the 650 so a big jump up give them credit for that that's a sign that things are moving in the right direction but there still is some a little bit of wonkiness in terms of how some of these autonomous miles are driven so that's the pressure point other things kind of around the edges related to u uh potentially licensing fsd alex potter from piper had a a question that i appreciated which was are we going to see any announcements around this or how far would an announcement be ahead of any sort of vehicle and they basically said it's years away for them to license fsc to third parties i believe that eventually that will be the case is that tesla will be doing that and also in terms of kind of other pieces the optimus piece they said that they expect it kind of consistent i think by the end of this year some robots in use by the end of next year i think it was a couple thousand and then in 20126 they said they expect to start to sell those no investors putting any weight into optimus i think it's still worth uh a part of a conversation point but the big picture here is that uh tesla the waiting game continues uh and some of the profitability is being negative impacted near term so that's the pressure point i do want to add my perspective to this is i still own a tesla shares personally i believe that the company ultimately can be worth more because i think the problems that they're solving are very hard and i think traditional auto is moving in a very different direction embracing the old embracing gas vehicles hybrids when i think you got to eventually make the jump entirely to electrification so i believe that everything that tesla is doing whether it's around electrification or autonomy ultimately will serve them well and i think that when you look at the the potential around that opportunity i think shares are still undervalued so on behalf of pressure points bye for now
Pressure Points: Gene Munster on Tesla Earnings - Q3 2023,2023-10-19 07:49:29+00:00,9,EWl4adoICGI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWl4adoICGI,"welcome to deep tech 315 our first topic is apple finding some common ground with the eu uh getting good in terms of the eu regulations specifically related to ios and the ability to use third-party payment stores within apple's ecosystem so right now if you have your iphone and you go to point of sale you double click the only thing that can come up is apple pay or if you have a payment mechanism within the apple ecosystem it is apple pay but they're going to allow third party wallets to plug into that caught my attention because it's rare that apple is reactive when it comes to regulation typically they're proactive you typically step in front of things think about what happened related to the changes in some of the app store take rates a few years ago that was being proactive around that they uh also were proactive at making some changes related to usbc uh going from lightning and also to a small extent the the repairability of phones that's on the react the proactive side reactive just mentioned what happened with europe they were also reactive in china related to certain apps that get banned and so they kind of respond to chinese leadership on that front but overall it's pretty rare that apple is reactive and that piece of it caught my attention we'll jump into the impact of apple but i just wanted to get your initial take when you saw the headlines my first take was this is something that kind of stems into you know a long battle or long let's say uh discussion i'm sure they've been having with the eu about all things related to the app store there's a lot going on there there's also probably a lot going on behind the scenes and and to your point about uh being proactive i wonder if they sort of knew or sensed something was coming and they were trying to get ahead of it i think that this all kind of plays into that idea of slowly but surely i think the app store and apple's ecosystem will get a little bit more open it has been getting a little bit more open over the last year particularly in the eu i think this is just the latest sign of that i bet there's probably still more to come so on that being more open of course that they have agreed to allow some form of steering in europe and they came up with some changes and then the eu or this year said not enough we got to make further changes and so that's still kind of in a process of of working itself out and so this kind of presented itself when we think about that collectively kind of the opening up of this my bottom line question is like what does it mean for apple's business ultimately and my sense at least with this payment mechanism yes they're going to allow third party payments but i bet 90% plus of people won't even go through the hassle of setting up a third-party wallet because keep in mind even if it comes in the in another inside another app you still have to set up that wallet this isn't as easy as making a change in your settings which a lot of people won't do that and so i feel like this is a lot of noise for nothing i don't think behavior is really going to change at least specific to this this piece of it there's the symbolism of it and then there's the actual effect of it and i think that they are two different things and to your point i think you're 100% right the actual effect to apple's business in all of this opening up of its ecosystem i think is going to be pretty negligible on the margin but i do think symbolically it matters because there are people within the apple ecosystem or at least uh you know uh around the apple ecosystem some of them are developers who are saying like the there should be a freer and more open reality to apple's ecosystem and i think we're starting to see a little bit of that you're never going to make everybody happy but i do think that the symbolism component of it maybe matters in some ways a little more than the actual effect in the business because it probably won't affect consumer behavior that much people are lazy i'm lazy i don't want to go set up a bunch of different wallets i'll probably keep using the product but at least knowing i have that option is a free thing and i think it's fair in the marketplace makes sense uh we'll jump to our second topic which was another surprise headline that tesla is going to be delaying their robot tax event from august 8th to sometime in october i don't know if it's official this is like bloomberg reporting but i want to take three steps back and give a little bit of the the background related to this august 8th event it came out of a fire drill that was going on when reuters put out a story saying that apple is abandoning the the lower the $25,000 i think it was a $25,000 uh vehicle that they were swing those pens or they're swing the robotex i forget which one it was but u immediately after i think the model two musk tweets out within like hours that we're doing an event on august 8th and it felt like pretty reactionary we should have seen i should have seen this one coming that it was going to get delayed but it it's worth noting that when apple elon's done this before he's felt behind on autonomy or uh some hardware and has uh i think he had robo taxy day back in the day a different ro uh was the ai event but he has kind of scrambled these events together kept the events on schedule but then of course when the actual products come to get delivered they're always late and so here we are u from we're we're shifting from august september um and i thought is like does this really change anything the bar is still really high for what he's talking about doing and whether it's comes out in august or october people are still going to wonder when the products are actually going to be available in 25 or 26 if ever i think first of all we can't be sure that anything has been delayed until elon blesses it and says it's been delayed you're pointed about the reuters report right i mean they say model was not happening and he said that this is a lie i think that was one of the firestorm kind of tweets that that followed that um i just checked twitter before we started recording elon has said nothing yet as of two o'clock yeah he could push this up and just say just to never know he he has tweeted since the report came out so the fact that he hasn't said anything very quickly says there's probably a delay if we're going to really play the game theory of it and maybe by the time uh this video comes out it's all but confirmed but i think the the point of the matter is what you just said uh what tesla does the products they build are really hard i try to be a tesla rationalist which is hard because there's so much religion on both sides of the is more than any other company more than any company and i think that if you really try to be objective about tesla they solve incredible real world hard physical problems better than probably any company and doing that often takes longer than they think and longer than investors hope and i think the the reality of this delay if it is a delay for the event is it probably shouldn't be a surprise my expectation was even if they had the event in august whatever timeline they put out in august probably would have been delayed anyway and so it's almost like we're jumping forward to the conclusion i'm sure the robo tax is gonna come out and it's g to be incredible it's gonna be awesome it'll be the best robo tax in the market i have very little doubt about that i also think it's going to take a lot longer than people think and it'll probably even take a a little longer to really impact the model because tesla's a really big business too that's that's fair and i think there's not much more that i can add beyond that i do believe that they're going to get there i think you just said that i think that they're going to crack this i think it is a path to higher profitability i think autonomy is going to improve humanity in part because it's safer in part because you pick up some more time so uh and should lower the cost of transportation as well but undoubtedly uh now we shift our calendar to october and our attention to the final topic which is an internal topic at deep water related to how these chat bots are progressing how are using them and most people first of all most people don't use them but people that do use them a lot of times use them to help craft a letter an email maybe generate an image uh uh summarize some text it's pretty straightforward but uh there's an opportunity to use these models to help predict the future and so we did a a quick sample of 15 questions so we asked the four primary models that of course being chat gpt gemini claude and grock 15 questions about events that are going to happen in 2024 ranging from sports to politics to geopolitical and uh to finance and uh i'm going to just highlight a few of the questions and then i want to get your take dog just on like what's going on behind the scenes here because i know that you've been intensely studying this dynamic around these gener of models but some of the questions we asked where who is going to be or is joe biden going to be the democratic candidate for president uh that uh do you want to guess i don't know if you saw the result you to guess what they said i did see the results so i i i won't uh okay gemini wouldn't respond anything political gemini just keeps its mouth shut and then we had gpt and claude saying maybe biden and then we had uh grock saying it would not be biden and then the question about who's going to be the next president kind of this one was a big surprise to me because we can look at the odds that the humans odds that are making but two of the four said that biden would be the president now if you look at the human odds here trump now is heavily favored by about a 3x margin right now that's the betting lines and so this is an example of the models going a very different direction than what the uh the humans have a couple other predictions that caught my attention one was that the that china would invade taiwan by the end of the year that was grock and gemini believe said that couldn't believe it when i saw it but it's just a prediction and separately those same two models predicted that essentially there'd be a correction in the magnificent seven by year end like a 35% correction in some of them and so those are some pretty uh bold statements i think or bold predictions from from the the the the models and i'm just curious like what's going on behind the scenes is this just natural about becoming more humanlike you're actually going to take shots like this on net if you're asked uh if you if you back all the way up and you just think about what are these models built to do they're built to answer questions prompts queries from users in ways that they think make sense based on their training data so at a base level based on their training data you said based on their training data right and system instructions and some some other things that we could get into but based on their training data let's say to make it simple um what i think is interesting when we think about let's say the political piece of it whether biden will be president uh the the n the nominee or not on the democratic side who will win presidential uh race i this is one of the things about grock that i think is interesting is obviously its training data is quite a bit different i think than gemini for claudes if you look at the responses gemini and claude if i remember claude sonet 3.5 i think their training data window goes up to like mid this uh q1 or something like that i think it's current i see what you're saying and i think gemini was or gemini didn't answer gbt i think was maybe late last year or something like that so first of all they may not even be aware that there's this question about what about the rra what's it called the wrap or the rav that where you can kind of rag get the rag yeah yeah you have to custom custom train that and that that gets into this whole idea of making these models a predictive force because i will tell you i think i think that so we ran a fairly basic experiment here what's really interesting is that you can run even more complex experiments you could layer on other things to i think make predictions even better and what you can do is you can take data from more current systems you can take proprietary data you can take whatever you want and feed it into the models to give it a little bit more of a sense of the current environment so for example if we wanted to retest this we could give the models data about current predictions current line in the election right or current betting lines for the democratic pres i don't want to give it that i want it to think outside of being a human i don't want it to go off data or yeah you that's the thing that i think is is difficult to balance in these prediction exercises and so i've been uh getting very in the weeds with using these models to make predictions stock predictions as we've talked about before but i've also been using them more recently to make very detailed earnings predictions for individual companies and what you can do is with without trying to bias the model because there's always a potential for that depending on the kinds of data and instructions you give it but if you balance the data right and you balance the instruction set right and you give it some prompts that use something like chain of thought reasoning is one pretty powerful tool where you kind of give it a list of instructions and this is basically how a human would process a question like this if you were an economist let's say and you wanted to predict whether the fed might cut interest rates you might look at at unemployment you might look at inflation you know you might look at things like that gdp growth um and you might make some certain assessments with of that as a human economist you can tell the model hey this is how a human would think about it the model will actually think of it like a human and process it and then give you an answer based on that chain of reasoning and so that's what i think is really cool with these models is they are these dynamic tools you can give them a simple request hey just make a prediction for me it'll answer the query because that's what it's trained to do it did yeah surprised at how quickly it answered it tooo exactly and you can take it to another level though and give it that data you can give it that chain of thought reasoning and i think you can get even better predictions and that's what i'm seeing so far in some of my testing on these earning predictions 10-c answer if you start feeding it more data on top of it are you biasing the model to a prediction that you might want depends on the data entirely and it depends on the prompt you have to be careful in the prompt because sometimes they will take it very literally if you say you know historically it's been they might just say okay well historically it's been x i'm gonna say x that's not really that useful that's the chief prompt officer here doug clinton on behalf of our chief prompt officer and jean and deep tech

DeepTech315: Episode 2 - Tesla & Netflix earnings/AI Bubble,2023-10-20 22:56:49+00:00,19,ibkuDwTsfzY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibkuDwTsfzY,welcome to deep tech 315 our first topic today is micron they reported their earnings they came in line with the may quarter and or slightly beat for the may quarter and they guided august quarter in line with expectations shares traded off 7% on the the news this of course is an important company because they make this memory and getting more into this high bandwidth memory that pairs up really nice with some in products and they are riding the wave of ai their business in the may quarter was up 82% that guidance was for 90% year-over-year growth for the august quarter and so when you put those kind of uh forces together it looks like uh things generally were in the right spot but it just wasn't enough to meet what the the hype was around the quarter how what do you explain that 7% decline it was actually better than i expected in terms of the decline coming into the quarter my sense was there was a lot that had been priced into the stock it's had a great run this year and it's had an even stronger run the last month or two and so i think there's probably a lot of fast money and i think there's a lot of fast money in general chasing some of these ai hardware names so to me it wasn't a surprise base cas should have been hey this thing might sell off a little bit here unless they just have some astronomical the bas case with ai i agree the bottom line is just looking trade or something like that and you're looking at the bigger picture for ai i think their commentary reinforced what what the standard belief is here at deep water which is we're still in the early innings of the ai build cycle and that's going to continue for several years makes a ton of sense and specifically there's a lot of questions regarding the the high bandwidth memory piece of the business it's it's only 2% of their revenue it didn't exist a few quarters ago they didn't give exact guidance of what to expect it to account for in fiscal 25 but you could kind of back into uh their market share expectations and get to kind of uh 10 to 15% of revenue so going from 2% to 10 to 15% of revenue and uh this piece around the high bandwidth i think there's just a a fun dynamic around it because it typically takes three and next year four of these dam wafers to make an hpm they are essentially pulling some of their inventory away from their kind of core product and what that will have the effect of is restricting supply in the marketplace because there's only two other samsung and sk highx that make these makes basically make dam and will have the effect of raising the margins of the overall business and so uh this is uh definitely a boom part of this the cycle here things are looking really good and i i agree with you wholeheartedly on the ai piece but as you kind of think maybe beyond looking into these uh increased capb backs that they had and they're going to be bringing more capacity on in 27 and 28 and 29 uh isn't this a function of time before micron blows up blows up is probably a strong word i would i would word it differently and say uh there is a cyclical reality to the chip space there has been for decades um where you get these inventory builds you get these inventory draws you have concurrent pricing dynamics that then just change the revenue and margin dynamics of these businesses and so right now obviously we're in an inventory draw down we're in a more supply constrained environment that is good for revenue and margins for micron and others in the space i think the question is how long are we going to live in this environment it could be one more year it could be 10 years and as an ai investor i think that's true for most of these hardware names you you're really making an assessment of how long do you think this build cycle will last and and really what that question boils down to is how long do you think we're going to have these linear scaling laws for machine intelligence so long as we keep getting better intelligence with more data and more compute we're going to have to keep building more of this hardware if something changes with the way these models are structured and the way we create artificial intelligence that could be you know kind of a step function change moment where the demand picture changes probably not overnight i think that would be exaggerated but in a short order where this could get rated and that that's that's what you really have to figure out here yeah that changing piece that you're referring to is effectively the models become more efficient and are able to get smarter on less you don't need to kind of continue to increase the compute capacity to improve the intelligence of the model there's some sort of a a shift like you said a paradigm shift around how the models are being built and and what what's the reality of of that happening are we seen any indications that know microsoft recently talked about them wanting to pursue this and is this something that is kind of brewing in the back halls of these of the tech giants to try to improve the efficiency of these models everyone is certainly experimenting with alternative ways to build these models i don't think we've seen anything or heard anything certainly not in published research yet that would lead us to believe that there is that change on the horizon but i think it's something that will be it'll be a perpetual exper experiment because either one one of two things going to happen we're either going to hit agi and then potentially super intelligence on the current path this linear scaling path and then if there is a better way to do it then theoretically the agi or the super intelligence should be able to figure that out and do it for us or we're going to figure out this other method and we're going to change there right so like if it exists we will find it and bump into it at some point just naturally is there like a what would be the analogy of something that's happened in the past that would suggest that they will find more efficient models or won't i you probably if you give it the broadest interpretation you would generally probably say something to the effect of everything in technology over time gets better and more efficient um you know gas cars today are more efficient than gas cars 100 years ago evs today you know are going to be less efficient than evs 10 years from now um so historically in technology those things do get more efficient but i ar capacity the demand increases too over time but it doesn't well yes and it doesn't necessarily mean that the model itself has to get better right it could be that the underlying hardware that supports the models gets better they could become more power efficient i mean that's the other bet the inverted bet here either you're betting that the models get more efficient and we need less of our current type of hardware to support intelligence in the future or you could bet the models don't get more efficient but the chips do right you get you get a chip that can process the uh type of intelligence using transformers you know that we're doing right now uh in a better way so that's that could be where you get the efficiency from i i'll tell you this like i guarantee you we will find efficiency in the current paradigm that we're pushing here whether it is that we go to a different model architecture or that it is through efficiency in the hardware makes a ton of sense let's jump to the second topic amazon is rumored to be coming out with a basically a teemu competitor and there uh have been kind of in the back of investors minds has been this kind of competitive risk amazon stocks done really well this year i think it's up like 30 plus percent but this uh teemu piece now it sounds like that they're going to address it and um i think it's it's kind of was inevitable that they're going to get into this it's not a surprise and um my question is do they need to brand this as something different or is are they do they need to kind of feather this in kind of like amazon fresh is just kind of part of sometimes when you do a search on amazon then some of the items are fresh some of them aren't you think it's going to be like that or it's just going to be kind of a separate experience um i think they should probably feather in more than create a separate experience i i don't think that um separating doing this lowcost piece from the amazon brand would make a ton of sense because i mean there's already a lot of low price junk from china on amazon so it's not like they're introducing some new category of product you know it just feels like they're may be finding ways to make things even cheaper or introduce even lower cost items on amazon so to me feathering it in makes more sense and then you have it built right into a shopping experience that people already love but do you know like there's a quality difference there too like teemu is almost like disposable commerce and yeah i think there's a lot of things you can buy on amazon now that are disposable though for sure that's true but i think t level almost a level further in that yeah no i think it probably is but but i think um if it's disposable at this level and then it's disposable and it costs a dollar or two less i don't know that you're going to have some negative opinion of the amazon brand if you know that you're getting the lowest cost possible thing well it show up in the rating eventually that i think that's yeah things would probably score lower based on that and i i wonder just what does this mean for margins if this ends up at ultimately becoming a bigger part of their business is at lower margin they wouldn't be the the supply are they the first would they be the first person in this or are these like basically allow for a third party type of teu experience didn't seem clear maybe a mix uh but it sounded like they're working with suppliers that are in china that are going to deliver these and and whether that means they advertise right and and function as third parties or do it through amazon or fba you know it might be a mix and the margins like is is something that we should is now this going to become the question because teemu can't be making any money certainly not when you factor in all that they're spending on advertising so i think from from a a customer based standpoint that's one benefit that amazon probably has is they don't need to go out and build a brand of something that people have never heard of before right so i think that's the biggest structural issue for t-u margins knowing amazon the way they run their infrastructure the way they run their company you know they can probably get away with it being at least break even if not modestly profitable would be my guess over the long run awesome we're going to shift to the third topic which is we're wrapping the first half of the year at the time of this recording a lot of headlines related to just kind of the strength of ai and nasdaq being up 20% for year-to date and uh just what a great year this has been for tech and of course when you go below the hood it tells a little bit of a different story we looked at kind of the top five ai hardware companies year to date up uh 75% the top five software companies year-to dat down 3% i mean these are big companies and it is i mean that couldn't be more of the t of two topics uh up 75 down three and uh is software going to get the ai bid at some point yes but i think right now the sentiment is software is dead and that there's a a question of is this broad category of software are they going to be beneficiaries of ai or are they going to be victims of ai and i think that it depends company to company we haven't really figured that out in many cases because most of the these companies are the ones that are building some of this software internally they're building some of this infrastructure uh internally and they're just starting to get products into customers hands and it's unclear if they can make more money you know from these products that have been enhanced by ai so i think it's going to take time still for us to see that i don't think this is the year and we've been saying this all year i think as well this is not the year that you're going to see the inflection in software revenues from ai like we saw from nvidia in hardware i think that were're at least a year from that if not maybe two and i did hear a recap of something i think it was saa nadella was speaking at the c conference a week or two ago and he's he was kind of framing it as there's sort of this mismatch in duration between these companies including microsoft needing to invest a ton of money in infrastructure right now and the ultimate payback period i think there's this assumption or maybe hope from investors where it's like okay we're investing this year and then we're going to get payback immediately and i think what nadella was trying to say was we're investing this year but it's going to take us years potentially before we really get payback from this investment so you you have to believe that ai is this paradigm shift that many of us think it is and then you're going to see the benefits of it over time not that we all of a sudden get this inflection you know next year and everybody's inid yeah i wonder should we be positioning our portfolio more towards software right now we've had great hardware exposure but should we position that more towards software i mean ahead of the curve if you want to be a year early if things start really revenue starts going in 2027 probably now is the time to start to build positions and i think we've done that or we try to do that creatively at deep water where our benefit is we get to invest in the public and private markets and when we think about the beneficiaries of ai where it's really not priced in you know i think and and beyond just looking at the mega caps and and their brethren i think the playbook for us has been invest in hardware in the public markets largely that's where most of these big companies exist and those are the ones that are creating these products micron we talked about earlier and in the software side really looking at it from a private markets perspective xai is a recent investment that we made at deep water that we're really excited about obviously one of the four potential uh foundation models in our view but even beyond that i think there's other great companies out there in the private markets that have pure play ai exposure that you can't find in the public markets and that's what we're really trying to build the portfolio around i love it on the private side look for those companies to be going public two three years down the road uh it won't be that long before we're back that'll be next week on behalf of dp 315 bye for now
Pressure Points: Gene Munster on Microsoft & Alphabet Earnings,2023-10-25 01:51:34+00:00,6,u4m6u8DQAto,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4m6u8DQAto,[music] welcome to pressure points i'm jean our topic tonight is nvidia earnings it has the tech landscape riveted to the after hours trading the stock's currently up 9% in after hours as of this recording we're going to talk a little bit about the quarter in the stock in the near- term and then hit the pressure point which is what is the underlying growth rate of this company for 2025 and beyond as far as the quarter it was a relief they had slight upside they also guided the april quarter which is the current quarter we're in about 9% higher than where consensus was and that uh caused this relief rally in the stock i think that's the primary reason why the stock is up uh it effectively recaptures the the loss in the stock over the last three days so it's gone down about 9% now over the last three days and now it's up 9% so we're kind of where we were at of course there just before earnings there was some negative commentary from the sell side about uh expectations and then we had po alto networks had a slight guide down and the stock was down 25% plus on that today which kind of reminded investors if things aren't perfect then they can go down quickly and so in this case i think the quarter was perfect uh they continue to grow they gr at 265 per in the just reported january quarter and are expected to grow at 235% in the april quarter and that is off of a little bit more of a difficult comp this quarter it's about a 7% more difficult comp but when you kind of put it all together they had the appropriate upside to cause this relief rally but that is a good segue to what is more important which is the pressure point and that is what is nvidia's underlying growth i just talked about the current growth numbers and if you look at calendar 24 the streets looking for tomorrow they'll probably be at around 70% growth down from that mid 250 growth and then for calendar 25 the numbers will probably come out in the high teens call it 18% so we see this dramatic slowdown and that's why nvidia shares essentially trade just above its growth rate in the high 20s on the next 12 months earnings multiple reasonable because investors think that this is going to slow dramatically and so throughout the quarter or throughout the conference call that's where my mind was at is trying to get any sort of insight into in terms of jensen wong the ceo's outlook in terms of what this growth how the growth can continue and uh two pieces i want to highlight here is during the prepared remarks jensen didn't say anything that's typical the cfo do the talking uh he answered the first question and he talked about the opportunity in ai with what basically was muscle memory for him he just kicks into talking about these four waves of ai the first is related to the hyperscalers this is the infrastructure layer this is the ai startups this is the big tech companies and that is kind of pushing the current curve of adoption the next uh phase we're just still early within that called a quarter of the way through that uh the second phase is at the application side the enterprise side and this is companies like service now or uh salesforce uh adobe implementing those applications and we did see an uptick and inference 40% of compute was related to inference which suggests things are moving along there but that's the second wave the third wave is hasn't even started and that's generative ai within heavy industry don't quite know exactly how that works out but jensen's big on that and last is sovereign ai which is governments using artificial intelligence for their own knowledge base and also for culture and so uh he started out the q&a with just reminding investors how he believes that this has multiple levels and then we navigated through the q q&a not a ton of insight terms of that pressure point question what's the growth rate in 25 beyond and then uh he gave his final comment this kind of signoff comment and a lot of times i just uh ignore these comments i am reminded over the years that sometimes there's a a little bit of an easter egg that gets dropped in and we did get a small one in this case and specifically he talked about the opportunity on the infrastructure side and then on the compute side and his final comment his sign off comment was effectively we're at the early stage of ai it's going to impact every company every company will be an ai company and nvidia is going to provide the infrastructure for that and as far as the broader infrastructure he used a trillion dollars spend over the next five years and he said that that would be about doubling now that is more than just invidia piece of it uh the compute side with nvidia but he says triling in infrastructure essentially doubling and then he said within that on the compute side which is nvidia's piece it could be several hundred billion dollar business or market opportunity so how do we interpret that several hundred billion i'm just going to take understand that this is very hot level but just take a pass at this or a swing at this is that we'll take it as 300 billion in revenue is what he's saying in 5 years which would be calendar 28 300 billion in calendar 28 and if that's the case that this is a 300 billion dollar market in calendar 28 and nvidia has a 60% share of that compute market today their share is just above 80% but if they have 60% that means that in calendar 28 they'll do 180 billion in revenue uh expectations are for calendar 25 is about as far out as analyst go and that's for just around 110 billion and so if you kind of fill in the compound growth rate from that 25 number of0 billion to the 180 million in calendar 25 that's about a 16% keger that's about 16% growth per year that would be in years 25 26 27 and 28 and so he's basically building the case to say yes our growth is going to slow but it will be slow and then kind of stabilize at that call it 15% as the infrastructure essentially doubles over the years and so i think that's what's most important here we know their growth rates are going to slow dramatically the comps get really difficult in july but any sort of insight in terms of what this business can grow at 25 and beyond is helpful he gave us a little bit of it you can take it or leave it i tend to take it because i think that he knows what he's doing when he's talking about how the opportunity and he's seen it in the business so we put it together i think there is is a case that they are guiding for revenue growth in those out years that are higher than where most expectations are so that's a wrap on nvidia quarter lots there but that is the pressure point on behalf of pressure points bye for now
Pressure Points: Gene Munster on Meta Earnings,2023-10-26 02:04:12+00:00,7,4L3ZmE2yj8A,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L3ZmE2yj8A,welcome to this week's episode of frontier and center where we discuss frontier tech i'm jee mster from deepwater asset management as a reminder frontier tech are the technologies and themes that we're going to be changing our lives over the next five years and by definition frontier tech is dynamic it changes as different technologies start to become more important to our lives so for example ai is a bigger component of frontier tech than it was 5 years ago but this is the most cutting edge themes and that's what we wanted to discover look beyond the magnificent 7 in tech and as we begin each episode we talk about the l deep water frontier tech index that etf is year-to dat uh up 2% that compares to the nasdaq that's up 5% and since inception l is up 69% and each week we discuss one of the companies in the etf and this week we're going to highlight unity sof software that's ticker you as in uniform this is a$1 13 billion market cap stock it is basically flat over the past year and is down significantly from its peak in 2021 unity was caught up in a lot of the excitement in 2021 and peaked at a 72 billion market cap so this is down 80 plus% year-over-year and while i don't believe we're going to see that kind of market cap in the next three years i do believe that the shares are undervalued and we'll jump into why that is uh unity has two businesses one is called grow solutions which is an advertising business and second is the software solutions and we're going to start with growth solutions it's actually the least exciting part of their business it is 2third of their revenue and this advertising business basically allows game developers to put ads in their games and so when you see a page takeover ad when you're playing a game uh that would be an example of their software excuse me their growth solutions or if you're playing du lingual for example and watch an ad to level up on your points uh that would be an example of a unity based uh some of their growth solutions and so uh this business well it's a sizable part of their revenue it's really hit and miss in terms of uh its performance on a quarter to quarter basis when times are good this business really goes well and when times are bad or there's some changes to platforms like what apple did with idfa it can have a major impact on the stock and what we've seen over the past year in particular is that there's been some wild variations in the stock and i counted uh there's 17 times in 2023 that the stock was up or down more than 15% over a short period of time and the uh there's actually nine of those it was down and the other eight it was up and so it's this been this seesaw battle which isn't very reassuring but part of the reason for all this seesaw is related to investor anxiety around what is going to happen with their their grow business and so we're not going to spend a ton of time talking about that but just say is that i think that this business largely doesn't produce a lot of value for the company and the good news is they've had a recent leadership change and are focusing more on their what i see as their core business their biggest opportunity which is their software solutions and so that's oneir of revenue that's growing right around 10% uh i think that that will re accelerate next year which we'll get into in a minute but i want to take a step back and explain what their software solutions are these are tools that 70% of the top games on ios 70% of those game developers use to build their applications so uh this is something that it is uh from a market share perspective for most of the games they use unity software apple talks about unity often when they have different product announcements and partnering with unity their biggest competition is the unreal engine and that's owned by epic games it's of course the fortnite producer and when uh we think about unity it's think of this as kind of the mass market uh opportunity versus what unreal is doing which is some of those higher-end aaa games and what makes uh the unity engine and their software development so special is that it's uh it's more affordable for developers to build their applications it also makes it easier for them to distribute their applications on multiple devices each iphone for example each different operating system that people on the hardware needs little tweaks to make sure that these games are running properly and unity does a great job of that and so that's the that's the software solutions business and the reason why we're excited about that business longer term is we think the number of digital assets that we're going to have in our lives whether it's through gaming whether it's through incar entertainment whether it's through spatial computing what apple's building in vision pro the number of those digital assets is going to increase over time as people want more immersive whether it's t 2d or 3d compute experiences and unity is going to be a clear beneficiary of that last fall they made a change in their software solutions business where they changed how they are charging customers and that didn't go over very well and specifically is they announced that some developers who have free applications will be charged for using unity they've ended up reversing that and they have changed their ceo since then the new ceo wh hurst is next level he comes from red hat and has taken that off the table but they did leave on the table this opportunity to be aligned with developers and build a more sustainable subscription business on their software solutions and specifically what they're doing is uh sharing in the profits with uh some of these developers and they take a 2 and 1 half% cut of revenue for developers over a million dollars and so that is uh going to start to take effect that new runtime model is going to take effect in a new unity engine that's going to be out in the middle of this year and so we should start to see that benefit in 2025 and so that's one of the reasons why i talked about that 10% growth why i believe that that can ultimately accelerate next year is because of the benefit of some of these changes they've made around better aligning interest so unity wants these games to succeed the developer wants them to succeed they both win and unity will participate along the way so that's unity big picture here is this is an opportunity to invest in the concept of more immersive computing with a pix and shovels company that is the leading market share when it comes to building these pix and shovels for the majority of games and applications beyond games and on behalf of our current episode of frontier and center i'm jean bye for now
Pressure Points: Gene Munster on Amazon Earnings - Q3 2023,2023-10-26 23:43:01+00:00,6,yEBpbk1X6Gs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEBpbk1X6Gs,"we are not only visionaries but investors weÂ Â  invest in the future and our missionÂ 
is to profit from where the world is going one definition is little green peopleÂ 
but when you see an alien founder that youÂ Â  think they actually look like a littleÂ 
green person they're that far out of theÂ Â  ordinary and i would say this when you see anÂ 
alien founder you know you're seeing an alienÂ Â  founder it's not about a job it's not aboutÂ 
a career it is a calling steve jobs of courseÂ Â  famously wore the same clothes all the timeÂ 
and the reason why it was one more decisionÂ Â  he did not want to make every day and that isÂ 
alien-eske one of the advantages that we've hadÂ Â  in tech is our work on apple understanding howÂ 
steve jobs operates and his motives helped usÂ Â  identify elon musk as a similar type of alienÂ 
founder and ultimately is we use that templateÂ Â  as identifying future alien founders but whatÂ 
we found with our investments in these earliestÂ Â  companies is these alien founders have a wayÂ 
when they hit a wall to get through that wall so in deep water's office we have an old-schoolÂ 
high school 1980s scoreboard that you'd seen inÂ Â  a gymnasium when we ordered the scoreboard weÂ 
were moving to a new office and it turns outÂ Â  that it did not fit through the entrywayÂ 
of the building we paid about $400 forÂ Â  it easiest thing would have been to throw itÂ 
away but we decided we weren't going to stopÂ Â  there as a team we went and drilled out 210Â 
rivets within this scoreboard ultimately weÂ Â  came back as a team reassembled it inÂ 
the office and so the reason why thisÂ Â  is such a big part of our culture is weÂ 
recognize that there's going to be timesÂ Â  when the answer is not very clear but toÂ 
have that language embedded in our cultureÂ Â  really helps us when we hit those difficultÂ 
points to be creative about getting around it so i drink green death twice a day it'sÂ 
actually kale powder but about 8 years agoÂ Â  when i started drinking it i named it greenÂ 
death cuz you felt like you're going to dieÂ Â  after you drank it what it ultimately doesÂ 
besides the feeling of of being sick when youÂ Â  initially drink it half half hour an hour laterÂ 
you start to actually uh get like a a littleÂ Â  bit of a high off all of those good nutritionsÂ 
and it's a reminder for me to work through theÂ Â  pain to get to the gain that delayed rewardsÂ 
mentality something that i've had since i'm aÂ Â  kid and i just want to continue to do that soÂ 
green death is a daily reminder and somethingÂ Â  else that if you ever come to work with us atÂ 
deep water you got to do your shot of green death a visionary can see where the world is goingÂ 
can identify the companies that will benefit fromÂ Â  that an investor knows when to buy and sellÂ 
those equities, those companies and so that'sÂ Â  a differentiating point for us is the ability notÂ 
only to be visionaries but investors we invest notÂ Â  only in public companies and some of the biggestÂ 
tech companies but also startups and our abilityÂ Â  to look inside the these large mega companies andÂ 
understand what some of their weakness points areÂ Â  and to be able to find some of those smallerÂ 
companies that can help fill those the abilityÂ Â  to make that connection is something unique atÂ 
deepwater we actually go out on the street andÂ Â  talk to people about how they're using ai forÂ 
example or how they think about electric carsÂ Â  and we never miss an opportunity to do that ifÂ 
you'd spend a day with me it would become almostÂ Â  comical at the grocery store at people thatÂ 
i talk to when i'm in an uber talking to theÂ Â  driver i'm at a party i'm probably asking allÂ 
the questions and the reason why is i'm alwaysÂ Â  trying to get insights in terms of where theÂ 
world is going and what people want from thatÂ Â  future it's those types of things that satisfy ourÂ 
curiosity and allow us to make the best investment choices"
DeepTech315: Episode 3 - Azure vs. Google Cloud / Metaâ€™s AI push / Traditional Auto's planÂ for EVs,2023-10-27 17:33:27+00:00,21,5eQSuTEWE24,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eQSuTEWE24,welcome to pressure points i'm jean mster from deep water our topic today is tesla december quarter deliveries we'll start with a recap of the deliveries talk a little bit about margin and then jump into the pressure point which is expectations for tesla's market share in 2024 as for the numbers the delivery numbers they exceeded expectations they beat by a percent and a half if you're curious over the previous seven quarters so this doesn't include the just reported december quarter but takes us back to the beginning of 2022 tesla has missed consensus estimates by five times by an average of 4 and a half% they did exceed one quarter by 5% and came in line with one quarter of course the company doesn't give specific estimates for deliveries those are analyst expectations but in general over the last couple years we've seen slight misses on the delivery numbers where previous to that we were seeing beats on those and so that is has played into those slowing growth rates have played into pressure on margins and back in march of 2022 uh their gross margin xev credits was 29% and that's declined to 16.3% in the september 23 quarter that's been a slow gradual decline and that's typically what we talk about as the most important point related for for tesla is that profitability piece i believe that the numbers that we just saw for the december quarter is going to give some stability to that gross margin number and specifically i expect it to be essentially flattish maybe up slightly which even though that's not an impressive gross margin number 16.5% versus the industry at right around 10% and far from the peak it is showing the first signs of stability which i i think will be viewed as favorable by investors and so the general takeaway from the delivery numbers is a little bit better than expected that should be generally favorable for margin but i wanted to jump more importantly into the pressure point and this case it's related to what's going on with market share now tesla's ev market share in the us has been declining based on cox automotive ev market share trends they estimate that at the end of 2022 was around 65% and at the end of the september 23 quarter it was 50% i've seen other numbers that show them at 70% going to the high 50s either way you look at it they have been losing share and i believe they've been losing share for one big reason is that there was a lot of pend up demand in 2023 for people who are not tesla fans not tesla loyalists who love the car that they've had their volvo their bmw their ford and they're waiting for an ev alternative and when they got that in 2023 they bid and they bit and they bought and i think that ultimately had this call it a two-year pent up demand that had a negative impact on tesla's margins in 2023 now the general narrative is that this is the beginning of the end of tesla's market share dominance because there's just going to be more and more competition coming on and that's just going to chip away i don't believe we're we're going to see that in 2024 and part of the reason is that if you look at the velocity of new models coming out this year highly anticipated models it will be less than what was in 2023 by my estimate there were 10 key models some of those were from ford and volvo pollster came out um toyota in 2023 i think in 2024 we may see five of those models and one of the reasons why i'm expecting that slowdown is that these traditional car companies are slowing their pace of investment in evs it's something that we've been talking a lot about and this is the substance of those decisions that were made back in the fourth quarter of 2023 we'll start to see that in the pace of new cars coming out and also the availability it's one thing to have a car that's out and announce it's something else to be able to deliver on those vehicles actually produce them and i think the combination of that is going to create a lukewarm to down year for these competitors to tesla and i think the net of this is that we're going to tesla will essentially maintain their market share in 2024 now that's out of consensus most people think that it will drift into the low 4s but i think it's going to kind of maintain in that mid 50% range that's important because the more you can maintain market share as this market starts to re accelerate in 2025 the better positioned you are whether it's tesla or anybody else to act to capitalize on the economies a scale as the demand returns into evs which again i think will be in 2025 so putting it together i think that the results we saw with the december deliveries we're encouraging that 2024 is going to set up for a year where tesla is able to maintain their us market share and lay the groundwork for what i think is going to be a strong run for this company throughout the back half of the decade on behalf of deep water i'm jean bye for now
Pressure Points: Gene Munster on Apple's 'Scary Fast' Event,2023-10-31 01:54:59+00:00,3,aDcn9flGIHs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDcn9flGIHs,welcome to pressure points our topic is meta earnings before i jump into the pressure point i want to just quickly recap they beat revenue for the june quarter by a couple percent operating income by about 9% guided the september quarter to be if you assume they hit the high end of their range up 20% year-over-year and previously analysts had expected revenue to be up 15% so overall strong quarter especially in the face of what happened with uh youtube last week where expectation were for low 20% growth and it came in like at 133% growth so business is on track this of course is all noise related to the bigger a topic which is ai and um uh just before i jump into that pressure point i do want to mention zuckerberg said something on his prepared remarks which resonated with me and him commenting that many if not most tech ceos can't stop talking about ai and one of the reasons why it's just the most exciting thing going on i would to that i think it's the most exciting thing going on since the pc or potential electricity and so this is all relevant to what i believe will be continued a 3 to five year bull market here powered by ai i don't even think we've gotten out of the third inning in this and so let's jump into the pressure point which is the capex and specifically related to core versus generative ai and so cbex guidance was at the high they they kind of inched that up previously 30 5 to 40 billion for this year they said it's going to be 37 to 40 billion if they come at the high end of that range it will grow about 50% year over year and that tends to get investors anxious about what's the cost of this and are they spending too much and he basically put the zuckerberg basically put the hammer down and said that uh that you have to think about in the context they have core ai and then he talked about generative ai and core ai is getting some benefit from some of their infrastructure spend today that's basically infusing ai and all the existing products it's helping advertisers do more uh get a higher yield from their advertising better targeting better content creation it's uh helping recommendation engines things like that it's all important it's having an impact on their growth but it's not the most exciting part that zuckerberg talks about and he makes the distinction between generative uh uh or generative ai the the core versus generative and he uh describes this as being the real opportunity the big opportunity this is things like their ai studio product or meta ai this chatbot that they have that's still nent and they're kind of want to move those to a billion users years down the road he said but ultimately this is uh the biggest opportunity it's could be something related to llama and how they monetize that not only through consumers and advertisers but also through businesses and so that was the pressure point essentially telling investors don't worry about capex this is the right thing because the real holy grail here is generative ai opportunities and we haven't even seen it yet and i think most investors would leave that commentary feeling more confident in zuckerberg's vision and specifically the money that they're spending in ai so that's the pressure point i'll just throw on one postcript point which is related to reality labs this of course is the segment that has been losing a ton of money it's probably going to lose about 20 billion this year in operating income that's up from a loss of like 16 or 17 billion in 2023 so this is just they are just incinerating cash in this business and of course when investors think about this and think about the reality of what quest looks like and people don't get too excited about it it just continues to beg the question why are they doing this and zuckerberg shifted the conversation from kind of the quest to more of these glasses this is the rayband they're on their second version of the rayband through alonica that's their partner uh google also wants to partner with oxonic so i think that there's uh some tension between those companies and just a better understanding from both google and meta that there is this ambient computing wearable glasses opportunity taking computer vision and generative ai and uh that can really be a mass market product uh i think about what google showed at their developer day in the spring related to project astra and it it is that kind of an opportunity that i think is going to be profound when it comes to uh the future of reality labs so investors aren't ready for that they're not ready to get excited about reality labs i'm starting to get excited about it because i can see how this could be a mainstream product so uh that was the pressure point core versus generative overall uh solid quarter solid outlook and most importantly a compelling vision around ai that i think investors will continue to support and get behind on behalf of pressure points bye for now
Pressure Points: Apple September Quarter Earnings,2023-11-03 02:31:08+00:00,10,kXcjEZVU3Os,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXcjEZVU3Os,welcome to frontier and center our focus company this week is gitlab before we jump into that let's talk about the broader theme of frontier tech and as a reminder frontier tech are the themes and companies that are tech driven that are going to be changing our lives in the next 3 to five years and we measure how that theme is progressing based on the performance of the deep water frontier tech etf that ticker is l these tend to be smaller companies smaller relative to the context of the mega caps average market cap is $75 billion and so year-to date uh l is up 12% that's a similar gap that uh compared to the nasdaq which is up 10% and that gap is similar to what we've seen over the past several weeks so there basically hasn't been much change relative to frontier tech and the broader nasdaq and so that's the big picture let's jump in talk more about gitlab uh gitlab is a a ticker is gtb gtb it is a 9.5 billion doll market cap company and what this is is an application platform for developing software so it's a devops platform it's used typically by teams which can include developers and also management product development people to basically uh issue along and to manage the the life cycle of software development and the reason why this is in the etf is that we believe that the pace of software development aided by generative ai is going to accelerate which means the complexity of software development will accelerate therefore the tools and platforms needed to keep all that on track are going to become in greater need and therefore that's a benefit to get lab and so that's the biggest picture as far as taking a little bit step deeper into what exactly does that mean a devops platform is it takes care of things allows like software developer for example to get some code completion done so they don't actually have to know the exact script of code the uh ai can help do that that's a pretty common feature pretty common use case of ai today but that's built into the platform there also is issues tracker so if it would recognize that if there's some errors in the code that could cause the code to crash then it could flag that or potentially as you're developing the code they may be creating some security or compliance issues around that and so before this gets out in the wilder before it gets to the the qa team it is uh flagged by the the development platform uh as such and uh lastly is like version tracking is important piece as you develop software over years a lot of times you need to go back and look at different versions and uh you of course need this so basically any organization larger organization enterprise that's developing software which is basically anybody they're going to need a git lab or one of the competitors and so pretty clear use case here as far as the competitors they're going up against a behemoth and that being github uh they basically do the exact same thing and this of course is the company that microsoft acquired in 2018 at the time microsoft aquirium they paid about7 a5 billion dollars and right now gitlabs market cap is about 9.5 billion dollar during that time since microsoft acquired github the nasdaq is up about 110% so i guess if you kind of if you would take the route that github was still a public company they never got acquired and it went up in line with the nasdaq then this would probably be a$1 15 billion market cap my point is is that github is the incumbent we don't have exact numbers because now it's part of microsoft in terms of the amount of users but it is uh the bigger of the two and of course when it comes to that competitive piece the fact that get hub has an advantage being a microsoft product and being able to quickly tie into azure for example is a competitive advantage and last is that you don't get fired for implementing a microsoft product especially these days and so that is from a competitive standpoint gitlab does have an intense competitor but the tide is nicely rising there is one smaller competitor called bit bucket does a lot of the same things but uh it really centers down to competitively between github and git lab as far as how these uh products are priced basically they're monthly subscriptions and so in the case if we look at gitlab and github both of them have a free version and then they have kind of a a oneup tiered version uh they call it different things but that typically from a github perspective that's about $45 a month from git lab that's $20 a month and then the more premium version for github the microsoft product it's about $20 a month and about $100 a month for gitlab so actually it's a little bit more expensive for gitlab but the benefit is you don't have to have some of these other microsoft applications and you don't have to be kind of a broader microsoft customer to uh roll them out and so kind of on an apples to apples basis if you adjust for that they're priced pretty comparable um so from uh this i think of this opportunity is coke and pepsi i'll put get hub as coke get lab as pepsi but everybody's drinking more uh more soda so we uh here here we are with the kind of the rising tide related to both these companies when you go and look at the numbers in the last reported quarter get lab reported 33% revenue growth the streets expecting 26% growth this year year and 25% next year so gives you a sense about the grow trajectory this is kind of a steady grower in terms of the valuation on an earnings multiple it's a nose beder uh they're going to earn expected to earn 44 cents next year so this is trading at close to 130 times calendar 25 earnings that's hard to accept uh but there is a bright side to this when it comes to the revenue multiple it trades about 12 13 times which is consistent with other kind of these enterprise uh software application development layers if you think of like crowd strike for an example it trades closer at 14 15 times and essentially what investors are are voting is that eventually they're going to improve their margins and that is when the earnings multiple starts to decline and ultimately we believe that that does happen just want to leave one other piece that gives you a sense of the product competition valuation but one other piece to the story is related to the outcome here i think there are a lot of investors who believe that git lab is going to get acquired it would make perfect sense for uh google to acquire this to integrate with their cloud or amazon into aws uh even meta with could could use this as some product that goes along with llama ultimately the i think that that road is less likely there's been rumors recently that i think uh microsoft or google is going to buy hubspot that stock has traded up based on that but i just think given the regulatory environment it's probably not going to happen at least in the foreseeable future the next couple years and so i think you really have to uh own this and the reason why it is in the frontier tech etf is based on this fundamental belief more complexity in software it needs more tools to ensure that that software is effectively developed and and deployed so on behalf of frontier and center i'm jean bye for now now
DeepTech315: Episode 4 - Apple Earnings & AI / AI Regulation,2023-11-03 20:48:35+00:00,16,BjfHEfML8oU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjfHEfML8oU,"welcome to pressure points our topic today is when and to what extent will fsd have an impact on tesla's broader business and before i jump into it take a step back fsd more broadly has fallen below the fold from investors what they is on their minds in part because of the slowdown in tesla's business and also anticipation of this new lower price model in the next couple years along with what we've seen from gm and ford and some of their slowing down related to trying to crack autonomy the combination of those three have just put fsd on the back burner and on top of that we're we've had 11 versions of fsd and those who do use it tend to have mixed feelings about it it works most of the time but that one time when it uh has a jerky breaking it really freaks me out and therefore people don't want to fully embrace it and so the backdrop is fsd has fallen off of investors radar but it is worth uh revisiting this in part because a recent podcast from bill gurley and brad gerer that highlighted the changes that tesla is making in their training of the fsd model it is a wonderful podcast uh bg squar check it out and they highlight they spent about 20 minutes talking about all the changes to fsd training so i'm going to recap what they talked about and then shift to the pressure point which is what's the impact to the model so what they highlighted was a shift in the last 12 months from tesla to a training model called imitation learning model and effectively what that does is it recognizes that to improve autonomy you really have to focus on the edge cases and the best way to train the model with edge cases is to capture just the data around the edge case and one way you can do that is to use real people and look at driving behaviors on the road and when the car does something that is edge case related hard breaking hard steering it identifies that and then at night uploads that back to tesla to train the model and based on their belief or the conversation that they had with some of the tesla engineers is that the pace of improvement with fsd per month has gone up dramatically they highlighted 5 to 10x improvement per month now i don't know what it was before i don't know what metrics they're using to measure that improvement but it sounds good and if true which i believe it is true then that leads me to believe that we're inching closer to full self-driving availability and uh that timing piece is a critical point so i'm going to pause the conversation related to this uh the imitation learning model and uh i recommend checking out bill and brad's podcast and uh shift to how i think this the economic impact is going to play forward so my estimate right now is about 5% of eligible teslas have fsd or pain for it either upfront most ly or some through subscription the upfront it's $122,000 upf front for the lifetime if you buy it by subscription and do not have enhanced autopilot enhanced autopilot cost 6,000 if you opt out of an enhanced autopilot it's $199 a month if you have purchased advanced autopilot for six grand it is $99 a month so kind of bigger picture i think about this is a $200 a month product roughly and as i mention my estimate is at 5% adoption so i think that last year for example they had about 600 million in gap net income that came from fsd that compares to total gap net income in 2023 of 15 billion so call it uh a small percentage four or five% of total gap net income comes from fsd it's still a small piece but this obviously makes the question of what happens if this takes off and and that question the first point is the take off part for me is when is fsd really going to be a product that people want when's it going to cross the threshold where regulators are going to approve this product and i've been saying for the past few years we're five years away kind of this rolling five years so i'm going to move that up a little bit and say that by the end of 2027 based on some of this changes that they're making over the past last year tesla has in terms of training the model by the end of 2027 fsd will be available broadly in the us and if that ends up being the case uh we should uh start to see a increase in adoption because the product's just better and at the same time i think they need to lower the price as i mentioned those the different flavors of pricing today i think it needs to be at $100 a month so if we fast forward to 2027 at that point they should have about about 14 million vehicles on the road and if you take that price down to $100 i think a 25% adoption is a reasonable number and at that 25% adoption that's going to generate just under five billion about four and a half billion in gap income and if you play forward through our estimates to 2027 that would increase gap earnings by about uh 20% 20 z if you think the adoption rate's higher let's say 50% that would increase it by 40% and so that is the sensitivity from my perspective about how fs fsd can impact the model so i'm just going to recap what the highlights would be is number one tesla's making advances in terms of how they're trading fsd which opens up the opportunity for this to actually be available for the real world sooner in quotes by of 2027 my estimate second is i think that the price of it needs to come down for people to actually buy it and i think $100 is that magic price point and third if they get that 25% adoption by 2027 i think that that could increase their overall earnings by 20% now the benefits of this do go beyond this training model this training methodology do go beyond what they're doing with autonomy and the car and fsd because it can impact what's going on at optimus that's not what we're talking about on this episode we're just focusing on the impact so this does have a measurable impact it's going to take time patience will be a virtue and i think that ultimately it will benefit shareholders longer term on behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now"
Pressure Points: OpenAI's DevDay,2023-11-08 23:31:03+00:00,7,Mhnp-24GUUc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mhnp-24GUUc,[music] welcome to pressure points our topic today is previewing apple's march quarter they're going to be reporting on thursday may 2nd after the after the close and the pressure point is related to capex spending other topics we'll talk about is just the broader demand environment for apple and next we'll talk about ai products coming in the fall we'll preview what's going on with the capital return and lastly talk about regulation so bringing it to the top the pressure point is capex you might have to do a double take when you hear that because typically when we talk about apple we don't talk about the pressure point of capex but of course that was a narrative last week with big tech earnings in terms of how they are spending more related to capex and related specifically of course to be building generative ai apple in 2023 as we all know was uh surprisingly uh quiet on the ai front that's an understatement they never mentioned it in their prepared remarks on their earnings calls they would respond during q&a to questions around ai some of that secret secret or some of that uh kind of lack of willingness to embrace ai has changed in 2024 we're hearing them talk more about it on their earnings call and of course as they have previewed their developer conference in june they've made it clear to the world that this is going to have an ai focus and so when you hear ai focus you should think capex and in the case of some of these companies the mega caps are increasing their cap backs in 2024 by 50 to 90% and so apple hasn't said as much about that so i suspect that they will talk about that i think that that could come at the cost of a couple percentage of margin in 2024 and 2025 and as far as is that in the stock or not hard to say i am a shareholder i generally think that it's in the stock because if you're following along with the ai conversation you know to build generative ai you have to uh significantly increase capex but of course they historically haven't talked about that so hard to say how much of that is built in but i think investors should be dead centered focus on the capex part of the equation going into this quarter's earnings second topic now we're past the pressure point is related to demand the demand environment of course has been sluggish over the past uh couple years uh this quarter street's looking for revenue to be down 5% year over-year if you recall when they reported their december quarter they gave guidance for march when they talked about this decline they also emphasized that part of it was related to some difficult comps for some factory closings back around the covid period and so there is some noise if you back that out the business would be flattish for march still not measurable growth but either way you look at it sales are sluggish the iphone is expected to be down 10% year-over-year and china business is generally expected to be down 13 to 15% now china just under 20% of revenue and in the december quarter that business was down 10% and down 3% in september so we've seen the uh the trajectory around china worsening huawei is having a positive impact there's been a battery of thirdparty data out there saying that the iphone's going to have a difficult quarter so i think expectations difficult quarter in china so i think expectations for iphone are pretty muted going into this print the other piece around the demand equation is just other products the services segment expected to grow at 11% that's kind of consistent with previous quarters that continues to do well despite talk about changes in europe and lastly is vision pro this is a product that they're probably not going to say much about just say that they continue to be positive about in the future and they're not giving out existing uh metrics around it my sense going to end of this year was this was just a building year and don't expect much that this is for apple enthusiasts and developers and that has in fact been the case and i think that the one negative piece from my perspective at deep water we also have a venture business and the we just haven't seen the velocity of businesses that are apps for vision pro that are building around that kind of new companies that are coming out of the woodwork i was hoping to see a little bit more by this time but i think that the company is committed to this i'm still a believer in the concept of spatial computing and so the broader demand equation uh to to finish the thought about the demand part it probably troughs in the june quarter they probably give some punky guidance related to that and i think investors kind of feel that as a relief and may the stock may actually even trade up based on bad june because the back half of the year things start to get more optimistic with a new iphone in the fall we've had three relatively weak iphone cycles in a row so we're due for a better cycle comps are pretty easy and of course they could add some ai marketing em mojo around the next iphone which could be good for sales in the back half of the year so when you put that together demand soft but we should start to be able to see within arms reach that things should be improving kind of the mid single digit growth so that's the demand piece uh next we're going to talk about ai and what they will announce at wwdc i don't think they're going to say much on this call but just as a reminder we i'm at is that i think this is going to be more the new products are going to be more related to generative ai into existing products like into the os and to uh exist and to uh their notes products for example to messaging uh to be using generative ai around that uh making siri actually have a conversation with siri uh that would be nice and maybe some simple functionality where thirdparty apps like uber could build ai into it where you could ask your phone get me an uber to the airport and it would just take care of all that so i kind of put that as this stage one of apple and generative ai services and the second stage which is probably a couple years down the road is related to uh agentic ai or agent or personalized ai pick your uh the words that you want to describe this concept of ai doing more than just a simple task it would be you asking ai to do something and it actually goes and resolves my favorite example is um paint too much for my cable bill please go and renegotiate it um that is a a real possibility around agentic ai in the future and so we'll hear more most likely at wwdc related to what they're doing in ai next i want to talk about the capital return policy this is the period where they update it expectations are they're going to increase it by 90 billion that's pretty con that's the same number that they did a year ago so kind of a consistent increase and they've kind of had to do that just to keep cash kind of slowly going down their goal is to be net cash neutral which means their cash in their bank minus debt gets to zero and right now they're net cash positive at about 65 billion if they do the 90 billion that probably is going to get the net cash number at the end of of this year probably in the mid4 billion dollar range from the mid 60 at the end of december and so uh that's on the the capital return policy side and then last to talk about the regulation piece of course the department of justice with their claims uh really sent a shock wave uh i'm not going to get too much into this now but feel confident that this is falling below the fold for investors and it as well it should and the only piece i'll i'll discuss right now is just related to the timing of everything at a minimum uh they it probably won't go to trial until late 20 2 or early 2026 i'm going to do more on this but just kind of leave it with number one this is going to take a lot of time and number two i think the department of justice really doesn't have a case here and there may be some small changes that apple ultimately makes but i think that uh they're apple's in a great position and uh i think that they won't say much of anything on this probably reiterate that they feel that they are in a good position but beyond that i think that this is just kind of going to be department of justice more or less background noise for the near term so uh that's a wrap we'll see you after apple's earnings on behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now
DeepTech315: OpenAI DevDay / Grok / Humane AI,2023-11-09 22:31:35+00:00,16,pSvAW-1eKlA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSvAW-1eKlA,[music] welcome to pressure points we are previewing tesla's earnings that's going to be out after the close on tuesday april 23rd we of course got the delivery numbers earlier in the month i will recap those in a minute talk about automotive gross margins and then get to the pressure point which is the delivery numbers uh specifically delivery expectations some changes that will happen with the investor expectations in this street models after they report their quarter for 24 25 and 26 so it's about uh really the delivery numbers just taking two steps back of course tesla already reported the delivery numbers they were down 8% year-over-year that compared to expectations going into the announcement that they would be up 5% uh they grew at 19 18 19% in the december quarter so we've had this kind of slow trajectory downward and it probably you probably don't need reminding but it was just five quarters ago where elon was talking about 50% compound growth for a decade that would mean that you're growing faster in the earlier years call it 60 70 80% so this has been a remarkable slowdown a thought on the slowdown i think what happened is that simply there was a ton of demand pulled forward and i didn't realize this when it was going on but i think over the past few years there were people who had been thinking about getting an electric car who maybe were caught up in some of the excitement who typically buy a car once every 5 years they pulled that forward bought it in three years and two years and now they're good and i think that the rest of the world is slowly moving towards electrification i believe that it is better evs are better because of cost of ownership because of performance uh there is debatably an environmental impact on them but and the big picture is i think that they are superior to gas cars so eventually i think that the tide is going to move in tesla's favor and of course they've been doubling down on that future where traditional automotive companies have been slowing their pursuit of that but i think that is what has happened with the delivery numbers why they been so bad i don't see those bad delivery numbers as a reflection on elon's brand maybe that had a little bit to do with it but keep in mind for every person that is turned off by elon uh there's probably someone who is turned on by some of the things that he says and so kind of think of that generally as a wash but that's just some context in terms of the delivery numbers now shifting to a couple topics for the call one is the automotive gross margins x credits and normally this would be the pressure point and it's the pressure point because it is at the battle at the the front line of the battle between is tesla a car company or a tech company a higher margin would support the thesis that this is a tech company and deserves a higher multiple seven times revenue much higher than the current m multiple cap longer term uh if you believe this is just a car company then it deserves a much lower multiple and the best indicator that would be to look at margins and those gross margins have been declining over the past year and a half they peaked right around 29% it's been generally a steady trend down uh in the december 23 quarter it was 17.2% that was a slight uptick from september 23 were at 16.3% so we saw a little bit of a bump but in general that trend has not been tesla's friend on the gross margin side put it in the context traditional auto is just above 10% so there's still a little bit of advantage that tesla has but that gap has closed meaningfully over the past several quarters and so the reason why this is not the pressure point going into tonight is i think that or going into their print is that i think investors are wanting to know just more holistically what's going on with overall demand and separately is that the street analyst have made some adjustments already about their expectations for gross margin and this is based on fact set numbers but it looks like facts that or facts that is showing that the street is looking for automotive gross margins to decline throughout the year 15.9% for march going to uh 13.5% kind of in the fall and ending the year right around 15% as i mentioned they did 17.2% in the december 23 quarter so the street's looking for declining margins for 25 calendar 25 very similar types of margins x credits right around that 25% and for 26 the street is bumped that up to 177% but the summary here is that when it comes to gross margin the street's basically saying it's going to take two and a half years 3 years to get back to where we were in the december 23 quarter and so that to me says there's a good uh dose of conservatism that's been injected into the models i feel good about where that's at relative to uh what i think they're going to talk about on their call the piece that i do not feel good about and as an investor in tesla i embracing for the stock to go lower after they report their quarter the piece i do not feel good about is their commentary on deliveries for the balance of the year and this is the pressure point we talked about the delivery numbers and based on the fact accent numbers they still the street still hasn't fully adjusted what i think is for the reality of what the business is going to look like in 2024 if you take their reported delivery numbers in march and you grow that 10% sequentially throughout the year it gets you to about a 6% decline in deliveries in 2024 and the streets look currently looking for a 5% increase based on the fact set fact set numbers so to me that says there's about a 10% re downward revision that needs to happen in 2024 and most likely analyst will just kind of roll that through through 25 and 26 and so think of the forward revenue numbers more or less coming down by 10% uh when they after they report their quarter i think that's probably going to be viewed as a negative and just continue to uh beg the question with investors when are we going to pull out of this funk uh i do believe there is a clear case again for evs i think tesla embracing this versus what traditional auto has been retreating from the undeniable of electrification i think that will bold well for their market share in the future and show a reacceleration so i do expect 25 to be up higher than 24 and 26 higher from 25 26 of course is where things could get more exciting around the robo taxi but will hold off on talking about that till the 8th of august so that's the pressure point is the delivery numbers do have a postcript to this episode a quick thought on that event in august undoubtedly it's going to get some attention on the call i suspect they will just talk about what they're doing maybe show some renderings about what they're doing keep in mind in 2019 they talked about robo taxi elon said a million by the end of 2019 on the road uh they did about 1.8 million vehicles in total in 2023 obviously to say that didn't happen is an understatement so investors are probably going to look at a lot of the commentary from autonomy day with a little bit of a a jaded eye but i do think that this is a brilliant move to shift to more of a razor razor blade model i do expect that autonomy is going to have a breakthrough generative ai type of moment where people don't think it's close and all of a sudden it gets a lot closer and becomes reality and we've seen lot of that with the most uh improvements in the updates more recently so i'm optimistic about where that ultimately is going to go i'm not optimistic about how the stock is going to react going into this print i hope i'm wrong i'm not making a a hard call on what's going to happen with the stock i do think numbers do need to come down though for the deliveries for 24 25 and 26 we'll be back after the report on behalf of of pressure points bye for now
Pressure Points: Microsoft Ignite,2023-11-15 23:05:39+00:00,5,bzmcOsgMgm0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzmcOsgMgm0,welcome to deep tech 315 our first topic this week is tesla earnings what do we need to take away from it uh for those of you who haven't been following along as closely tesla at a miss on the bottom line the all important metric of gross margins x ev credits came in at 14.6% that's 200 basis points below where the street is at in any normal quarter the stock would have been down 15 20 20 uh 15 20% based on that type of a miss on that important metric but a lot of the tesla story is about what's to come and of course that's related to these new models two or three models in october that we'll hear about and then what happens with fsd fleets autonomy optimus and there was a comment in their investor deck that said that expect that the robo tax is going to come after this next generation vehicle that production is going to start around mid 2025 so i want to put context elon head said three months ago is going to be early 2025 or maybe even 24 so that's a little bit of a slip and then some more color that the robo taxi is going to have this new unbox manufacturing approach which means that it's a bigger buildout on the production side which probably means the robo taxi sees the light of day i'm gonna say late 26 or early 27 so combination of those two tesla stock took it on the chin down 133% what were you thinking i think uh all those things are right and if i put tesla alongside google which we'll talk more about in a minute part of it i think is people looking for reasons to sell big tech um and i agree with you i think that tesla there there is still this fundamental question that feels like it's outstanding around what's the real demand in the ev space we were kind of maybe hoping it was sort of bottoming bottoming last quarter um now with the question around the gross margin maybe that open up the potential that uh yes we bought them but maybe price needs to continue to kind of iterate to recoup some of this demand um so that's going to be an open question prior for the next let me ask the question on the ev let me interrupt there is at the end of the call elon reiterated a comment that he said before which basically is do not own tesla if you do not believe that they'll get to autonomy everything else is noise and uh i guess the positive side of that is if you believe that they'll get to autonomy then you should invest in tesla but this idea that he's almost like dismissing their whole i mean you need the cars out there to do autonomy but he's downplaying that hardcore on the the car side do you think he really believes that is he is he truly believe that that's just noise uh or is is uh there's there's something bigger that opportunity around electrification i so number one i think he does believe that number two i think this is one of those examples of this great f scott fitzgerald quote about the test of a first rate intelligence is holding two contradictory things in your mind at the same time and i think that's exactly what we're seeing here the fundamental business of tesla making the best evs in the world there are questions around that that haven't been answered and that probably will persist for a couple more quarters now given what we've see with this gross margin question right at the same time if your investment horizon is many years autonomy is the only thing that really matters i think that probably is true but over the next matter tesla or mals for any car maker like what let's say we do get to an autonomous world and ford is ditch argo and and they're fumbling their way forward on that uh cruz i guess just started up again right but wayo they google had some positive comments about that was going but in general i feel like tesla i i don't think that's the same though because no other carmaker is valued like tesla too there there is something built into tesla you're talking about i'm talking about the viability you're talking about viability yeah well i and and those might be two different questions and ultimately you know does fsd becomes something just like we saw with charging that they license to ford that license to uh gm that might be the endgame and that's probably good for tesla it might mean that those companies survive too if we're just talking about companies not stops they did that question came up alex potter from piper asked that about the licensing piece and they said it's a basically it's a few years away and it's a long road to have have that happen i interrupted you you're on a roll there i want to i want to t the last word on tesla but i want to give you a chance to it's this concept of the contradictory things and i think we we've talked about this a lot tesla's such a religious stock you know if if you're a tesla believer you know they can't do anything wrong and i think it is true that if they solve autonomy over the long run that probably should be good for the stock in the shorter run though the bears might have a case and say look you know the gross margin is eroding a little bit maybe that persists maybe it doesn't who knows we've got the robo taxi event coming up that got pushed once already and so in my mind there's probably some potential for volatility because of the questions around the ev corps and then ultimately just what does elon say that we don't already expect coming out of this robo taxi event that can right get the stock going again my take i believe that they are going to be one of the first to significantly monetize tonomy i think that is a function of time before that happens and i'm still a believer in that religious kind context i believer i i do my best to be levelheaded about this be critical of the company point out that there was an ugly margin quarter i still think that the foundations of why you own this uh is intact jump to second topic is related to google recap there is that they came in line with earnings they beat operating profit by 7% stock was up a couple percent in after hours trading and then on the call they talked about uh some tough comps they talked about some a little bit of a dip in margin and the near term because they ped some products forward and a change in depreciation and they also had some what i think were some confusing comments related to uh what's going on with the capex and confusing in the sense that they capex succeeded what analysts were expecting but they reiterated to kind of use that q1 of 24 as the baseline and expect it to grow which could imply that we're kind of have flat around 12 13 billion per quarter and some investors maybe saw that as a reason that that we're starting to see some slow down in cap backs and so that was the setup yeah and this really gets back to uh that initial comment around people looking for reasons to sell i mean i thought the google quarter was generally fine it didn't feel like the kind of quarter that's up 14% it was 14% in march so that was strong little miss on youtube down 6% felt like an excessive reaction given what happened um but but i think it's it's maybe an indicator of just the regime we've been in for the last couple weeks with tech in general like investors have been skittish they've been quicker to sell than to buy it hasn't been a you know buy the dip kind of a thing and we've talked a lot about this uh the last week or two but you look back at the dotc era 94 to 2000 11 pullbacks of 10 plus percent or more we haven't had one pull back of 10 plus per in the nasdaq in the last down 8% as we're there yet that's the crazy thing it feels like we're down a lot more than that and we haven't even hit 10 um and in our view i mean i think we still both believe that we're early in this ai cycle this ai bull market so we're going to have 10% pullbacks along the way this won't be the only one if we're right that we ultimately get that dot level bubble in the end love it i'm gonna read a uh a quote from this is from mark zuckerberg yesterday in a bloomberg podcast and this is related to capex he said the downside of being behind is that you're out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years suar had kind of similar comments about this and doug you've written a lot about just the importance of the understanding what's going on on capex to get a better sense about how the ai trade is going to play out and if you could just expand on that it's this sort of logical reality and now like you said both ceos of meta and google are alphabet are are admitting to it but i i think of it like a pascalian bet so blae pascal has this theory about whether or not you should believe in god and if you believe in god and there is a god you go to heaven if you don't believe in god and there is a god you go to purgatory but what's the punishment right if you get it wrong there's really no reward for not believing in god m and i think ai is the same case here you know the reward would be it save 100 billion dollar but who cares that's and i think that's the contrarian idea which is so funny to say who cares about saving hundred billion doll in the context of a three trillion dollar market cap company it doesn't move the needle even a little bit but 100 they got 80 billion 100 billion in cash i guess you're spreading that over a couple years be over several years right i mean google's going to do 50 billion in capex year let's just say half of that right is ai we're talking about a four five year investment cyle so they definitely have the know to do it they do and you look again you look at the mag six so exclude tesla just because they're smaller in comparison for capex um the mag six will spend something like $225 billion on capex this year that's going to be almost 40% growth for the mag 6 but the mag 6 is also going to generate about $420 billion in free cash flow so it's not like they are dipping into being unprofitable or even break even right these companies have plenty of money to deploy and i think that's what sometimes gets missed when we think about the timing of well when are we going to see ai revenue mark zuckerberg sundar pai you know all of these ceos i think they're thinking about things in different time scales we talked about the length of time it might take for tesla to bring some of these autonomy products to market i think they'll do it it's going to take time i think the same thing is true for ai but they have to invest ahead of that to be ready for it and just to finish the thought out is if they continue to invest for longer than we expect let's say the next three four years big tech and then beyond that sovereign industry uh then uh at least the hardware part of the ai trade will stand up and then what gives us time to kind of build a software trade software had a nice result with service now kind of talking up their numbers a little bit saying they're starting to see uh average revenue per user improve a little bit from this stock was up like 13 15% on on that news and so that's the kind of the substance of it is that more spending on infrastructure we're going to have that ai moment whether it's in one two three or 10 years agree 100% it will be a magical moment and i think you know when you when you think of these companies that kind of technological paradigm shift is what moves the needle like for so long we've talked about how can apple move the needle and that's why we talked about the car so much when they were still working on that project it's because because it was sizable enough to move the needle on a multi hundred billion dollar revenue company ai is that same thing and that's why all these companies do need to invest in the chance they get it right because it will move the needle last topic breaking news related to open ai coming out with a search product not really breaking news for people who been following the storyline been long rumored that they're going to to do this uh google shares dip back a little bit on that news uh all i'll kick it off and give you the final word is that when you test these models their intelligence are so close and at deep water we've done some of this testing it's not 10 times better it's not going to be enough to get those almost four billion people who use google search on a daily basis to switch their behavior over to open ai and so this uh from my perspective is going to feed into the narrative that google has a big problem on their hands around how to navigate search forward but i think it's ultimately going to be noise i agree this stocks down a couple percent as we speak it did react to the news i think the reality is you hit the magic words on the head the 10x better thing seeing just the video because it's not in the li live yet that we can actually test but seeing the video of what search gpt looks like it looks kind of like a google ai overview but maybe a little bit cleaner it's it didn't seem 10x better than what i'm seeing from google and ai overviews which i already by the way expect and kind of look for um and so unless chat pt can do something unique something more than they show it in the teaser it's hard to see why people would be fleeing from google for any reason final question this just broke i have not had a chance to look at that trailer of the the teaser was there any indication about how they would monetize not yet no but my guess is they probably do something similar to what google's doing with overview right you put you put an ad somewhere in the stream that's relevant to the context infinite monkey theem yeah all right we'll leave it on that i'm sure that topic will uh be an a topic for next week on behalf of this week and doug and i bye for now
DeepTech315: MSFT Ignite / OpenAI Subs / Redwood Deal,2023-11-16 21:07:43+00:00,14,nwNYmGkzKVU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwNYmGkzKVU,i'm gene and the topic is apple's fall event three key takeaways first is this was enough to get the business back to growth the incremental updates related to iphone 15 and the pro and pro max models are going to be enough i think to return apple to growth and the reason is that the base of old iphone owners continues to grow it's more than 400 million today that base compares to street expectations of 220 million iphones to be sold over the next year so that is a big enough pool for them to meet or exceed the iphone estimates over the next year and when those people are upgrading to iphone they're not upgrading typically from iphone 14. the average upgrade is from iphone 11 and it's important to put the context of these feature improvements against iphone 11 camera for example which is a big selling point iphone 11 it was a 12 megapixel camera in this case it is a 48 megapixel camera for iphone 15. and that incremental shift that incremental update is material and i think we'll get people to move and upgrade second is a second important topic was related to spatial photos and video this was a feature that most were not predicting want to give deep waters andrew murphy credit he did anticipate that this was going to come and it showed up on the iphone 15 pro and pro max models this effectively is the new way that people are going to be capturing memories i think it's a big deal when i did the vision pro demo back in june it's the feature that stuck out to me most what apple is doing here is they're adding the ability to capture those videos with the high-end iphones you'll still need the vision pro which comes out early next year to view those but you can now capture it with a phone which is going to dramatically increase the amount of videos that people can capture i suspect people will go around capture the videos in spatial and then come home put on the vision pro headset and check it out this is one you're just gonna have to trust me on this uh these videos uh are amazing it is going to be a different way for people to recall memories it was an important feature that was not anticipated today third piece was related to ai and apple doesn't talk a lot about ai but it was clearly at the event two forms one is the a17 chip that's going to go onto the pro models that essentially is going to be better at inferencing again apple didn't talk about it in ai context but when they went through the specs it was clear that's what this chip does chips are important to power these ai experiences and separately is within watch they from his known watch and a small update to the ultra but both of those are going to have the ability to double tap they call it to basically control your watch so for example if you want to answer call you go like that answers the call and can create other gestures with your hands that can play and pause music for example so that's a unique way only ai can make that experience happen and they're adding those to the watches the ps part those the top three the postscript was jeff williams he played a big role in the first 30 minutes of this they focused on the watch even though the watch wasn't one of the mainstream even though he does not focus on the watch he of course is the chief operating officer and the company continues to elevate his visibility which i think is a smart succession planning for apple long term so in a nutshell the pressure point is iphone 15 is going to be enough to return apple to revenue growth in the december quarter on behalf of pressure point i'm gene bye for now
Pressure Points: Cybertruck Preview,2023-11-17 18:28:45+00:00,7,pb1it0cxvMQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb1it0cxvMQ,welcome to pressure points i'm jean mster our topic is nvidia earnings before we jump into the pressure point i want to give some context about what the quarter and the outlook were like in terms of the quarter it was as expected impressive they beat on top and bottom line but of course in any company and especially with a company like nvidia that's grown so fast the stock is up so much over the past year all eyes were on the january revenue guidance they did as expected raise guidance by 11% however uh there was whisper numbers that they were going to raise guidance by 15 to 20% so as soon as that guidance came out the stock was down 4% and then gained some of that back when in their press release there was some commentary about a headwind in china sequentially from october to january because of some of these regulations that are being put in place by the us government and their ability to sell chips to china so the stock then was down 1% and kind of held that level throughout the earnings call and then during the call the question came up related to a little bit more detail about what is the impact of these restrictions on the china business and cfo colette crest simply said that there is a substantial impact and unfortunately we don't know what that exact number is the percentage decline it's going to decline but in my book substantials down we'll call it 30% and i also believe that most analysts had expected that the china business would be impacted by some of these uh regulations but would have expected the but we're modeling for the business to be flat from october to january and so if you take that adjustment essentially and say that there was effectively a billion dollar headwind if that their data center business is down 30% sequentially that would be a a1 billion sequential headwind to the business if you add that back to their guidance they would have guided up 18% uh versus where the street was at going into the print and that falls right in line with kind of those whisper numbers that i was talking about that plus 15 to 20% and so when you put it together i think adjusting for china it's essentially they hit the whisper number a high whisper number they delivered on it and uh makes sense that uh the stock it would make sense to me that the stock would rebound slightly tomorrow i think it turns green as long as the broader market's positive i think that nvidia will be green after everything is said and done but not up much because it essentially was in line with that whisper number so that's a little bit of context on the very near term but the most important part now we're shifting to the pressure points was of course what is the sustainability of growth for the data center segment this is 75% of the business it will grow at 300% right around 300% in the january quarter so this just remarkable growth in this segment and this is driven of course by everything that's happened especially driven by what microsoft is doing with azure amazon with aws meta and some of their build outs and google with their cloud and these hyperscalers are the ones that are really pushing demand for these gpus that are impac in the data center business so that is what is powering it near term but the key question did come up on the call uh which was do you think you're going to grow your data center business in calendar 25 and jensen uh did not miss a beat i'm going to read you his exa exact language he said absolutely i believe the data center can grow through 2025 he did say through 2025 i think that that nuance was because that that was how the question was was worded my guess is he believes it can continue to grow in 2026 and beyond too because he gave a compelling case of why this can continue and when i heard it i put a a filter on it which was this guy is as amped up about ai and the hardware and infrastructure side as anybody in the world so you need to be careful about what he's saying essentially but his case was that the hyperscalers still going to take years to build out what their infrastructure is but there's going to be additional ways on top of this one is going to be enterprise spending a second is going to be nations spending and csps uh building out their networking infrastructure uh regional governments uh if you think about coalition like europe for example they're spending on on um on ai and building these models and inferences and so when you look at that context tex and you layer on top of that my view which is ai will exceed the hype ultimately it makes sense that we're still early in this uh buildout and that they business can continue to grow on the data center side going into the print the street was looking for data center growth of right around 20% for calendar 25 in my sens is after all the analysts go through their models they're probably going to end up at a similar place for 2025 right around calendar 25 right around that 20% growth that feels like the real number 26 probably steps down to 15% so the bottom line is that i think that the jensen presented the proper case that this ai party can continue and so he did close the call and and talked about how nvidia is going to be uh benefiting beyond just the data center uh their cpu business some of their network and software businesses and that's all nice to hear but the reality is that the pressure point on nvidia at least for the foreseeable future the next two three calls is going to be uh solely focused on that data center business putting it all together nvidia's october quarter and january outlook was impressive it met high expectations and the company continues to be well positioned to have really impressive growth over the next couple years as they're one of the key uh infrastructure builders for this paradigm shift that's a wrap for pressure points i'm jean bye for now
DeepTech315: OpenAI Recap / Outlook / Impact,2023-11-20 22:46:11+00:00,14,gMcQeHuGyDs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMcQeHuGyDs,welcome to pressure points our topic is nvidia earnings i'm going to start with a broader recap and then hit the pressure point which is what is this company's growth going to look like in 2025 that is calendar 2025 taking a couple steps back as of the time of this recording shares of nvidia are up about 6% in the aftermarket that compares to up about 3% when the numbers came out the stock did rally during the conference call in particularly on a comment from jensen that said i quote we will see a lot of blackwell revenue this year so confirming that the timing is in fact this fall and also that the magnitude is going to be more than i think what some had expected so that's where we lie right now plus 6% my senses that the stock continues to gain momentum in the days and weeks to come because the party is feels like it's just uh getting started and uh that ultimately is uh back to the pressure point which is what does that growth look like in 20205 so going into the call i was talking about the osborne effect this of course is the phenomenon when a new product is announced that's not yet available the existing product the demand for that uh slows and what we saw with nvidia's results is the osborne effect did not kick in in fact that the hopper demand and continued to be robust they beat the top line by 6% and they also guided up for revenue in the july quarter was 5% higher than where the street was at so they're bucking the osborne effect that is all positive for this calendar year but again back to the pressure point what does that mean for calendar 25 and as a setup for calendar 25 is the street is looking for as at the time of the report for 26% growth that's going to probably inch up after analysts think about what happened to maybe plus 28% but that is down measurably from the 107% expected growth this july quarter and the 260 is% growth they just reported in the april quarter so you can see this this downward trajectory understandable that these growth rates are coming down dramatically because when you're cing up against what i think is the most incredible comps that i've ever seen uh 260% comps it's understandable that the growth rate does decline so don't hold that against nvidia the declining numbers what matters is will they grow in fact faster than the 28% next year uh my sense is that they will and uh the biggest reason is i do believe uh that this uh party if you will is just getting started i am wearing the closest thing that i have to a party shirt to to reflect that view and ultimately i think that if uh we continue to see the type of demand through i think these four chapters that jensen talked about of the buildout of uh this ai industry that he referred to so as a reminder the first phase is related to training and inference that's where we're beginning next is enterprise then he talks about heavy industry and also sovereign ai so these are kind of this he's building the case that we're just getting started and and in fact i do believe that that's the case so when we put all this together the pressure point related to growth in 2025 i think that this gives me increased confidence that we're going to see uh faster than expected growth for longer with nvidia uh i'm going to pause there with the pressure point then just kind of clean up some other important topics and in no particular order i talked about china they said that it continues to be competitive and expected to decline year-over-year in this current quarter the i think that that view is almost identical to what they said last quarter so continues to be challenging in the q&a it came up and jensen said basically it's a small part of our business and if you look at the broader business we're continuing to see great growth which is true and so it's kind of now at a point where maybe it's small enough that we shouldn't worry about it uh was kind of the uh the uh the underlining message uh they uh they did reference uh you know again this concept that we're kind of 5% of the way through it at least in terms of some of the buildout and that speed is of the essence with their customers i mean they've got all the greatest customers in the world and speed is of the essence and this plays into the concept of the again back to this osborne effect of speed versus the new chips and what it's clear is that they are going to be coming out with with new chips on an annual basis and the uh if they can hold to that and release schedule that essentially diffuses the whole osborne effect if customers know that they're going to get a new chip in a year uh and it's the beginning of the year they're really not missing out much by buying it now that's very different than a company that upgrades their product once every two or three years then when you start to get closer to that upgrade cycle you really see a big drop off in demand so putting it all together this annual upgrade piece along with just the intensity that their customers have in terms of speed is uh lays the ground work to i don't think we're going to have some big hiccup some big miss i think kind of going into the fall i think that that was drisk here one uh last piece kind of in the other category is just what's on the mind of the customers and uh jensen did a good job of explaining this the concept of the race that is going on on and the need to get to the next uh platform ahead of everyone else if you're first he said you make a breakthrough if you're second you're 2 or 3% better than the breakthrough and it really just doesn't matter and so i think that really captured uh the spirit that is that is in play here and when you wrap all this together i come back to this is great for nvidia but also great for i think the broader tech market i do continue to believe this is yet another data point that we're in the early stages of a 3 to 5year bull market that will end in a spectacular bursting of a bubble but i still think we are early in that p in that cycle so on behalf of deep water and this episode of pressure points bye for now
Pressure Points: NVIDIA Earnings,2023-11-22 01:51:54+00:00,7,5H448N2y6T0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H448N2y6T0,welcome to this week's episode of deep tech 315 that's doug i am jean our three topics today are apple exits the car business next we're going to talk about figure uh robotics late stage private company that uh is gting a lot of attention and last we're going to talk more about google some of the things that they're navigating and what this means for x. aai and we'll go back to the top dog apple announces doesn't announce but through mark german at bloomberg his astute reporting uh that apple is exiting the car business i had a flashback to may of 2017 where i long prophesized that apple would do a television and that is when it was reported that apple was ending its bid to build an actual television it taught me an important lesson that apple can work on projects but that doesn't necessarily mean that they will see the light of day and so i was dead wrong 100% dead wrong wrong when it comes to apple television when it comes to the car i was saying it was a coin toss whether or not that was going to see the light of day even though publicly i was saying it was a coin toss internally i was thinking it was greater than a 50% chance just given the level of investment that apple had put into this product by my estimates a billion dollars per year now that may seem like small relative to what we're hearing thrown around in the ai world but in apple's product world this is real money that they're putting to this for almost a decade but the reason why i wanted to talk about this is outside of them getting out of the business to me it really begs a question uh they want to focus more on artificial intelligence here steve jobs in 2007 just before the iphone came out announced that they were delaying a product uh the leopard one of their mac oses because they wanted to put more focus on getting the iphone ready for june 2007 launch and he let off that press release saying that life has tradeoffs and this was the best in this case uh it sounds like apple is navigating the trade-off between building a car or pushing more into generative ai i think life is about tradeoffs and i i think the car example is the perfect uh story about that when whenever you're predicting that something's going to happen you're putting odds on it this is how odds work when you see a company like apple investing billions of dollars into a car the odds are they're going to do something with it same with the television i don't think it's wrong to have expected that those things were going to come because the odds suggested that they were going to come uh being a contrarian is great when you go against the odds usually contrarians are wrong when they're right they're really right so that's why being contrarian is interesting as it pertains to ai i think that this is probably the right decision for apple obviously if they didn't think the car was going to make it and market and be impactful um i think that's a signal in and of itself but the reality is we're in an ai age and that wasn't necessarily the case when they started investing in project titan several years ago i think that that's something that's really emerged more over the last you know year 16 18 months and so apple had to recognize that in the marketplace uh it doesn't matter what the odds say when the situation around the game changes and i think they probably made the right decision yeah i really wish they would have been able to do both of them understand that there are tradeoffs and i think that the timing of this ending this project is related to ai they've had other opportunities they've reworked the business by my account had three changes of leadership over the past decade they've had significant redirections in what they're focusing on within titan and so the idea of turmoil and titan is ne is not new but i think the fact that the project was killed is related directly related ated to ai and it for me begs the question about then uh first on the topline growth piece is that apple's business hasn't grown over the last six quarters i think it's a steady state business it should grow right around 5 per. one of the reasons why i was excited about the cars it's a large addressable market you know how much i love big tams and in this case by my math that they got 10% of the automotive market that could have increased their overall business by about 60% pretty big lever there and i i think uh this kind of gets me to believe that to for investors just to think about apple's topl line is more or less around 5% but do you think that generative ai in different forms can be a step up in terms of apple's overall growth rate like we go back to the concept of odds um i don't think apple probably thought it could get 10% of the global auto market i think that estimation to me feels high uh luxury product right i mean we're talking about tesla battling its way for more than a decade now to try to get to 10% so internally everything about how is apple thinking about the odds of is it worth it to keep investing in this auto opportunity that has some t behind it or this opportunity around ai that has some attached tam to it my guess is they were probably thinking they get some number lower than 10% given it'd be a luxury product so maybe it's three or four or five or something like that so i just want to set the frame work that's probably a smaller number than that estimation if you put it in that context i do think that you have to then do the math of if we add really compelling and unique ai features to the iphone could that accelerate sales cycles the most popular smartphone in the world um that might be something that really does move the needle meaningfully uh relative to you know a a new car a new product um that wouldn't have uh as as quick of a sales cycle as the iphone yeah on top of that you can have like we have discussed in the past is general of ai related to personalized ai which we think we'll get a the first preview at at wwdc this year and so that potentially could be a subscription type of business longer term or just like you said kind of embedding more of generative ai into their core products they still haven't figured out search and i'm not talking about search like internet search just search on apple devices through texts across board i think that that is still a measurable pain point at least in my life and i love for them to see that making that better in their products would want me to upgrade more often and so it's funny i got trye in and say it's on on twitter now x there are a bunch of people who are responding to this story about apple focusing more on gener of ai and basically just saying please just make siri functional like that would be a huge w so the bar is low on siri for for whatever that's worth yeah pretty much does timers and weather today is a low bar and i look forward to them stepping comfortably above that at least laying that groundwork this summer we're going to shift to our second topic which is a company that maybe uh some of you haven't heard of it's figure uh they are a humanoid robot think of like optimus prime they just raised optimus prime but a from a private company that obviously optimus prime being tesla's humanoid they just raised how much was it doug 5 675 67 five $2.6 billion valuation and elon talks about this as just a massive long-term probably the biggest opportunity just because it changes the whole structure of economies when you start to really automate labor across the board and i was uh uh kind of thinking this in the context of what is tesla investing and quick reminder tesla's ramping up their capex they're overall investing pretty significantly they're at 85 billion for 2023 in capex they're going to 10 billion this optimus plays a little bit into this going to 10 billion for 2024 or more exceed 10 10 billion and they hinted at their analyst day last year that it would be on a run rate of 20 plus billion per year going forward and so when i see this i think david versus goliath here figure versus optimus prime is that the right way to think about it or do you think a smaller company got a ton of money can compete with something what elon's trying to build with optimus i think the competition will be hard but i think it's also valuable i mean it's it's uh analogous to probably another topic we'll get to in a minute but google the huge well uh capitalize cash flow generating incumbent in ai versus open ai the scrappy startup that uh arguably over the past couple years has taken the lead from google um so you never really know what can happen in markets when you give a decent amount of capital to a creative scrappy team that's really just focused on one thing that's kind of the magic i think with startups and so i think again let's go back to our conversation odds is like the theme of our deep tech today the odds are probably that optimus has a better shot at winning the market than figure but uh if you're a contrarian maybe there's uh maybe there's something to that yeah and through our venture investing like you said is anytime you're raising more than 500 million that's that's enough money to keep things moving in the right direction so wish them all the best because i think the concept of a humanoid is a powerful impact on really taking ai to the physical world so our final topic is a carryover from last week this is the gift that keeps given for deep tech 315 which of course is google as a reminder deep water we are frustrated investors investors currently frustrated with google and doug you written a lot about this i led your piece you did last weekend when you talked about is google dead or and uh love for you just to kind of recap that thoughts and and what we learned this week relative to how google is navigating some of the challenges they've had with their ai being i would say off track i promise we didn't plan this uh beforehand but the takeaway from the is google dead piece is that the odds are still that they should be uh a big time player in ai if not the winner why is that because they have obviously number one back to the point of capital hugely uh free cash flow generative business they can fund any amount of investment they ostensibly want to do in ai whether that's an infrastructure whether that's in building new software um so they've got capital they've obviously got a huge base of talent they've got data 20 years of search people telling google what it is that they want and then lastly they have distri distribution they've got multiple products youtube uh chrome uh android all of which they have a billion users daily so they have all the pieces that should enable them to be the leader they just really haven't had the will to sort of go out in the market and really do it open ai has shown that more that was basically the the take in the piece then we came out and we had uh some of the issues with gemini giving uh obviously false historically inaccurate uh information in images and in text responses which has sort of continued and bled over into this week that's prompted now a response from sundar the ceo at google at alphabet um basically just saying you know it it was a mistake it's unacceptable and that they're going to do something about it it felt again as shareholders in our our core titan fund it felt pretty disappointing i would say in terms of a response felt very political uh and i don't know that there was much substance behind it to really get us excited that sunnd is going to push this ai thing in the right direction yeah with the we are holding on there relative to google and also watching coly what how elon's been responding to this he's had i would say a field day over the past week uh mocking what has happened with gemini and talking about the concept of a truth seeking ai it's something that at deep water we believe strongly in just this idea of having ai that really shoots for the center of the fairway and uh ultimately just gets these things right doesn't make the mistakes that gemini is doing and when we think about how this plays out i think x. a is one of those companies that that gets a a large amount of attention amongst private investors and the venture community talks a lot about it but the public community still hasn't i think fully awoke uh term that i'm sure elon would love to the potential of x . a so um we're excited about where x. a ultimately is going to go when you think about what ai companies have the potential to win really big open ai is the most obvious one google for all the reasons we just described should also be in the picture um i think that x. is really the wild card in the space they've got you know more unique data in my opinion than anthropic as a competitor um just through twitter through twitter through x i mean i i think you have the pulse of real time like what is happening in the world you can't really get that anywhere else you know we're seeing uh reddit going public right they're going to ipo soon they just did a $60 million deal to share some of their data with google i'm sure they're going to do other deals with other ai players so that data will become kind of commoditized but the twitter data is is i think really unique and that's what makes x uh and grock their their uh chat interface so interesting because uh not only do they have that unique data but i also think they have this perspective that elon has been very adamant about that he does want it to be a truth seeking ai he's not really interested in playing these sort of you know politically correct games that we're seeing google play certainly with gemini there's been some accusations that open ai sort of does a little bit of the same thing obviously not to the same extent um so if you really want truth if truth is important in this world where we're asking machines questions and we're trusting the answers all the time i think truth is paramount important uh because we're going to think these robots are being honest to us and if they're not for whatever reason that's a bad outcome bad outcome huge opportunity for musk and company on behalf of this week's deep tech 315 that's dog i'm jean bye for now
Pressure Points: Cybertruck Release Event,2023-11-30 23:25:43+00:00,7,w97mjKxjsyU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w97mjKxjsyU,welcome to deep tech 315 our three topics this week are earnings focused that being tesla meta and then we're going to group one topic as google and microsoft so taking us through a big tech earnings week and kicking it off as a reminder feels like a lifetime ago tesla reported but they missed revenue and earnings off of lowered expectations so analysts had been lowering their expectations going into the quarter everybody was and that we jokeing use the term everyone i think in this case everyone was under the table waiting for the ceiling to fall down ceiling fell down but uh stock popped up and it went up based on of course elon mentioned in the shareholder letter that they are going to be moving forward the time of their next generation vehicle uh they had been talking about this starting production in late 25 elan said it could be early 25 or even late 24 i'll take the over on that over under and either way they're pushing forward on this nextg platform it did beg the question of is this the model 2 is this the robo taxi and just some further context is that the uh they they emphasized this concept that they are going to be leveraging their existing production capacity to do this they don't need to build giga mexico and so putting it all together if you would have given me that press release i would said down 10% i think it just speaks to the enthusiasm that the tesla believers have that in fact this will re accelerate revenue growth next year it's paid to be a contrarian i think throughout this earnings period i mean like you said everybody kind of hated tesla going in stock rips i think everybody mostly probably loved meta coming in stock tanks and then we have google we'll talk about more in a minute uh felt like that was more mix coming in stock is doing well um so it's it's one of those interesting uh reminders i think important reminders that the setup matters a lot when you're talking about going into earnings setting aside earnings i think the question is you know what we learn here from tesla that we didn't already know it doesn't feel like we learned a ton right like we already kind of knew elon's talked about robotaxi we have an event he's kind of flagged later this year around that and then this nextg platform he kind of said this report was was not true i'm curious inside the company if they were expecting to see a time like timeline like that laid out so like you said i take the timeline too but yeah he's pushing the pedal like he always does for sure the uh the piece that i guess for for me was uh i agree that the robo taxi the model 2 we don't know didn't get a ton of of detail on that he he did say uh to a question about uh to give some more detail about what this car is all about he said we'll have more details you know what's gonna let me take a step back when you got a question about the robotx in some more detail around that he said you'll have to wait till uh august 8th to hear more about that uh i'm not positioning that as well i need to go back and look at the transcript but basically there was a question that if you read between the lines that he would have suggested that they were in fact going to do the robo taxi i think it's actually going to be the robo taxi that's the i'm out of consensus on that i think they will show robo taxi or this production opportunity late 24 early 25 i think it is related to robo taxi the other piece i would flag that was viewed as a positive was related to delivery growth i was pounding the table that they were going to lower guidance on the deliveries for the june quarter if you went and did the math it looked like they're going to have be down 6% in the june quarter deliveries and uh they said that deliveries for the full year were going to be up and that the june quarter was going to be better and i think what that translates to is that deliver is probably for june are going to be down about 3% and deliveries for the full year up about 1% that does imply a nice steady 152% clip and growth in those those final two quarters sequentially so it's a pretty high bar i still think he should plan 2024 for overall deliveries to be down about 5% i'm going to stand by that prediction that's where they end up understand elin's on a different page i'll give you a final word on tesla it's just in the doghouse i think that's the reality of it even with that 10% move i think there's still a lot of questions we think about like the mag s it feels like tesla is the one that um is a little bit on the outside right now is it still one of the seven is it just the six um and it feels like this august 8th event is important i think they need to show something you know not just another cool demo i think they need to show that they've got a product that can really accelerate revenue re accelerate revenue really um and put them back into that conversation of being one of the best companies in the world because they make the best electric car i there's any question about that but are they as impactful as the googles and the apples and the microsofts i think time will tell love it uh let's shift to meta of course that was the exact opposite reaction uh stock traded down uh call it uh it started out trading down 10% and then zuckerberg opens up the call and says we're going into an multi-year investment phase remind me of amazon commentary then doc stocks down 177% on that kind of rallied throughout the next day ended up let's call it down 10 perish but the overall message was it wasn't enough um they actually guided for revenue for the june quarter to be down to be 1% less than what analysts had expected still up mid 20% year-over-year but down 1% less i think the whisper numbers were they're going to beat them and so or raise for june and so kind of the guide down was 5% 7% and then you have this capex commentary of course where they talked about that being up um about 12% higher than what people thought and i put those two together and thought i think the stock should be down five or 10 perc and then they go through the earnings call and he talks all about ai and i'm thinking i understand the stock's goingon to be down tomorrow but the stock really should be up yeah i think universally at least at deep waterer where we own meta in our flagship titan strategy we own it in our crossover uh public private strategy we're huge believers in the company and i think we all felt uh down 20% aftermarket almost it just felt crazy it felt like a huge over overreach and ultimately i think that turned out to be right today it only ended down i think 10 or 11 perc last i saw so you know i i think that it's one where again go back to expectations i think expectations coming in to your point were maybe a little bit uh more optimistic obviously than what they gave and then i think zuckerberg's commentary on top of that very small mist that we're talking about that kind of lit the fuel on the fire for investors some investors at least to just walk away and say we don't want to play this game again i think that's the wrong take i think that they have proven and are proving uh certainly over the last week or so with this launch of llama 3 which is in my view the most powerful open source model on the market and the integration of llama 3 into meta ai proving that it is that powerful model i think that's a big statement from meta and i think that they are showing and zuckerberg talked about this you know i don't think they're just trying to be the best open source model company in the world or some bit player like they want to be the player in ai and they've got a shot they've got a lot of data just like google they don't have as much distribution but that's kind of a wild card if they really make a game of it yeah they've uh not google not the frequency of distribution that google has but 3.2 billion daily active users they've got they've got it's strong and uh you've talked a lot in the past about agentic ai the the concept of an agent so people call this personalized ai zuckerberg ended the call giving a wonderful explanation of what a gentic ai can be to meta and it it reminded me of like a year and a half two years ago when he got asked the question about why should we be excited about the metaverse and he gave an uh a really uh it was a disappointing answer terrible answer to say it nicely and this time he just nailed it which i think kind of speaks to his conviction about the ai opportunity and uh you've talked a lot about this concept of agent based ai and you just mentioned about the data piece and that's a big deal and i i wonder what's the give and take going to be related to privacy when it comes to consumers do you think once they see the value of these this ai actually getting little things done for you that people will say i don't care about privacy let's give it over to meta and let's let's rock and roll i've always had a little bit of a contrarian view about privacy in the first place which is you know people the way they act matters more than what they say the way people act is they don't care about privacy already and so i would i would argue the premise of that question while a lot of people are going to ask it is actually flawed people already don't care about privacy if you can prove to them that forget about privacy for a minute we're going to give you this service this agentic ai that understands what you want maybe has your credit card information can handle tasks for you and save you time that's just going to be another reason for people to not care about privacy so so yeah i mean i think that is absolutely the future i don't think i'm going to say it and it's going to sound controversial i don't think privacy matters at all in the context of where agentic ai goes i think people are going to be very willing because they've been willing in the past to let big services not just meta but google apple microsoft use your data to deliver these services because i think they will have value for people sounds like we're on the same page met is in a good spot i think that goes higher over the long term and last we'll wrap with kind of the combo punch of google microsoft uh i'll let you kick this one off any initial take google deserves to be up 10 plus perc in the aftermarket it feels good uh in our world because that's the other mega cap name that we are owners of and big owners of so i'm glad we have that to offset meta bottom line for them is that by testing our patients in fairness like i'm glad we've hung in there but it has tested us i think testing a lot of investors patients and and that i think is part of the reason for why the stock is up so much in the aftermarket after this report i mean basically they did the meta report last quarter they had great underlying fundamental business results search was incredible they increased their buyback they issued a dividend which now seems to be the growing trend in silicon valley pay dividends like old companies um but that you know they just showed that for all of the negativity for all the questioning that i think has happened over the past couple of months with google and rightfully so are they moving fast enough is gemini broken it seemed like it was broken at one point um i think that they are kind of getting back in the good graces they're starting to accelerate some of the product releases into the world on the ai side and if they can keep up that momentum i think that that would be a very good thing for the company and then ultimately for the stock i'm in agreement there we'll just quickly hit microsoft all that matters is azure there it i think proved itself out on the guidance piece they have four segments they guided uh two of the segments down 1% for the june quarter versus consensus two down 1% they guided uh the uh one one of the segments up 1% and then azure they just said it's going to grow 30 to 31% it just grew 31% in the march quarter and of uh stocks up 4% and stock really didn't do anything uh throughout the earnings call related to guidance it's rare for microsoft usually kind of jumps around so it just kind of reminded me all roads lead back to azure they're gaining share google up 29 azure's up 31 the piece that i took away from it was there's all this talk about the you know when is the benefit of ai gonna start and i think you just take a big step back is that nvidia amd they're seeing it now because infrastructure is being built we're seen it on the the cloud spend side and that's a form of infrastructure it's just a function of time before the applications come it is my bet and i think we've kind of been consistent about this in deep water is at the earliest i don't think you're going to see anything meaningful for any of these companies before the end of this year and i think more likely it's it's into next year where you see application side revenues that kick in and actually are substantial or meaningful and that you can specifically say you know these are related to some new ai product so investors who think that we're going to get that sooner you know next quarter the quarter after i think they're still on the wrong timeline we are still very much in phase one of what we see in these technological paradigm shifts you build out the infrastructure then you get your data set and ready to go to create great applications and then ultimately you have that application adoption with killer use cases for those end users maybe you know that's the agentic ais that we start to see in a year or two maybe they end up being the ones that really start to spark some of this right on can't wait can't wait for our next episode two on behalf of doug and jean bye for now
DeepTech315: Cybertruck / Musk vs OpenAI / Musk vs Advertisers,2023-12-01 22:34:35+00:00,15,CouJU4D1wQc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CouJU4D1wQc,"welcome to a special episode of deep tech 315 special in the sense that we're going to be focusing on tesla a couple big announcements uh this week one is a formal announcement the other is reporting around potentially a change in their direction and so we'll jump in with what caused the stock to be under pressure earlier in the week related to the deliverers i just want to give a quick setup rewind nine months ago elon was talking about compound growth rate of deliveries of the next decade or seven years at 50% uh in the december 23 quarter they grew deliveries at 20% and the expectations for the march quarter started out at about 10% growth and that declined to plus 2% just before the numbers came out and those numbers came out and it was a meaningful miss to that delivery number it was down 8% now the company uh gave three reasons for the misund deliveries um uh before i get into those i mentioned that well deliveries miss production was essentially in line they produced 12% more vehicles than they delivered that's a unique dynamic usually you don't see that that wide of a spread with tesla production versus deliveries but it's relevant because the three reasons that they gave the first reason was that the switch over from the to the new model three in fremont caused some disruption i find that a little bit hard to connect with the deliver numbers because they still produce more cars than what uh what i would have expected second is the arson fire in giga berlin again that would say that production would have slipped and we didn't see that in the third they talked about complications related to shipping in the red sea which does make sense but when you put all this together doug i g let you go first here about kind of assessing uh the vortex of what's going on and i'll give you ab and a c option here is that we gave their their reasons option a is you agree with their reasons option b how do you feel about the combination of uh high interest rates impacting this competition uh potentially uh you know people holding off for for something or uh what other explon maybe elon's brand is somehow impacting sales in the us so putting all those three those all these forces together what do you attribute the softness to i got take option d which is aam's razor i mean the simplest explanation usually is one that's pretty powerful and i think the simplest explanation is that consumer demand for evs is just weak right now and uh maybe getting weaker maybe this is just a signal that's getting weaker i think you know the interest rate thing to me feels like an excuse every car manufacturer is dealing with the same interest rate environment um and i don't think we're seeing misses you know from them on the uh electric or sorry the gas powered side and so i i think the simplest explanation is probably that and i think that sometimes with this eveve space there there is a little bit more of a religious element to it because there are believers who think the world should be fully electric there are skeptics who say yes you rais his hand there are skeptics that say that you know hey gas is always going to have a place in the world which i think is is probably to some extent true now maybe a very small place um but for me it comes down to a simple thing which is what i've always said i don't think an electric vehicle is 10x better than a gas car is it better yes but when we think about technological paradigm shifts and vertical adoptions usually that happens when you do have a 10x better technology iphone versus palm computers iphones are 10x better and we saw the iphone and the smartphone be adopted like that and i think that that's the one thing that we do have to factor in here i i think evs will probably be the majority of cars but it's going to be this really long slope that may look linear it may be bumpy sometimes if we thought it was going to be the iphone smartphone curve i think that we were wrong and i think we're kind of seeing that right now um from my that all makes sense from my perspective i think that there was more hype than i realize more excitement that i realized a few years ago and that probably pull forward some demand from people maybe compressing the time and the the interval that they' buy a car kind of pulled some demand forward i'm sure that that had an impact on it agree with you largely evs are a little bit more expensive than gas cars but in general that's probably interest rate thing is is probably less of an impact i don't think elon's brand i mean there's people who love them people who don't like them i think that's probably more or less a wash on on that front uh but i do on that the 10x thing it's important part of the conversation because agree that electric cars are not 10x better i don't own an electric car um we're getting our home wired for two electric cars for our next cars and but at the same time i think when you put that combination in that in combination with what can happen around autonomy which kind of leads to the the second part of the conversation here i do think that it can be five six seven eight 10 times better and eventually it's isn't it does it matter if it's 10 times better if it's even if it's three times better and you got to get a new car aren't you getting an electric in in five 10 years i think eventually we'll probably get to a place where maybe it is three times better but i think the reality is it's probably not three times better today i think i think that's just the timing question you know a lot of these adoption cycles do come down to timing do i think an electric car is like i don't know 1. two times better yeah one like we could debate how many times better with once you start putting uh but but but is not dependent on electric though i think that's false equivocation because you could have a gas car that's autonomous it's just sensors yeah i i haven't seen any have i've wondered that why why don't they have gas well i think you have like for example super cruise which is gm's chevy's product right i mean those are on cadillacs that are i believe some of them are gas powered and that's not that's not level five it's not level four it's not the same as fsd but it's a step toward that maybe and just maybe as kind of a segue to our second topic here is that a few weeks ago we have tesla opening up the fsd beta for one month the feedback has been really positive internally andrews tried it he was skeptical he tried it right when it came out a year and a half ago tried it again uh had a lot of good things to say about it so feels like that's moving in the right direction pretty bold bet for tesla to go and throw this out there we talked about it on a previous uh episode here too but that kind of leads into the second topic here which is uh or one i just sorry i'm going to go back and just get some quick uh perspective on the numbers how this all plays out for tesla this year when you start in the hole down 8% like this on deliveries it's really hard to grow for the year if they increase their deliveries by 10% per quarter so absolute numbers increasing 10% sequentially each quarter they got a really tough comp in in june too you're going to end up the year down 2% and so uh this is not a 50% growth the my view when i saw this is that's okay because we're going to get to this cheaper model yes we're going to be down 2% this year and the cheaper model really doesn't come out to 2026 but 2025 people start anticipating that so we start kind of building there's there's another wave that we can look forward to this lower pric vehicle well that got smacked down with a reuter story uh today saying that uh the the company is going to cancel redirect the model two the cheaper $25,000 version and focus on robo taxi and for those who've read the isim biography on musk you'll know that this has been was a big debate do you do a model two do you do a robo taxi and the company had gone out and said that they're going to do the model to and so um from my perspective uh it's they're going after a different market uh here with the robotx it feels like a pretty measurable shift in terms of the direction about where this mass market vehicle can come from it's really big bet i think number one you think about first place at least my head goes is okay if you're choosing between robo taxi and a model two you're talking about two products that have vastly different margin profiles likely a a model two would have been probably fairly low margin product i mean when you get into lowend products like that that's the nature of the game robo taxi if it works obviously that can be very high margin and so you think about the long-term potential of of tesla i know if you're in elon shoes and you say if we think we could accelerate the reality of robo taxi by you know i don't know whatever timeline is it's it's well passed uh several times he's promised that it would be out by now but if you could bring that to market sooner it does seem like it should have more of a long-term positive impact on the ability of the business to do something truly unique and generate cash flow from it than a model 2 would so i don't like i'm usually the tesla skeptic or or the uh rational uh perspective i'd like to say but this feels i think like the right decision to me even though it's a tough one that's by sense too it's a big decision it was a surprise to me but ultimately i had always kind of wondered like why do that lower pric car when if the endgame was for a robo tax you why not just rip the bandaid off i mean that's what they're doing with their electrification is the whole premise of the company is to rip the band-aid off why not do it when it comes to tonomy and then i have this view like in the back of my had maybe they're seeing something good that's happening with some of this preliminary data around fsd because a lot more people are using it now than we're a month and a half ago maybe that's given them some confidence but the reuters was kind of talking about this story uh emerging inside of tesla maybe around the beginning of march which was before this fsd beta that one month free beta uh went to the existing tesla owners and so but i i agree i think it's going to be viewed as yet another reason why tesla is in this difficult period and not seeing clearly what the next couple years for are going to look forward to but ultimately i think it's the right decision to go robo taxi um i think one last thought on the robo taxi just just so we have the balanced opinion on it um the one challenge they will have there obviously i think this is something that people will probably have to talk more about from a stock perspective is how does the government ultimately will regulate this right and it's going to be on a state-by-state level so you're kind of going into many different battlegrounds to try to get these approved we've seen different things happening in california right with cruz um and google's efforts in arizona and um it it will probably be slow we're talking about timing and timelines for things we should um if you are a tesla bull you should expect obviously the government's not going to work fast just because it's tesla um but that might be one of the bigger bottleneck yeah it might be 2028 before 2030 the governments we have willingness to move even if the product is ready so that's that's one variable that think can't the federal government step in and understand it's historically been done by states they said their their the rules of the road for each state but i mean something like this it feels like it's more of a federal question i i think it's going to be state by state yeah the highway highway issues but your message is uh be patient it's not going to be 26 yeah the government never works fast so so yeah hopefully you know hopefully because i think it is you know a valuable product i think it's it is a game changer if if it can happen as much rationality as i think we should look at tesla with that would be a powerful product you know reduce the cost of transportation well more than what uber has done right and using vehicles that are just sitting unused um that would be a really powerful thing maybe reduce the cost of ownership obviously if you have a tesla and a little money on it so i mean there's a lot of really powerful things here that would be completely new um that we don't see in the world right now but again you know the government thing i think is going to be maybe even harder than the technology at this point good call yeah i think that was going to be apple's approach too was just go driverless from the beginning uh i applaud the uh kind of vision of the company to to embrace that i also applaud the vision or the patience of investors to kind of wait which will be years before we likely see anything so but it won't be years before our next deep tech that will be next week on behalf of doug and myself bye for now"
Pressure Points: X.AI Raising $1B,2023-12-05 22:44:40+00:00,5,oCFpOdYAE-4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCFpOdYAE-4,welcome to pressure points our topic is apple earnings and as of the time of this recording which is just after the earnings call ended shares of apple are up about 1% in the after market and a quick recap of the june quarter is that they fractionally beat revenue call it by a percent they beat earnings by call it 4% so it was a solid quarter and the a topic of course the bigger picture here is related to how this next cycle looks like and uh this is an anticipation of the pressure point but i just want to set the table here is that investors of course want to know what the next 12 months look like what are these ai features going to do in terms of upgrade mostly to iphone but also to macs and ipads and so uh the impact of those products is going to be an accelerating revenue growth revenue grew around 5% in the june quarter it's to grow about 5% in september and then it steps up to 6 and 7% and for fiscal 25 it should be up about 7 and2 8% at least that's where the streets at i think it's probably ultimately going to end up closer to be up 9% for fiscal 25 i suspect this will be a strong cycle but that's kind of the investment thesis is just related to trying to get some insight around that and so uh we didn't learn much about that the company was was clear to stay away from giving any expectations about what this next cycle looks like which makes sense so that leaves our pressure point with the guidance and the guidance was call it effectively in line with where the street was at maybe fractionally above where the street is at which at first blush that seems okay good enough but when i thought more about it that guidance comes in the face of what is a stronger than typical osborne effect the osborne effect of course is the dynamic when consumers hear about an exciting new product that's coming they pause purchasing delay purchasing of existing products uh so they can buy the new product and this is something that in my years of covering apple i've heard apple talk about ahead of big cycles is sometimes they'll have some a little bit softer guidance in anticipation or just before a big product comes out and in this case they didn't do that they as i said in line fractionally higher than where the street is at revenue growth rates at basically the same level in september as the just reported june quarter and so i think that that speaks to that apple's products are for many a necessity is that uh they can't have the luxury if your phone breaks to wait until the next phone the next phone comes out and i think it's a sign of the strength of their product line if you dig a little bit deeper into the guidance it's kind of a they give three or four metrics to kind of build it around one of them they gave is expectations about growth in services and effectively they are expecting it to be fractionally above 133% growth they just reported about 14% growth so a little bit of a deceleration there but uh that was higher than where the street was at the street was looking for 10 a half% growth in the september quarter for services and so if you kind of back that piece out it effectively means that the companies probably pulling back a little bit their guidance for the iphone but the big picture is that this is a solid guide in front of what is a solid headwind from the osborne effect and so i think it sets up well for what the next 12 months will look like so that's the pressure point i want to give a little bit of context in terms of how some of these ai features are moving and then talk about capex and so in terms of the timing and roll out of these ai features company didn't mention or reiterated that they're going to be rolling these out over the next year they did give a little bit of detail that most of these are going to be coming to us english initially so it's probably a good sign for at least consumers in europe didn't get a good answer in terms of what's going to happen with china in terms of powering these features i believe that by the fall we're going to see some sort of partnership with byu i think i put a high probability on that to enable these they're still working through kind of that regulatory piece in china but all al together is that they expect the timing of these features to kind of roll out over the next year so we'll kind of have this rolling build of an upgrade cycle it actually bodess well for fiscal 26 as well uh street's looking for revenue to dip a little bit from 75% in fiscal 25 to about 6% as i mentioned i think fisal 25's probably more like 9% growth and i think fisal 26 will be more like 7% growth so uh that's the feature piece and lastly on capex this of course is the a topic for many companies amazon tonight just reported capex 12% higher at at 17.8 billion uh apple's capex drum roll about two billion just over two billion uh it is almost a showstopper when you think about the difference between what amazon google microsoft and meta are spending that's on an annual basis somewhere between 35 and 55 billion up 50% year-over-year versus apple call it 10 billion and basically flattish year-over year they they essentially didn't answer the questions on the call when they're asked about how to think about the dynamic of capex and open ai and and how that's shared but at the end of the day apple's ai investment approach is very different than the rest of big tech they're essentially uh having open ai pick up the bill for this in in google as they open up to gemini next year and so it's uh was i think a brilliant move down the road they knew they couldn't catch that llm train they focused on the small language models and the partnership road and and get people to upgrade and build a services business and a hardware upgrade cycle around it so uh i think this ultimately this capex piece the lower capex piece should allow apple to reach higher margins higher profitability record profitability faster than the rest of big tech sometime uh in the middle to late part of next year and so overall big pitcher is intact we're still in a waiting game to see what the end of september looks like on these initial iphone sales and on behalf of pressure points bye for now
005: Generative AI with Jack Kendall,2023-12-07 23:45:24+00:00,47,UxKBZwOOk4w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxKBZwOOk4w,welcome to pressure points i'm jean monster our topic is apple pulling the series 9 and ultra watch from us shelves and what's the impact to the company and how we think this is going to play out so in terms of some background on the story is a few months ago apple lost a patent case related to the oxygen sensor in apple watch series 9 and ultra and this is from a company masimo it's a us-based company about a $6 billion market cap they're bas in california and have sell basically medical device equipment and have an a blood oxygen sensor as part of it and so apple's in the process of appealing this before the ruling on the appeal apple has proactively decided to remove these from the us shelves only so in terms of the impact to revenue just to put this perspective apple does not break out apple watch as a percentage of revenue we estimate that it's about 5% of revenue and growing at just above 10% i believe that that the series 9 and ultra are the majority of watch sales probably 23s or a little bit more than that the other watch in the lineup is the se and its selling point is the $250 price point and that does not have the blood oxygen monitor on it and so here apple is pulling from the us shelves uh the us business accounts for about uh 35% of apple's overall sales so when you put this all together and assume that this uh these two watches are pulled from the shelves for the next year that'd be a negative 1% hit to revenue so it's measurable it's small it's measurable but ultimately i think it doesn't matter because i suspect in the next couple months that apple will find a way forward there are two ways forward and one is that they win the appeal and the second is that they lose the appeal and then they pay mimo and in this case uh we'll take the more um the more signific ific negative impact if they do lose the case and they lose the appeal and they have to pay it probably would be something that's pretty nominal apple has lost patent cases in the past and we never really even see it impact to margins as i mentioned the revenue impact here is pretty small and any sort of licensing fe would be insignificant and probably not even measurable in the grand scheme of things but it is important for apple to pursue and get these back on the shelves i think they're probably selling again in the us within the next couple months and the reason is that watch is important for apple longer term of course they've got an initiative around health and wellness and they want to do more with the watch in terms of features mark german recently was talking about this year apple coming out with a blood pressure monitoring feature that would be huge it's something in our venture investing that we've seen a lot of companies try to crack the code at some sort of everyday wearable that does blood pressure monitoring it's exceptionally hard to do and if apple can pull it off i think it would really create a lot of utility for watch even though people don't want to know their blood pressure every minute of the day i think it just would provide a lot of utility and so if they're going for aspirations like that they're going to want to keep the oxygen the blood oxygen sensor around and so i think they ultimately find their way through this and this just becomes an afterthought and we get to focus on more exciting things like vision pro coming out early next year i'm behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now
DeepTech315: Gemini / AMD / GTA VI,2023-12-08 19:27:55+00:00,15,C8rjJVb74sc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8rjJVb74sc,welcome to deep tech 315 that's doug clinton i'm jean moner our topics this week are google and gemini separately we're going to talk about an underappreciated ai opportunity with meta and last we're going to give kind of our bigger picture framework of where the market how it evolves related to ai in the next three to five years so back to the top dog there was some new names getting thrown out there google makes announcements related to gemini and the big picture here is they are i think at the the substance of this is that they're offering a subscription for the first time that would be similar to what chat gpt 4 has google is calling that subscription gemini advanced and 20 bucks a month and uh that is what i saw as kind of the big news is finally after waiting six nine months a year for this google is in the game of providing a subscription based their most advanced model that is available for people to use similar to how people use chat gpt for today i'm curious what was your takeway when you saw the news uh i think you look at it two ways you could say the optimistic view which is they've done something new they've put out gemini ultra now 1.0 into the wild and that's good but uh the skeptics view and we are google shareholders in our core titan uh strategy and i'd say we've been become uh let's say more frustrated with google more recently at their pace of innovation and i would say this announcement has not allayed that fear so the skeptic's view would say well yeah open ai with chat gpt did this months ago anthropic with claud did this months ago perplexity the proposed google killer they've had a subscription product out uh now for a little while and so why is it taking google so long to even try this subscription concept um it's a little bit perplexing to me to use a pun on it i think when i've actually used the product so i've subscribed to uh gemini advanced i use the ultra model i've actually used the pro model before outside of bard and my frustrations i think were kind of confirmed in the sense that this is confirmed with advance today even with advanc using the google model their top line model uh gemini ult ra through their chat structure bard which is now called gemini and that's going to be confusing because the chat is called gemini the model is called gemini we have to have some delineation they got to figure that out um it is in many ways i think inferior to chachi pt and even claude at this point and i've been frustrated with claude in the past the problem that i have is that for some reason the chat structure that google puts around its model it just nerfs the model to use a gaming term it makes the model way less powerful than it really is and i'll give you a specific example um i use ai as a power user i would say in many ways to pick stocks to try to beat markets i've been doing it for six months with intelligent alpha we've talked about that before so i'm very experienced with all these models and even more in the open uh open source side as well the thing that is annoying to me is when you use gemini as a model outside of bar outside of what's now gemini the chat structure from google it's actually very capable it's easy to use it will listen to the request that i make of it with almost no issue when i give the same exact requests to the chat interface through google's tool it almost always gets rejected it'll tell me that i can't complete the request it doesn't tell me why or it will say uh i can't read the data set that you've given me even though i would give it the exact same data set in a different tool or through a different interface and it'll work so let me let me interrupt there the underlining model is basically the same model that's providing the insights but there's a chat uh layer on top of it that you're getting nerfed out on yeah and for some reason what it seems based on my use cases and and my experience with it is that the chat layer that google is putting on top of its model is uh restricting what you can do with the service and i think that that is uh it's indicative just just of the problem google has had with ai like they're not willing to just let it fly i will give the same exact request the same exact data to chat gpt to claude to other models llama 2 which we're going to talk about in a moment no objections no problems nothing and then when i do it through the b now gemini interface problems galore if i go outside that interface i use the same model i use gemini no problem that's bizarre to me do that infuriating i could see them metering it both on direct to the model or through the chat interface i could see that but having that inconsistency doesn't make any sense to me and i think it it speaks to what has been our issue wall street's issue is how aggressively they're they're going after all of this and so they're just afraid to let it fly i mean let it go let it let it let it do what open ai is doing with gpt let it do what mostly anthropic i think is a little too conservative too in my opinion but they're they're getting better with claude over the last couple weeks at least well they i think they got a good they're at a fork and a road here they can continue down this this path of of metering things and fall behind and have a difficult time catching up or they can actually get in gear and the part that's maddening for us as an investment team around this is this concept that they've got incredible data they've got search data since 199 98 now granted there wasn't a ton of searches being done in 1998 but they have search data from back there 25 plus years of search data they got distribution it's probably better than any company's distribution their products touch probably every internet user uh globally daily i mean it's incredible the two assets that they have and then when it comes to having the drive and determination to innovate around something they've been talking about since n since 2017 being an ai first company and we can continue to see them jump off or not even jump off sides get to the get to the line of scrimmage you're afraid to even go off sides that's the problem yeah afid to even go outside so um that's that's it as it stands today um we're frustrated more to come there we're going to shift to our second topic which uh we're doing a a webinar this week doug and and you're you're talking about uh meta and the opportunity i'm going to set up kind of the first part where i think most of wall street is at when they think about meta and ai and then i want you to talk about this the second piece and the first piece is people look at meta as having an opportunity to use ai what they're using it today which is to help advertisers build campaigns build attribution and then also increase engagement whether it's through emu the image generator from instagram or through their chat celebrity bots better uh targeting all that and that has a positive impact on engagement and revenue growth and that's a clear example of how meta can benefit from ai so that in itself is good it's real it has substance it's what has powered the stock uh in part uh more recently but you said something that really caught my attention around llama llama i think is underappreciated as an asset with meta i know some people are paying attention and then obviously on the last earnings call just a couple weeks ago mark zuckerberg he did highlight you know some of the ideas around how they ultimately benefit from it because i think people have been asking the question how do you benefit from an open source model that is you know i'm going to use air quotes free it's mostly free there are some caveats to that they actually make a little bit of money from it through partnerships with aws and through uh microsoft with azure but the thing that i think is more important you know zuckerberg outlined that he thinks llama to being the leading open source model in the world it helps them improve their models right because they're getting data they're seeing how other people are using the model for different use cases and also it helps them attract talent but there's a third piece that i think is even bigger and it goes to zuckerberg's philosophy and he's always talked about his view of business as building a product on the internet that a billion people want to use leave it open then once you have a billion users then start thinking about monetization that's the kind of scale he's thinking about and i think the same thing will hold true with llama ultimately you're going to have thousands maybe even millions of developers it's been downloaded 30 million plus times i think just over the past couple of months you're going to have those developers building products that billions of people will use and i think ultimately meta will find a way to directly monetize llama over time that might be some sort of a managed service that might be providing data uh sort of uh access cloud data services i don't know what it'll be but it feels like 's more there um and i don't think we're going to see anything meaningful on that front maybe over the next year or two i think they're focused on just winning that billion user customer base but you zoom out a little bit further and i think there's a lot of optionality that is perhaps underappreciated still for the company you took the word right out of my mouth optionality we love having it as investors in meta we're going to wrap with the final topic which is just you know where are we at in terms of the market and appreciating ai or maybe already being in a bubble and we've talked a lot about this in the past but i just want to back up to fall of last year there was talk we're at a peak ai bubble since then if you look at the nasdaq it's up 15% microsoft's up 27% amd meta up 50% nvidia up 57% and arm yes arm up 88% up 58% on a surge on their december earnings and of course you see this you look back over the last 6 months so people said we're at a bubble six months ago they're going to say we're at even more of a bubble today we're even that much closer to this bubble busting i think they're probably going to end up being wrong uh over the medium term i'll say so over the next couple of years i think we're going to continue to see more investment flow into ai and ai related companies i think you do have to at least look though i mean since the beginning of the year it has been insane i think is a fair thing to say just how much the mostly large cap mega cap the biggest companies in the world stocks have moved i mean meta up 30 plus per inid i think is up 40% this is just year to date you went back further than me i'm just talking about in the last month and a week um so these moves are pretty fantastic i think at some point the market has to take a break i mean even in bull markets and bubbles there are breaks in the action and so i wouldn't be surprised it feels like we're due for one but you can be due for a really long time so i'm not making any sort of you know strong call it's just something as people pay attention to it as we pay attention to it i think that's something to at least be aware of but again these companies nvidia in particular i think is a good use case or a good example a lot of the movement in the stock has been because they've been selling a lot more product it's not just multiple expansion that we're seeing with these companies it's that we're seeing revenues inflect some of them are inflecting for reasons other than ai i don't think meta is having a hug huge benefit from ai related revenues right now but their business is performing really well and that's really true across a lot of the mega cap names so you know it's it's it's felt crazy and i think it's going to feel crazy from time to time over the next few years um but in our view you know we're still early on in this investment cycle we need the bubble to guarantee that ai will break out i still think we're going to get it and i still think uh we've got a few years to really get to that peak i can say in the last three months i've got spring in my step i think we're in that 1996 1997 range and this is kind of a once in every 30 years type of an opportunity in front of us here and so uh we'll leave it there on behalf of doug jean and deep tech 315 bye for now
Pressure Points: November CPI,2023-12-12 14:26:47+00:00,4,MBWy6Y6G5Rg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBWy6Y6G5Rg,welcome to pressure points our topic is takeaways from apple's march quarter results as of the time of this recording which is about an hour after the earnings call ended the stock is up just over 6% at the beginning of the call was up about 7% so call it hang it hung in there the reason why i think the stock jumped on the earnings was less about the march quarter it was basically in line more about the june guidance which was in line also with the street up a percent and a half revenue year-over-year but the whisper numbers the expectations were that they were going to guide down by a few perc and so there is a relief that june is actually better than expected the business is holding together better than expected as it kind of comes to the trough of the iphone 15 cycle separately they increase the buyback by more than people were expecting uh they took it from 90 billion to 110 billion most people were expecting them to kind of reiterate that 90 billion number they do that once a year when they report their march quarter and so combination of those two i'd put 80% of the move related to the june guidance and and 20% related to the buyback so that's all the near term but that is not those are not the key takeaways here there's a lot more meat uh than just the june guidance and i'll go through five uh key takeaways the first is related to ai and they came out swinging when it comes to ai remarkable how this company has not wanting to mention the topic because they probably felt it was hype to now saying in cook's words that this will impact most of their products generative ai will not just ai making the products better but generative ai and i think that that speaks to the potential around generative ai and apple coming to that realization so of course we're going to get more of that in june more of the details and they did stop short of any of the details about what these products are cook did mention that their ai strategy is going to capitalize on their hardware software services approach which makes sense he's going to bring that up but he added the privacy piece to it and this is something that all along i've believed is a major competitive advantage for apple when it comes to ai is people trust apple and i think when you get into what is referred to as personalized or agent or agentic ai where you ask the machine to do something for you and then it goes out and grabs some of your personal data and actually performs multiple tasks on its own in that world the concept of privacy becomes really important and it seems like it makes sense that apple's going to u make sure that consumers know that i do believe that it's going to take a year two three years to get to that agentic ai i think that we're going to start to see some of uh ai generative ai in apple's products as early as this fall fall with updates to the operating system and maybe even around the next iphone 16 and them kind of playing up the silicon side of what they're doing as benefit to ai so things moving forward not a ton of details but apple's in a unique place through to their privacy approach when it comes to ai second topic is capex and if you heard my preview you know this was my main pressure point is what's going on with capex uh it my fear was that we were going to see something that happened with meta where they talk about spending more to build the infrastructure for ai and that would spook margins and uh in fact uh that did not happen margins the guidance for margins in june are essentially in line with what they just reported at record highs and the call the question did come up early in the call about how to think about capex and cfo's luca's response was that they approach their cap x in a unique way he said we do the same thing with our suppliers uh we do some of the capex ourselves and some of it through suppliers and when it comes to data centers he said we build some of our own data centers ourselves and we do some of them through third parties and we'll continue to do that that was his response my initial read on that was there's no gotcha moment that you know if there was going to be some big boost and jump and capex we' heard about about it then and he's talking about this kind of two-layered approach where they can do some of themselves and kind of offload some to third parties and as i've reflected on that comment i believe that really luca didn't tell us much about what to expect in capex all he did is to say we have a a two avenue approach to it and i think ultimately you can still increase capex by a lot working through third parties and so i uh kind of i'm uh amending my my previous optimism around that comment and leaving it at uh they are seem to be navigating this in a a very different way not spending eight8 10 billion dollars a quarter like the other mega caps are my guess is they're probably spending a couple billion and just given their raw size we just don't see it and so i am not expecting a gotcha moment but for the record i don't think he really told us much when it comes to catback with his response the next is related to guidance i covered it a little bit but it is worth uh mentioning the key takeaway there beyond just the guidance is that the business is holding together services are going to continue to grow probably around 14% year-over year the street was looking for 11% and it grew at 14% it's going to be in that kind of range they did say in the back half of the year that comps start to get tougher and we'll start to see some of the growth and services decline but overall the the business held together and is holding together the fears that i and others had about what was going to happen in china didn't play out china was down 8% year-over-year versus down 13 in the previous quarter so i think that uh just the the the system that they have europe for example is uh in the eu that impacts services and it's not impacting it now and so some of those changes that they've had relative to regulation doesn't appear to be having an impact and so the guidance the key takeaway there is that it's just the business is holding together next talk a little bit more about china that came up i feel like it was every third question on the call had something to do with china got a little bit old but the bottom line is they said all the right stuff that they're committed to china see it as a big opportunity but collectively they're seeing all these other regions whether it's indonesia india china saudi mexico brazil collect l those regions are becoming in luca's words big there's a question does it meet what the 70 billion that they're doing in china every year and he wouldn't give any sort of context to how close that was but in general china's still a really important part of this equation for apple even though cook has made a lot of effort in the past few months look at his trips over there to try to diversify not only the demand equation but the manufacturing side one other piece on the china diversification those all those other countries i just listed off apple does have smaller market share on those so luca believes they can continue to grow at higher rates there just because they're coming off a relatively uh small market shares and uh last talk a little bit about department of justice uh not much was said cook reiterated that apple hasn't done anything wrong kind of held the company line my sense is we're not going to hear anything for a long time like this could be late or beginning of 2026 before it even goes to trial and so i think you all uh put all things uh together here and all things consistent uh the stock and after hours as i mentioned up 6% i think it if it wer weren't for the doj we would have a stock that would be above 200 because this is an overhang and investors are going to want to see some sort of resolution and so even though it didn't play a big role on the call i just want to remind people we're probably going to have to wait a little bit here 6 12 18 months before we get any resolution i feel confident that apple's going to uh end in a really good place and at a higher place after all this is said and done more to come on that uh later but that is the five those are the five takeaways from this earnings on behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now
DeepTech315: Autopilot / Adobe / Intel,2023-12-15 14:56:28+00:00,16,gk70-JwMXI8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk70-JwMXI8,"welcome to pressure points our topic is post earnings for tesla three key topics first timing of this next generation vehicle second what sales are going to look like in 2024 we'll talk about fsd those are the three most important then we'll do a quick tour through the toy department on some other topics that came up but we'll jump to the pressure point that we highlighted which was unique this quarter typically it's around auto gross margins x credits this quarter we talked about any sort of common ar about what the demand environment looks like in 2024 and i had predicted that the street was right around plus 5% and those numbers would come to down around 5% and in the shareholder letter the company outlined the exact same language that they had which said to expect meaningfully lower notably lower growth rates in 24 versus 23 and then on the call uh the question came up and elon commented that 2024 should be up this is in terms of sales but sales given what's going on with asp has been relatively steady is going to generally mirror deliveries should mirror sales is the expectation elon mentioned was for that to be up in 2024 over 23 which is a big surprise to me uh later in the call someone asked a follow-up question to that and elon's comment was uh this june quarter should be quote a lot better and so i'm going to put all that that into the stew here look at what the comps were last year and talk about what ultimately i think that this means for deliveries for 20124 and uh again going in the street was generally looking for about 5% growth in deliveries i think that's going to come down to probably 1% growth i mean they're saying it's going to be up and then i was just back testing the model to see how hard is it to get for deliveries to be up 1% when you start out the year the march quarter was down 9% it's just a big hole to dig out of and the answer is that it's going to be a heavy lift to get the june quarter to be a lot better than march he didn't say it's going to be up he just said it was going to be a lot better and june is cing off a wicked 83% comp a year ago so based on my modeling i've got them down about 4% in june so i does i do think that checks the a lot better uh card and going to around 8 % year-over-year for the back half of the year and you kind of put all that together and you're up 1% i think the probability of this is less likely uh a stretch but still doable and so overall it was not as bad as what i had been expecting because i was pretty confident that they were going to be talking about 2024 being down over 23 so we'll see how the year plays out i still think it's good for investors just to think of this year as a throwaway when it comes to delivery and sales i would just do a quick aside in terms of profitability it did come in uh slightly better on a margin basis the auto gross margins x credits it was 16.4% the street before they had printed was looking for 16.2 that was down from 17.2% in december so we saw some stabilization there despite the week delivery numbers which is a sign that let's just kind of throw 2024 out the door the business will survive they got 20 eight billion in cash and they'll be able to get to uh the second takeaway here which is timing of the next generation vehicle and the actual numbers of course we haven't even talked about them yet but for the quarter they slightly missed revenue slightly missed earnings uh the stock traded up 5% kind of immediately on this comment that they are expecting a pull forward in terms of the timing of this next generation vehicle and they previously had stated 3 months ago that that vehicle would be out late in 20 25 and so now they're moving that forward and the assumption before the earnings call was that investors were thinking that probably means mid 25 and elon gets on the call and says he think it it it is going to be early 2025 if not late 2024 and of course all the lights are flashing be aware this is neon forecast comment usually he's wrong on timing but either way just the fact that they are continuing to pursue this given the recent media report reports about some transition some cancelling of some products products like it model 2 potentially shifting to robo taxi whatever it may be uh just there was a relief in the stock as the company was essentially saying to investors don't worry we're going to get to the other side of this and revenue growth will return in 2025 they filled in some of the blanks and said that they're going to be able to do this with their existing manufacturing line so they don't need to build giga mexico to come out with this lower price car but they stopped short of giving being very specific about would this be model 2 they're talking about in late 24 early 25 or is this the robo taxi and i've gone back and looked at the all the commentary on the call about this topic and you can look at it either way it's they suggesting model 2 suggesting robotack my bet is that it is robo taxi and i'm going to read a question that uh got me to that point is this is kind of halfway through the call uh there's a question and uh it was uh can we get an official announcement of the timeline for the $25,000 vehicle and elon's response was well we will talk more about this on august 8th so but really the way to think about tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and a being able to run being able to turn on that autonomy for a giga gigantic fleet uh he also concluded the call by talking about the importance of fsd is you really cannot understand tesla's business unless you get fsd so there seems to be this urgency around fsd and robo tax he kind of plays into that so i'm going to put the weight into that i think they're they're going to say on august 8 that they want to have a robo taxi out in the beginning of 2025 the fact that they get a robo taxi out doesn't that they're going to sell that many of them think back to what happened with the semi and they got it out but then they take a long time to actually start to ramp it up or what's going on with cybertruck and so they can check this box of having an event on august 8th getting a robo taxi out the beginning of next year and then potentially they start running into some headwinds related to lawmakers allowing these robo taxis on the road they did mention that they are making progress there's a couple states that are making progress and they felt that there was going to be this domino effect but either way i think that that's what they're talking about is robo taxi uh early next year that was the second point um uh just i guess related to uh fsd that gets us to the third point i mentioned elon is all in on fsd the total number of miles cumulative miles driven by fsd saw a reacceleration after the 12.3 beta came out and so put this into perspective is when these transitions happen just think about what's happened with gpt for example and the uses there you get accelerating numbers off of higher numbers and that's when you know there's a paradigm shift going on in the case of cumulative miles driven on fsd it actually had the growth rates had decelerated it went from 73% this is quarter on quarter 73% quarter on quarter in the september quarter to 56% in the december quarter and and then if you look at the chart that they gave on their shareholder letter it basically implies that we've seen a re acceleration to 64% growth in the march quarter and they specifically said uh he specifically said on the call 300 billion miles with a b driven i think that that was uh a slip of the tongue there's no way it could have been that but 300 million miles driven by 12.3 that gets you to a 64% growth in fully cumulative a tonomous miles driven which is a re acceleration from where it was 3 months ago and impressive and again this is the company is changing kind of the language to investors and basically saying related to fsd is that if you want to invest in this company you have to believe in our fsd autonomy strategy and that strategy effectively is to sell the hardware for a low margin and then make it up with a higher margin one other uh caveat or whenever postcript related to fsd is they did talk about they're in conversations with one automaker i think they've said that in the past one automaker related to licensing fsd they said by the end of the year they think they will have one if not two automakers licensing this to me that just makes sense because all the other car makers are slowing down they did mention that it's going to be a few years two to three years before any sort of licensed oem actually sees a car come to market because they still have a lot of work that oems do on the hardware to enable fsd and so that is uh the fsd piece still um on a dead center of the company's road map so those are the three most important pieces i would just kind of do a quick tour through the toy department optimist he reiterated that they're that they're doing uh be will soon be doing limited kind of work in the factory and that they potentially could start selling one he reiterated that this could be the biggest value unlock for the entire company i would say uh let's just hold off on i'm getting too excited there i want to leave that still on the table for optionality value because it is tesla and they could crack that code separately they talked about the ride hailing uh fleet and mentioned that it's going to be like a mix between airbnb and uh uber or airbnb and like an own fleet and so sounds like tesla is going to actually own some of the cars themselves and then separately a consumer can own the car or a small group can own a group of cars and put those into the fleet and my takeaway is that uh this is more confirmation that tesla wants to actually own part of the fleet they can have call it a three-year payback on some of those vehicles and the margins just start to really skyrocket in the the later part of the years again all dependent can they crack their code but if they can that this could be a significant unlock in terms of uh value uh other and the toy department is they talked about this aws opportunity essentially as they go into hardware 4 that mo the hardware is so powerful that you can when you're not using car your car essentially lease it back to the an aws type of hosted model that allows them to do ai inference training and this would be the biggest supercomputer kind of a thing um sounds great uh i would not put i put it in the toy department for uh for for good reason and so uh that was my general sense is that at the end of the day this is an ugly quarter for march just kind of bringing it all together here march was an ugly quarter the outlook was more optimistic than i i for sure thought we'll see if they can get there but either way they are optimistic about kind of hitting this next growth curve and for the bull bear debate nothing's going to change i think the people who are skeptical are going to say this is just a melting ice cream cone and we saw it the march results and the people that are positive are going to say they're making uh some something great that ultimately is going to see an inflection point coming up whether it's 2025 or 2026 i continue to be a shareholder and we'll wrap our pressure points uh bye for now"
Pressure Points: Apple's AI Initiatives,2023-12-15 19:46:57+00:00,8,tXSjKICPSU8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXSjKICPSU8,i'm bill clinton co-founder and partner at deepwater asset management and this is the deload podcast we interview ceos founders and builders of frontier technology companies to educate you about where the world is going today i'm joined by victoria weller the chief of staff at 11 labs 11 labs is an ai voice technology company and they will create an ai version of your own voice if you give them a sample you can check it out at elevenlabs.io on the podcast victoria and i talk about why voice is such a compelling opportunity for ai how ai voices will be used in application and of course the prospect of deep fakes now here is victoria weller all right victoria thank you for speaking with me today i'm excited to share more about 11 labs with the audience and it's something i'm really a product that i am getting a voice made from which we'll talk about a little more in a minute but first just so everybody kind of understands what you're building at 11 labs can you give us the pitch yes for sure and thank you for having me uh on the pod doug i appreciate the opportunity as for 11 labs we are building a text to speech platform it's an ai that's in the audio space and essentially what it does is that you can input a written text and it will output this text in audio form so uh read out loud to to you in a way that is almost indistinguishable from a human voice and the way that this works is that the model is contextually aware of the input and thereby knows exactly how to intonate the sentence and pronounce the different words in a way that it is human-like yeah it's for anybody who has not uh tried 11 labs yet which i imagine because you're so new a lot of people haven't experimented with yet they should absolutely go and do it right now it's in my opinion the best uh ai generated voice that i've heard and i've followed this space for a long time like i've wanted this product to exist for a long time my wife and i actually had a podcast several years ago where we would like read really good articles we found online where there wasn't an audio version because if you put it through one of the older ai bots like it just sounded terrible there's just something about that human voice um and so the question i want to ask you about that is you know how how do you how have you solved the problem basically of we've had these kind of bad ai voices in the past what is maybe some of the the things that you've discovered in experimenting with them and maybe fixed to get these really i mean lifelike voices that you have yeah firstly completely agree with you and and your your wife's taking terms of the more robotic sounding and and um older text-to-speech versions are not enticing uh to to listen to so i think with like the human sounding ones there's a big unlock in terms of applications as well and as to your questions of how this this could be unlocked i think 11 labs was founded at the perfect time with the ai um space taking off and that is the key uh um ingredient in terms of making the huge progression from the more robotic sounding voices and and speeches to this human-like iteration because with the large language models there is this ability to understand the context of what is being written and with this understanding it is not a matter of stitching together sounds of pre-recorded words for example is one of the ways that this was done previously but a way to project and predict what the sound would be like from a human based on learning from from previous iterations of the text tied to uh to speech in mentioning text i'm curious to like as as i've thought about the different um buckets of ai right now we have obviously text with with the chat bots uh we're starting to see some stuff in video that's really cool and then you're doing some really interesting stuff with audio what do you think i guess is unique about audio as it relates to the things that people are experimenting with in text versus video yeah um i think there's a huge accessibility factor in in audio that is not necessarily given by text and video in the same way um that is both for just consumption of content there's more like on every um commute people want to consume content in an audio way so be it the news like i'm a lazy news reader but i love listening to news podcasts for example um so creating the the avenue to consume with audio i think is something that is is huge for that specific pillar of ai and that's that accessibility angle applies to people with disabilities as well we've seen a huge adoption of the level lab software within the blind community and that is something that we're fostering a lot as well and want to make sure that they get access to 11 labs um and are able to leverage that platform for to make their quality of life a little bit better using it as a reader um you can imagine if uh how the the sound of like listening to articles being read in the robotic fashion but if you're dependent on that and hear that all day um what a difference it makes to have a human sounding voice as a reader to the visually impaired um so that is one area of accessibility but this applies also to other forms of disabilities we've seen users with als that are using this or people that have trouble speaking that are able to have a voice again um so i think that accessibility factor is something that is unique about voice such an incredible use case it's like a great example i think of how when you think about ai you know you go to certain problems like just translating articles of text but the people who actually benefit from them immensely you know you may not immediately think of some of those audiences but i mean that's that's kind of incredible i think it speaks the power of just creativity with ai and and what could happen down the road yeah it's one of the use cases that it's one of the use cases that i'm also i was very excited uh to see because it's so so touching and so human and somewhat detached from the more capitalistic approach of like where which industries are paying um and would pay for text-to-speech but actually making a difference to human human lives is something i find very inspiring i'm curious if we go down that road a little bit more um we've talked before on on this podcast about things like personal ais and ais that really get i think integrated like more into our lives and they might know you know our travel schedules and our credit card numbers and our favorite foods and all these things and you mentioned you know something interesting just about having these interfaces for um some of the accessibility aspects of it how do you think about maybe the integration of voice more broadly as an ai product with some of this personalization like where do you see that going yeah i agree that um personal assistance is something that is uh taking up a lot more and and moving from more the industrial use cases to the domestic ones as well everyone is turning their home into a smart home um and there's a huge development in creating assistance that are humanoids as well and i think in those cases it will be the the um voice aspect is going to be a critical characteristic as well so looking forward to seeing integrations with that but i do think that um in that development the voice aspect is a is a key characteristic um i see that also for the humanoid use case at home where you want to create an assistant that is somewhat part of your routine um and part of your your home and um especially if you want to have a companionship for example as one of the desired outcomes of of these assistants in that case the voice is is huge if you think of the movie her the voice is kind of the only avenue to that companionship that is is created there or i've been thinking recently about the movie castaway where he has a companionship in the ball and what a huge difference it would have made if there was also a voice attached to that so giving humans value um with these technological advancement advancements i think will be huge for for voice to be a key part of that but i do think that voice is like the communication aspect effect and one layer of the entire technology and there are a lot of other layers that have to be developed and have to work as well for those personal assistants and personal ais to to be fully functioning there's a layer of like interpreting perception reasoning decision making and all of that has to come together first and then on top of that we will have the communication layer that is just for the interaction with with humans yeah her is the first place i went when i heard your voices for the first time i mean it's literally you know what what you guys are doing it's just it's so lifelike um i'm curious too like if you think about you know that as maybe a longer term opportunity that we have these sort of companions really that are working with us kind of our personal eyes if you if we rewind maybe a little bit more toward the present like the next one to three years what do you see as the biggest opportunities there because it feels like her is maybe a little bit further away but there's other applications that that feel like you know you you could see this deployed more more uh currently yeah agree that her is a little bit further away but i've seen use cases already where um uh companions or ai companions are made and huge uh the voice is a huge component of that as well also it will take a while for any ai to have an amazing voice like scarlett johansson and unless she licenses her voice uh for that um but in the more immediate term um for what we've seen i think the huge adoptions so far have been mostly in the content creator and the education space which i've been told that this is hard to penetrate um i haven't been working on a product before that needed to be adopted by this community but i think that in this case of 11 labs we could leverage the fact that the product is so strong that the adoption in this content creator space was almost a self-starter as soon as people started using this for voiceovers are similar for the youtube channels their instagram posts their tick tock um videos it was uh immediately evident like what the what the value is provided there and so we've seen the the largest uptake in in that um another industry that i've been more surprised about the uptick in or the the potential of is the gaming industry i think that's mostly because of my personal preference i'm not a huge gamer so i was largely oblivious to what is going on in that space but it is a very progressive and agile in the sense that it is open to using new technology but also a huge field and and already a lot happening in like the virtual and ai-centric world so including voice ai in there is a huge opportunity and something that we've seen a lot of um uptake in and probably more happening there over the next couple of years especially as games and um such become hyper personalized that you can choose your own experience and go down different routes in the game and with each route you will will be able to create the voices on the go so that you can have a tailored experience that doesn't require pre-recorded and and pre-formed paths but you can go a whole a slew of ways and then everything is created on the go with text-to-speech software um i think there's also huge potential in the publication and and media space we've seen a lot of that as well there's a bit slower adoption i would say in in entertainment and advertising also huge spaces but they have their own reasons for adopting a little bit more slowly and then i think as we move beyond like one or two years more complex use cases such as call centers are going to be a little bit harder to tackle because there's a lot going on underneath the texas beach surface as well similar to the personal ai it's that in the call centers you have to have the decision making and the information gathering and the understanding and responding working and then having the communication layer on top of that and then there's a speak component to that as well if you want to do it in real time you have to be very quick at all of those steps so i think the more complex use cases but then also the the smaller markets or the ones where voice isn't really important like it's used but it's not key um might be a little bit more slowly as well just because it's not at the center and not a priority something like announcing the stops on on a bus like in the traveling industry in a transport industry and i think those would be a little bit slower to adopt as well you're thinking about entertainment and you mentioned like the example of scarlett johansson uh licensing her voice one thing i know your product does that i think is really unique is you can submit your own audio files and have an ai version of your own voice created um so i did that i actually submitted some files and so i'm in the queue i know you have a kind of a backlog i think that you're working through yeah i'm curious like um what what does that process look like you know like kind of what is going on behind the scenes once you have a user's you know voice files to ultimately deliver to them their own ai voice yeah so we have um two different ways to to clone voices and if if you're getting tired of waiting for your professional voice clone in the queue there's also an instant version so um the there's probably four ways there's four ways on 11 labs to access voices you can generate a voice that doesn't exist you select some parameters and you hit generate and you will have a unique voice that doesn't exist and that hasn't existed before you could go to the voice library where users from the community have created such voices and shared them amongst the community and you can leverage those created voices in the voice library you can do an instant clone of your own voice for that you only need 30 seconds of audio and you get a good result in terms of mimicking the way that you pronounce words and and your voice sounds as a as a result to use on any text thereafter and then there's a professional voice clothing you need more audio for that as an input you need 30 minutes and as you mentioned there's a backlog and a queue in the cpus required for that are larger because the training of the model is more intricate and that will create a higher quality clone of your voice amazing and i know you mentioned the models a few times but are you using your own proprietary models in your in your software are you using third-party models for this everything's about in-house in-house foreign we have a set of amazing engineers so the cto and co-founder he had been working on this for a while and created the first version of the model um over a year ago now when when matthew and piagra started 11 labs and so since then have been iterating with a growing number of engineers the big focus of 11 labs is also to keep researching and keep iterating on those models to always stay ahead and always be the best text-to-speech version um software that exists as well as creating that product to make it accessible for the public and part of that you mentioned the voice library i'm i'm wondering as you think about the library you know in some ways you're kind of making voices like an asset class like if you have a voice that people want to license um you can you can monetize that um so is that is that kind of how you see part of the vision is is making people's you know voices sort of this asset class or this licensable thing or do you see it more as just you know hey we're trying to create as many unique voices as possible and it's really more about the the variety of voices whether it's you know generated by a computer or if it's it's from a human source i think the variety of voices is definitely a huge factor we want to be able to cater to all needs and all use cases that someone who's making a meditation video has the perfect matching voice for that accessible right there but that doesn't have to be limited to a computer-generated voices or ai generated voices that can be expanded to human voices as well and offering cloned voices of yourself in in the voice library is definitely not out of the question how do you think about i mean i have to ask the you know the deep fake question because i'm sure people are probably thinking about it but but how do you address that potential issue where i mean of course this is going to happen it's just human nature people are going to do things that that are unethical sometimes with ai how do you address the deep fake concern yeah definitely a valid concern and and definitely something that we take really serious serious at 11 labs we're trying to lean into this as much as possible to learn quickly and collaborate with people in the industry in governing bodies and regulators and others that are developing ai and work alongside them and with them or even listen to the community to hear what they they would like um to set up there and are continuously iterating on the guard rails that we can set up to ensure that the deep fakes are one not produced or sought after and identified as quickly as possible um the forms that this takes is for example the instant voice cloning or any kind of voice cloning on 11 labs is behind a paywall so you need to be identified and enter your credit card details before getting access to that we've also been exploring ways to monitor and flag when the terms of terms of service have been broken and effectively banned those that that use our platform in in the wrong ways or in compliant ways um definitely uh cognizant of the fact that this is still a nascent space and we will have to trial new ways of doing this um in in the best possible way but it's something that we're we're committed to um very strongly at 11 labs i think the fact that or the reason why deep fakes are currently at very dangerous is because they're it's still so new um i think we haven't learned or the general public hasn't learned to um confront any piece of content with the default assumption or the question of like this could potentially not be real like first i need to understand whether this was maybe generated was what i'm seeing generated was what i'm hearing generated and assess the possibility of that by default um and to make that a reality i think education is a huge piece to provide materials to educate on this and to cover it um is is a big one here but that is not something that is only up to um a startup or maybe the like the the softest version of defense that we can put up we want to integrate this into the product as well and and equip like real tools rather than just saying okay the end user or the consumer should know and assess this and make a decision we also want to put out the the tools and the guard rails for this um and one thing that we've done i'll put out recently in this realm is the ai speech classifier that's a tool available um publicly as well where you can upload a piece of audio and it will assess whether this was created with 11 labs so that if you come across a piece of content and you want to know um could this potentially be fake you can check whether it was created with 11 labs but the to to to bridge the um to the positive again what we've actually been seeing that is that the nefarious use cases get an outraged uh outsized coverage and that's how it should be definitely we need to cover this and address it and uh create awareness of the nefarious use cases but on the ground when you look at the usage of 11 labs 99 and the overwhelming majority is is positive use cases so that's very rewarding to see that as mostly um the the good that it's being used for yeah humans are mostly good most of the time that's i think that's the good news we always kind of forget it seems like the you think the solution to this deep fake problem maybe maybe broadly for the industry is some sort of collaboration between the software makers like yourselves probably the platforms where this stuff is getting distributed and then it almost like a a public education or a societal change where people are just maybe not default skeptical about what they're seeing but just default aware that there is technology out there that that might mislead us yeah i think those are three core components i think the first one there of the creators of ai is a huge one because we're at the forefront of this and closest to the understanding of it i think every company in the ai space at the moment has the moral obligation to think about what does this mean and how can i put out the appropriate guard rails for rolling this out um effectively and safely it makes a ton of sense uh so my last question this this podcast is geared toward you know people who are just trying to understand ai and really i think investors enthusiasts people trying to get ahead um and as someone who's building in the space what advice would you give for people who are sort of curious about ai and trying to get ahead and understand just what's going on here yeah i would always uh uh try it out that's how i like to learn personally is like getting my my hands on it so going to a 11labs.io already on the landing page you have the opportunity to do a text-to-speech calls without having to create a set up an account or register in any any way and in there you can pick different voices as well to have to try out the text-to-speech and then once you subscribe and sign up you have the option to clone your own voice which i think is also a really really fun way to learn the other thing except for just like trying it that i found helpful is um consumption of news be it in in podcast format or um briefings in email subscriptions and staying on top of things there as well as social media i think that's always a good um platform for pursuing newest things all right that's great advice and curiosity go experiment everybody should go and try 11 labs now and victoria thanks for educating us about what's going on in voice ai thanks for having me doug i enjoyed the conversation
Pressure Points: Apple Watch Sales Pause,2023-12-18 20:53:12+00:00,4,AdHx08dwGXY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdHx08dwGXY,i'm gene munster managing partner at deepwater asset management and head of portfolio research and this is pressure points topic is nvidia earnings we're first going to do a setup then we're going to talk about the pressure point and also talk about why isn't the stock up more given the strength and the result so the setup when they reported the april quarter and gave guidance for the july quarter that was 50 percent higher than expected many investors thought that that was not sustainable this is going to be a one-quarter positive phenomenon when they reported july results were 20 percent above those higher numbers and they guided for the october quarter revenue to be up 28 percent so two points do make a trend and it is a level of strength in the business that i haven't witnessed in my 30 years of tech investing that kind of upside two quarters in a row what's ultimately driving this is a shift from cpus to gpus to enable ai applications cpus have been around for decades they do one computation exceptionally well very deep computations where when it comes to ai you need to do parallel smaller more simple calculations that work in tandem gpus are much better at doing that and that's the opportunity that nvidia has been tapping into a lot of their success here has been driven by what's happened with the hyperscalers that's like aws azure google cloud also some of the big tech companies like google and meta and they even said that 15 000 startups are buying their chips so when you put all this together there's just a secular shift going on in terms of how data centers and compute infrastructure is being built and nvidia is the only game in town the reason why nvidia is the only game in town is they also have a coding language a developer language that goes around the chips this is similar to what apple has done around its ios and having it enable hardware sales and what tesla's done around some of their vertical integration related to some of their software applications and selling vehicles nvidia is doing the same thing which is a defensible moat around it so that's the setup which gets us to the results which we talked about but ultimately the pressure point here is that shares are only up three percent if you would have given me these results and said what do you think the stock's going to be doing i would have said it's up 15 and i think one of the reasons why is that investors are thinking more about two years out what ultimately is the growth rate one piece is clear is that this this eye-popping increases in guidance is unlikely because invest analysts will quickly start to revise their models upwardly so we're probably not not going to see these big blowout numbers relative to guidance in the future which gets to the pressure point again is what is nvidia's growth rate in calendar 2025. right now the streets at about 20 percent that compares to about 50 percent encounter 24 and 70 percent this year so it's going 70 50 20. i think that in 2025 the growth rate will be higher than 20 i think it's going to be comfortably higher than 20 percent call it 30 40 maybe even 50 so i think that the next few years are in a good place one of the reasons is that they have this pent-up demand this is rare to see this they talked about getting visibility into next year which is unheard of for a tech company because they're seeing uh the the orders that they cannot fulfill uh just for production uh reasons and so i think that the business has enough momentum the theme around the shift from cpu to gpu has enough momentum that ultimately pushes uh the the growth rates in calendar 25 higher than what investors are thinking so that's the pressure point what's 2025 growth i'll take the over on where investors are thinking because i think nvidia is in a great place separately uh if i want to address why the stock up only three percent as i mentioned i thought it would be up a lot more and i think one of the reasons is just that concept that the results were so good this is the peak and we saw this too many times with apple with the ipod and the iphone they would have these blowout quarters and there would be dissipation going into it and then the stock would sell off in this case nvidia shares are up 15 percent over the past week the nasdaq's up three percent so the sell-off that we're seeing with the broader market and the muted response with nvidia makes sense just given what the stock has done more recently and historically we've seen investors take a step back a few weeks down the road and start to reassess and think about the strength of these fundamentals and the opportunity longer term and start to regain some confidence so to expect the stock to start to base here and trend higher not investment advice but that's how i see the road map ahead and that's a wrap on pressure points please follow me at munster underscore gene on twitter or x whichever you prefer to call it and look forward to seeing you on pressure points next time around bye for now
DeepTech315: Apple & AI,2023-12-21 23:06:39+00:00,16,U_e6oUF8iFw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_e6oUF8iFw,for deep water asset management i'm gene munster our topic today is the iphone 15 release date it's a big day for years truly i also upgraded today to the iphone 15 pro this is my first phone in a couple years my previous was the 13 mini i do miss that smaller form factor i wish you'd come in a pro model please note anyone from apple listening to this video i want to hit four key takeaways first is that i think demand is in a good place for iphone 15 and the iphone family which i think should be positive for the september results second is what the killer features are on the phone third is what i've been surprised about today which is the setup experience and fourth why that is a competitive advantage for apple we'll start with the iphone demand and this is looking at iphone lead times on their global websites eight different different countries we track that of course a lot of people track that what's most important is to start tracking those a few days after the initial surge to see if kind of that holds and what we've noted on day four through day seven is that the lead times and all four models have been steadily increasing our note today is going to kind of map in what those lead times increase in our but most importantly the pro models are running four to five weeks that's a similar lead time as a year ago and in september of 22 different economic background backdrop and at that time the iphone grew at 9.8 percent year over year this quarter september 23 analysts are expecting iphone to be down a couple percent i would expect a little bit of upside in that and i think that the lead times this year being comparable to what they are last year or similar four to five weeks last year gives some credibility that we should have a decent iphone number there is of course with these lead times some debate how helpful are they in my experience over the past decade is directionally when lead times are long that is a positive again they're long and are comparable to the lengths that they were a year ago second is the killer feature this one i'm probably the only person to highlight this is the killer future feature the reason why i decided to upgrade was to get spatial video when i demoed vision pro back in june i was blown away that to me was the killer feature related to spatial video i believe it's as big of a jump from steel photography to video as from video to spatial video and i want to start capturing memories in spatial as soon as possible obviously vision pro is not out yet but that feature to me got me over the top unfortunately that feature is not available today as they said when they announced the new iphones a few weeks ago that will be out later this year but i've got the hardware to back it up and looking forward to that i think the shortcut customizable shortcut button is something else that i liked about it but on the feature front it's still largely the same as iphone 14 which gets to our third point is what is significant here it's important to note that the average upgrader over the next year not today but over the next year is going to be coming from a probably an iphone 11 or iphone 12. and what that means is that for them the step up is material even though from 14 to 15 it's a nominal step up it will be material for people who are upgrading from a few years ago so there is enough substance around the product but one piece of the whole experience which has been top of mind for me today is just how easy it is to upgrade and set up the phone and a couple days ago i got a message in my settings tab that said you are due to get an iphone in a couple days you want to do you want to start preparing by backing up your phone to icloud when the phone came today at 9 00 am delivered through ups right on launch date i timed it out it took 33 minutes for me to update basically switch my phone that included moving the phone number over all my passwords and settings there were eight taps that i was required to make during those 33 minutes they included picking language and country setting up face id the the code on a credit card for apple pay so some of these were very block and tackle but the substance of all the little details of bringing your phone up to speed are all covered by apple which to me was the really the headline of today is just the way they make things easy and i think that that is important because the easier that they make these upgrading the products it increases the likelihood for the frequency of upgrades it's easy to upgrade people who want to upgrade more often but more importantly is it really locks you into the experience you basically get to a point where you're almost afraid for me to jump to an android phone i would be nervous just at losing some important photos or emails data kind of backing up that that would be something i wouldn't even want to experience and so i think this setup experience they do it so well is a competitive advantage which ultimately gets to why i think that apple shares should trade at a higher premium than most tech companies in consumer staples i estimate that apple has about 1.1 billion active users now they announced that there's 2.1 billion active devices recently but active users i think it's about half of that and that is a sign of a a large base obviously but not only is it large but the frequency that those users interact with the products is many times a day potentially hundreds of times a day and i think that that is fits the definition of a consumer staple company and as they continue to make the products easier to use like we have with the setup today i think it's going to continue to lock people into uh their uh their apple experience and they're going to continue to buy more apple devices which ultimately i think is going to yield a company over the long term that grows at probably five percent plus but yields a higher multiple than most companies because it's so sustainable investors can sleep well at night knowing that the iphone is going to be delivered on time that it's going to be a great setup experience and is going to encourage their consumers to come back and buy more products that keeps not only their apple's customers but apple investors happy on behalf of deep water asset management on this notable day i'm gene munster and bye for now
DeepTech315: Deepwater's 2024 Predictions,2023-12-28 16:37:48+00:00,14,c-bQLQzoh-k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-bQLQzoh-k,"welcome to deep tech 315 our first topic of course is wwdc this is an event that back on march 26 i started to get really excited for in part because of what the company had been saying just after their march earnings but also the uh commentary from greg jaws head of marketing and he had posted that wwc is going to be absolutely incredible with the emphasis on ai there so we knew this was coming and the media did a great job and all the writers out there did a great job of predicting what was going to be said at the event so i'm gonna give you first turn at the mic here what did you make of the event two lenses i think you should look at the event through the first is the true just ai nerd lens like us you know if you're engrossed in the ai world i don't think you saw anything from apple with apple intelligence that we haven't really already seen from google gemini gpt and so it didn't blow the nerds away and that was kind of to there was nothing new nothing really new but i think for the apple customer the average apple customer and this is a point i think you've been making some of these features i think are going to be really appealing to them um the idea of having a phone where siri has been so long promised and so underd delivered but the idea that siri might actually work for the average customer i think is is kind of a decently big deal um and this is also just the beginning i think that's the other thing that's important too when you think about the average customer this may be their first forray into really using ai at scale on a regular basis and apple intelligence will only get better from here so i think for that customer they probably are excited and should be excited yeah and on that kind of using ai at scale for the average person so this they've got this small language model that's going to run on your device they also have a private cloud that's going to somehow play into that but the basic idea is i i think of this as something that they that you would use uh many times an hour it would be sending an email a text message uh it could be something related to photos uh some digital organization finding different files this is just the the constant oh this is nice it's a lot better with ai and i think that's going to be powerful and of course that they can do that because the privacy view uh at least they've made it very clear that's uh they see that as one of their big selling points and then on the flip side you've got the open ai relationship and that kind of opens up the uh the the the more advanced more complex things like we use generative ai for today and there're you know you'll kind of have that seamlessly in there so getting that friction out of the way is a big deal i'm curious uh when you think about those two pieces their model their small language model opening eyes big model uh where do you think the percentage of of time is going to be or or usage of consumer ai is going to be on apple intelligence i would bet that the majority of it is going to go just through that small language first the first layer yeah because and and that's the thing right you think about what are you trying to do at least today this may change over time i think that's an interesting question too but today it's going to be things like send an email send a text right uh set set a timer the classic siri request maybe it'll really work this time um but i think that's where it starts is is let me do things faster on my phone functions that are simple and within my phone and then i actually think over time and i don't know if that's one year or like three years away people get used to using a and then they really want to do complex stuff and that probably gets offload yeah as i kind of stepped back and took it all in the sense that i had is i really want this because it's just going to take a lot of the friction out of getting access to ai and apply it to things that i've wanted to apply ai to of course i'm i'm based on on all the apple products and so opening this up to me is is a big is a big deal on the the series side we talked about that kind of previewing the event and the importance of sirus and interface and i guess the ultimately is that going to be the main vehicle do you think over over time where people just interact with apple intelligence at least in the beginning kind of like we were saying i think it probably will be it will be you know again the idea i think of most simply is kind of a siri that actually does what we all hoped it would do like 10 years ago which is still cool like i mean i think that's still a great idea but they tweet too they did keep the name they tweaked it now they allow you to do text input too so for me almost like siri is less about like this personal assistant it's more just like this is the new the ui to their more advanced ai yeah just a more dynamic interaction set for the phone and there's two things there two two paths i want to take one is i was actually somewhat surprised that they didn't kill the siri brand i thought there was a chance they might do that just because it's been so tough fair to restart right and they didn't do that and now i think siri kind of has something to prove you know this does have to work um but the second derivative of that though is talking about okay like what happens in the extreme if this works and and we talk about contrarian ideas a lot at deep water and one way i like to push to think about contrarian ideas is takes something to the far extreme what if apple intelligence is so good that you don't even want to pick up your phone anymore and the world in let's say five years looks kind of like the movie her that we've all talked about right you have an earpiece and you just talk to it this is like humane we're talking about right yes yeah and and so like actually push it to the extreme if apple intelligence is super successful it actually changes apple's business in a really big way where they may not sell a lot of phones anymore they might just sell this little server that lives in your pocket i don't know if that'd be a good thing or a bad thing you still need a screen though don't you maybe but i don't know if you need as much uh as much like with the camera and some of the other stuff that goes into making a phone if it was really just sort of this like ai communicator device right like maybe that's much more simple i don't know if you'd pay you know 1,500 bucks every couple years for one of those maybe it's a little bit less often you buy it and maybe it's a little cheaper the form factor we didn't see at wwdc obviously saw it at google's developer conference and i think would be incredible in the use case you just showed is just some form of glasses i'm not talking about vision pro where we're taking the digital world and overlaying it with the real world i'm talking eyes on the real world rayband type of glasses it just have a pretty simple camera in it but i think uh you could like that to me is a 10x better type of just a second set of eyes just watching what you're doing i think there's actually something really cool apple could do there that i've heard people rumor a little bit about which is build cameras into airpods now it doesn't give you the visual in your line of sight and that might be a good thing but imagine if you had airpods that could see and then you could also that's kind of all you want cool yeah i think that might be better than glasses actually maybe we'll see the uh piece that as we go to our second topic which is thinking beyond just the event and uh think about the stock and it had a nice move after it had kind of sold off a couple percent on the news the classic buy in the rumor sell on the news and then we saw this kind of surge uh after and that of course in part was because the uh talk that or the the the understanding that these ai features are only going to run on iphone 15 pro and later by my math call it 2.3 billion devices you throw out airpods you throw out apple tv uh you assume that 15% of those are either on an m1 device or uh some form of iphone 15 pro or better you get to about 1.9 billion devices out there that are gna have to be upgraded to use these and so the market uh reacting positively in part to that and i know we've had conversations about other factors and i want to say my belief is that the stock is moving predominantly um when you have that big of a market cap adding $300 billion predominantly on a belief that growth is going to step up and uh when i look at the numbers uh this year the street's looking for overall growth to be about 5% um i think that's not going to change based on any this a lot of these features aren't going to come out till the end of this year but next year we start to get some momentum around some of those upgrades and i think growth can be 10% plush-ish and then we go to 20126 and i think we probably see 12 14 15% growth another a step up and then it starts declining probably after that so we got this kind of two-year window when we've gone from no growth to growth and i think that was one of the big drivers of the stock it's currently trading at 30 times i'll throw one other piece out there around uh the the stock it didn't impact necessarily those first couple days of trading but mark gman bloomberg does such a good job he reported on something that you and i predicted would happen which is that apple's not paying open ai for the access to the model they're essentially paying them in the form of distribution and and so over time there may be some other opportunities for the companies to make money together but the another piece of this is they're doing a great job of scaling ai in a cost effective way and so i think about maybe even more margin upside so from my perspective we're going to get some revenue growth returning margin upside and it uh it makes logical sense about the move despite how crazy it seemed given 300 billion but that's where i take but i know you had a slightly different view on it i think when you see big moves like that i mean we're talking about 11% for the biggest company now again the biggest company in the world now that they've had that move um there are other things that are going on i think other than people just adjusting their fundamental perspectives i think that's definitely part of it but i think there's also factors of likely buybacks i mean there was talk uh uh about i think buybacks from the goldman desk for example some of the activity this week was much more elevated than it had been um apple obviously has a very big buyback program so there's probably some flows there there's momentum then that you get chasing that there is obviously fundamental investors coming in and saying hey there is a there's a new growth story here that maybe we start to believe in so i think they're all factors to say that the entire 11% move is just based on apple intelligence i thinke i would say particular doesn't make sense just given what the stock did after the event i mean the stock was down a little bit after the event if it was that big of a of a deal that investors were all of a sudden excited about it would have moved you know probably more in line on the day of the event to either way though i think the bottom line is it doesn't really matter why it's doing what it's doing over the last two days ultimately right if you're an apple investor if you're thinking about the stock you want to see it continue to be able to do this and for the stock to keep working now they have to deliver you know now they have to show that device growth you talked about and it's kind of a you know show me next right 25 for that i mean they can kind of mess up basically for the next couple quarters i think people would probably say forget it's a whole new company on the on the flip side of it uh we don't give investment advice on deep tech 315 but from an investor perspective i think what they're seeing is a$ nine number in calendar 26 you pick the multiple it's currently trading at 30 times if you believe that word an ai are going to go into an ai bull market um even that this is going to continue i think you can argue for multiple expansion i think there's still measurable meaningful upside to apple we're going to pause there because we got one more topic to get to which is speaking of uh billions of dollars not 300 billion but 48 billion uh elon got his pay package approved uh so um i was happy to see that and uh shareholders are getting a 9% delution but they're also getting elon's uh attention and my question is like how much how much does he really he doesn't care about the money does he like is this is this a a principles thing for him i think partly i mean that it was already agreed to the fact that a court was sort of objecting to this uh seemed a little i don't know out of place to me i mean this is this is a pay package that has been in place and every you know people have played this history already when it was instituted back in i think it was 2018 the the numbers were so high the metrics were so high and crazy like nobody believed he was going to hit them anyway and he did you know and now it's like well okay we thought it was crazy then when now we're going to pay you $48 billion that's a problem well that doesn't make sense if you already already stamped it right and from a shareholder perspective if you don't like this pay package and you're frustrated with the board then the shareholders should try to then ou the board and put in a different uh set of candidates but bottom line is this i mean i think you know they followed typical uh good shareholder governance here now it's approved ratified by the shareholders and hopefully we can kind of move on and get back to talking about get elon more excited about directing those nvidia chips to austin versus to xai i know there's narrative around that i personally would doubt that he's thinking about the world that much that way that if he didn't get his pay package that he would short i think he would have i think he would have just siphoned i think he's i think he's just trying to build great companies right it's like i think he does want obviously the financial incentive and he's using that money to build these other companies too that's i think that's probably all part of the calculus but i don't i think the idea that he would all of a sudden put tesla as a second class citizen to some of his other companies just if he didn't get paid i don't buy that fully no okay final 5c answer to this if you got paid $48 billion pre-tax so we'll call it uh 22 after tax what do you do with it 5c answer i would just keep doing what i was doing whatever it was i was hoping you would say that we're gonna keep doing this we'll be back at you next week and on behalf of deep tech bye for now"
Pressure Points: Tesla Q4 Deliveries,2024-01-02 21:34:30+00:00,6,z1mils5rR0s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1mils5rR0s,[music] welcome to pressure points i'm jean monster and our topic today is microsoft's ignite ai developer day we had the keynote that was of course came from saa nadela and before i get into the pressure point i want to talk just highest level about what's going on this keynote had a lot of layers to it many announcements i think most of it was developer talk pretty geeky focused on the most hard core ai integration people and i think that the significance of what microsoft is doing can get lost amidst all these little announcements and what they're doing is making it easier to build gpts and ai functionality into their core products whether it's office azure or teams and so score one for microsoft winning developers over talking about why this revolution is happening today and giving a lot of incremental pieces to how these developers can ride that wave so that's kind of the highest level but that was not the pressure point the pressure point the piece that stood out most today was related to announcements that microsoft is doing in silicon and satia discussed this idea of silicon diversity and specifically is microsoft is going to be building their own cpus now all the other big hyperscalers like google and amazon are also building their own cpus and potentially gpus and this of course begs the question of why is microsoft doing this what does this mean for envidia and amd and the reason why they're doing this is hardware is really important when it comes to training and inference in ai and we've seen what's happened to nvidia's business over the past nine months and there is this competition for access to the these compute platforms or the hardware like nvidia and so playing it forward is microsoft along with the other big companies want to diversify and so they're doing their own cpus still going to be purchasing gpus from nvidia one of the surprises related to this was they announced other partnerships and ceo of and founder of nvidia joined satia on screen on stage and they discussed how this partnership is getting deeper and deeper the reality is this is a similar moment to back when apple in like 2005 announced the rocker integration where they're putting itunes on a motorola rocker phone and this great uh relationship that they're going to be doing with motorola where in reality apple is moving in a whole different direction i think microsoft along with the other big companies want to have some insurance against getting beholden to nvidia and so i suspect that uh that is going to be a theme that we're going to be hearing more chip development silicon development from microsoft and the others so the pressure point really here was microsoft winding silicon dependency why that's important is that it's good for margins longer term because it gives the hyperscalers a chance to build this really important infrastructure at a lower cost scale when they're doing it internally and so uh that's the pressure point as i said there are a lot of other uh little points and i just want to put a spotlight over on one shiny little point to wrap us up this doesn't hit the threshold for pressure points but is worth mentioning at the end of the keynote satia mentioned this integration between ai and effectively the metaverse or ai and spatial computing and he showed a teaser video about what looked like how lens essentially in a technical industrial work environment imagine somebody working on like jet engines things like that wearing these glasses and asking co-pilot for advice as you're going along hollow lens came out in the developer kit in 2016 it hasn't really really gone anywhere but what satio is saying is that ai really powers spatial computing effectively and of course this is apple's vision 2 so the other shiny piece not for this pressure point episode but i think we're going to see a showdown here coming up between microsoft and apple around these spatial computing devices obviously metas in there to with everything they're doing with reality labs but it's going to start to get more there's going to be more substance behind this and i think the concept and the utility of spatial computing is elevated after today's event and i think you're going to hear more about this from other big companies trying to really use ai in a new way related to spatial computing so that was a shiny thing on the side and that's a wrap for this episode of pressure points bye for now
DeepTech315: Apple Downgrades / Perplexity / Intelligent Alpha,2024-01-04 21:23:26+00:00,16,3D0gDeLCjX4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D0gDeLCjX4,"welcome to pressure points i'm jean mster our topic tonight is apple's scary fast event prime time event first time and the pressure point is the mac business before we jump into that recap what was announced tonight it was apple's first three nanometer chips they include both a cpu and a gpu component to it and that's all on a single chip and these chips are of course sold through bind max apple doesn't sell the chips to other third parties of course this is different than nvidia's gpu business where they're selling them to hyperscalers like azure and aws the some of those language around the event did bring in ai and some model training and ai developers that was talked about but just to be clear this is about selling max which gets us to the pressure point and the mac business as a point of perspective is about 10% of overall sales it's been a roller coaster poster of growth rates in the 5 years before the pandemic it was up an average 2% a year and then it jumped up to 23% growth in fiscal 21 and in this uh september quarter it's probably going to be down around 26% so we've seen this pretty significant drop off in the last couple quarters and the real substance here is that you need to grow the mac business even though this is a business that gets overlooked it is 10% of sales it does matter and it's important that they get this to being more or less a flattish business and i expect that with these updates uh they will likely move to up slightly in the december quarter probably up 5 to 7% in the december quarter which is in line with estimates but this should do the trick in terms of getting the mac back to a more level baseline kind of up a couple percent a year type of a run rate so that's the pressure point i would say there was the postcript to that one piece that was entertaining to see was what they did with some of the pricing they lower the price of the 14-in macbook pro that has this new m3 chip in it from call it $2,000 to $1,600 but they also eliminated the 13-in macbook pro which uh previously had started at $1,300 and so effectively they're raising the the entry level price of the macbook pro family by 23% and uh they're going to they're going to get away with this i think because consumers are going to see a lot of value in these new better faster chips so this is the gift that keeps given for apple this the gift of speed and it's going to manifest itself in improving max sales on behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now"
DeepTech315:  CES / Tech Layoffs / Hertz EV Sales,2024-01-11 22:21:23+00:00,16,xs1Ttshnw88,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs1Ttshnw88,"welcome to pressure points i'm jean monster our topic today is tesla's september quarter preview they're going to be reporting on october 18th that's a wednesday and the pressure point is automotive gross margins excluding credits and so we're going to first talk about why margins are so important for tesla investors and then talk about the september quarter outlook on the topic december outlook and then our graball other things to be thinking about so going back to why are margins so important for tesla investors and the reason is that they are the battleground between is tesla a high margin tech company or a low margin traditional car maker and over the last 6 months tesla's operating margin one way to measure that is 14% and that compares to traditional car makers at 8% and so it's higher but it still lags what is the gold standard of operating margin when it comes to hardware software and services and that of course is apple and they're at 38% more recently so there is a lot of room for tesla needs to close the gap to be considered an apple like operating margin story but there's definitely room where they can expand their current margins i think ultimately they get to 25% plus over the next 3 to 5 years and i think traditional car makers they're as i mentioned at 8% more recently i think over the next decade their margins are actually going to decline because i think the transition to electric is going to be more costly and so that's the setup and of course when we talk about three five 10 years each of those is built by quarterly expectations which gets us to the september quarter uh the analysts are expecting for automotive gross margins x credits of 18.2% that's up from 18.1% in the uh june quarter my expectation is that they they're going to miss that number i think it comes in more like 17.5 to 17.8% and the reason is there are two headwinds that i think analysts weren't anticipating when they did their models three months ago the first was the uh retooling that happened at giga shanghai related to the new version of model 3 highland that cut production efficiencies declined when you stop production and that causes the cost per other vehicle to to increase uh separately is that there was we'll call it a below the fold price reduction in the us the tesla was giving discounts i estimated it was about 4% on average for cars in inventory i think it probably impacted less than 10,000 vehicles but it is something that was a headwind in the september quarter so when you put it together expect a slight miss there and i'm just playing this through as the numbers come out that's probably stock reacts negative to that and then as we uh shift gears and get to the earnings call i'm hoping they give some commentary about what the al is for december i think it's going to show improvement from over september and specifically is that uh the biggest tailwind i think that it go improves from september and ends at probably something like 18.4% that's where analysts are currently at for the december quarter so i think that december number is a good number i think they'll be able to and will stick with that number up post earnings and the reason is they have a tailwind the biggest tailwind in the quarter is related to volume improvement production volumes are going to improve and that's going to lift efficiencies it's basically the opposite of what happened in september in this case it's because shanghai is up and running again and overall we should see about a 10% increase sequentially in the production numbers that gets them to that 1.8 million number for the full year so a 10% uh step up should improve margins quarter on quarter there is a neutral factor in on october 3rd or october 5th tesla lowered their pricing of some vehicles in the us uh when you factor in the mix on those price reductions and the uh the fact that it was us only it probably is a one% kind of headwind to pricing for the quarter but they've also eliminated that inventory discount that they gave so there's a little bit of a tailwind when you put that together so the net of all of this is i think the december street expectations of 18.4% are going to be good and analysts will say uh that margins are expanding from september to december so that's the pressure point i do just want to talk about the other category couple topics one other thing i'm listening closely for is just of course what's happening with cyber truck and how that's ramping i think they're going to do less than 5,000 cyber trucks this year it's going to take longer than we think to get there eventually i think cyber truck could be 20 to 25% of total tesla vehicles be 350,000 plus per year in the next few years uh that is uh still below what the f-150 sells in the us they sold in 2022 over 600,000 f-150s globally most of those were in the us but there is a case that there's a big market for light trucks and cyber truck is going to be playing into that the rumored weight list for this is around 2 million i think the real weight list is probably a million 1 million and spread that over a few years and you get to call it 300,000 plus vehicles per year so cyber trucks one thing to be keeping a close eye on and another is related to changes in tax credit and want to give credit here to rob mau from tesla daily podcast he does such good work on tesla and rob talked about the impact of at the end of the year we're likely going to see a reduction and the $7,500 price cut likely goes to 3750 that would increase the average cost of tesla by about 6% in the us um but there could be some changes on the positive side related to the tax credit some changes where uh consumers can recognize the tax credit at the time of purchase today when you use the tax credit uh there are first you have to have a tax liability to offset that not everybody has that and separately you got to wait like 12 plus months to get the money back so there may be some changes where they allow you to do that uh instant gratification and recognize that tax credit uh right away so uh thank you rob for that and something else to think about as we navigate estimat for the first part of 2024 we're going to have more to come in about a week and on behalf of pressure points deep water i'm jean monster bye for now"
Pressure Points: TSMC,2024-01-18 16:57:10+00:00,6,jcVR6ufS0ME,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcVR6ufS0ME,welcome to frontier and center i'm jean monster from deepwater and as a reminder frontier and center is a weekly podcast we talk about frontier tech frontier tech by definition is what is going to change our lives in the next three to five years and the components of frontier tech have the flexibility to focus on where most of that innovation is coming from of course ai is a big focus more recently and has become a bigger part of the deep waterer frontier tech etf that ticker is l and we kick off each episode by going over the performance of the etf year-to date it's up 1% that compares the nasdaq that's up 3 and a half% and since inception in 2018 it's up 68% so focusing on each week we talk about a company this week's company is amd uh you may have heard it more recently amd is a chip provider uh the company really got it start as a secondary supplier uh for companies like compact and and dell as they were buying so many chips from intel they did not want to be beholden to intel and so intel licensed some of the te their technology to amd and they got their start making cpus and that's been a big part of the amd story up until recently and when we think about how the chip market has evolved more recently it's really broken down into to two levels first is cpus uh central processing units this has been the bread and butter of compute for the past 40 years and then more recently related to gpus and this is graphics processing units and these are more adept at doing training and inference for artificial intelligence and the three big companies that get talked about are on the cpu side is intel they're just starting to get more into gpus but most most their businesses cpus and on that front intel has about 70% share in the us and amd has about 20% share of cpus and then uh we have on the other side is on the gpu side of course that's led by nvidia with their incredible growth growing in their current january quarter at close to 300% off of big numbers so it's been an impressive run for nvidia and then the company in between has been amd they have a c puu business and they have a gpu business and that gpu business has been around for a little bit uh it's it's increased in in terms of the the impact on the business so i'm going to go back if you look at in uh in 2022 fiscal 22 amd did 300 million in their gpu business 300 million in the december quarter of 2023 they did 500 million just in that quarter and they have raised the exp expectations about what they believe that the gpu business will do in 2024 from initially 2 billion that's what they talked about their analyst day back in november 2 billion to now 4 a5 billion and there are some expectations that it will be even north of 4 and a half billion for 2024 so just seen some incredible growth in amg's gpu business and they just announced a new product within that it is the m1 mi30 and that is their next generation gpu and so that's what's also fueling some of this growth so bottom line is amd is doing a great job of pivoting to where most of the spending is going on when it comes to ai training and inference and that's on the gpu side and because of that the stock has done exceptionally well over the past year if you look at the valuation of amd it's uh currently trades at about 30 times 2025 earnings that's a a simp similar eps multiple as nvidia it's going to be growing faster in some of those out years and has a $288 billion market cap so uh this the advantage here of owning amd is you've got more potential growth because uh that business is small i mentioned that's four five six 1010 billion do gpu business to put that into perspective is nvidia in any given quarter will do $18 billion plus in in a given quarter so when you put this all together as you look at the gpu business amd has about 12% share of the gpu business there's room for them to increase that and that's one of the pieces that we're optimistic about and taking it even to the highest level the reason why this is part of frontier tech is that the silicon piece is a really hard uh critical layer to building ai and there's only a few companies that can ultimately power that and we want to make sure that we have exposure to that theme from a silicon base a very defensible base so i'm behalf of this week's frontier and center i'm jean bye for now
Frontier & Center: Intro to Front & Center / Nubank,2024-01-18 20:52:16+00:00,8,7E2h7wof03k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E2h7wof03k,[music] welcome to pressure points i am jean monster our topic today is meta earnings this is pressure points i'm going to preview the pressure point which is daily active users and before we dive into that i'm going to take a few steps back and talk about the noise around the quarter and when meta reported results shares were up about 3% through the midpoint of their earnings call until a question came up related to the impact of the geopolitical environment on revenue and cfo susan lee mentioned that they have seen some softness in the last couple weeks and that's similar to what they saw with the beginning of the ukraine war and she couldn't attribute it specifically but just some general softness when cfo of a tech company uses the word softness look out the stock is going down and that's exactly what happened immediately it started to trade down and as of this recording it's trading down 3% so it's had a 6% move based on that comment and i want to put a little bit of context to that is that comment was factored into the company's guidance which was for december 2% higher than the street in other words if they wouldn't have seen this geopolitical softness the guidance would have likely been even higher but since they've seen it it's uh been modestly lower but still higher than where analysts were before so the net of this is the demand for their business is in a good spot i think the stock reaction also speaks to just how sensitive investors are to any negative comment but i wanted to give my take on that before we dive into the pressure point which is daily active users daus are critical because that is the foundation that meta builds all of their products and their engagement and their revenue on top of over the past few years da growth has slowed because their base is getting big it currently is at 2.1 billion which is 25% of the world's population visits a meta property daily and when you get to those big numbers it's just really hard to grow but over the past three quarters the da growth has been accelerating going from about 2.8% year-over-year growth to 5.4% in the most recent quarter and so accelerating a growth number off of a number that's very difficult to grow is impressive and that lays the foundation for how they can continue to grow revenue faster and one way that they can do that is through reels and this has been a net drag on revenue as they basically have been redirecting traffic from instagram over to reals and not monetizing on reels as much but they did say that in 2024 re should be a tailwind to revenue so it's going to be a revenue contributor a net revenue contributor which is a shift it's important and that really sets up 2025 for reals to be a bigger deal that of course is the tik tock competitor and look forward to seeing how that product can lift off of build off of that massive daily active user base but even beyond reals that daily active user base is a foundation where they can get more generative ai products and zuckerberg talked a lot about this on the call they also talked a lot about this at their connect conference and at the most basic level what metas products do is their entertainment and the ability for generative ai to make it easier to entertain easier for creators to create content and easier for people like you and i to build our own fun content and just create a platform where people want to come to and spend time so those tools are important those generative tools can also be used by advertisers which of course are really important to meta those advertisers can use those to try different ad campaigns more efficiently get recommendations on creative even make adjustments to text and uh photos and video and so there is a unique opportunity that meta has given their two billion daily active users to start to weave more ative ai products into which should increase engagement and ultimately that engagement should improve monetization the last question on the conference call was related to that how big can this be these generative ai applications and that was relative to reals or stories and zuckerberg's answer was he doesn't know but it definitely has potential and so my sense is it can be bigger than that i think the creator economy is going to surprise people in the next decade and i think meta is going to be a beneficiary of that that's one of the reasons why deep water owns shares of meta uh that's the pressure point daily active users i want to just do a quick postcript on a couple other topics that were relevant one was related to margins margins were operating margins 40% the highest in two and a half years it's even higher than it was pre pandemic 2019 margins were at 33% % and so they've seen a nice step up and those likely will increase slightly next year as well the one negative is reality labs and the amount that they're spending on that they're talking about continuing to aggressively spend in that it's probably going to be 15 billion a year that's about half of what apple spends for total r&d a year 30 billion it's just a lot of money and i'm a big believer in spatial computing i think vision pro is going to surprise people i think apple's got a tiger by the tail there i think apple's product is 10 times better than quest product at this point i think there still is a market it's also by the way 10 times more expensive than quest product and i think there's two markets there i think there's a market for those who want to spend a lot for the best experience and i think those are there's a market for those who don't want to spend as much and get 80% of the experience and so i think it's the right call for them to continue to invest in reality labs but it's just a lot more aggressive than i feel comfortable with i would feel more comfortable if they were spending five billion a year in reality labs either way you cut it one of two things is going to happen with reality labs it's either going to work and we're all going to be happy or it's not going to work and they're going to cut spending and we're all going to be happy so i think it's heads we win tails we don't lose type of a scenario with reality labs that's a wrap for this episode of pressure points i'm jean on behalf of deep water bye for now
DeepTech315: Vision Pro / AI Bubble & TSMC / App Store Battle,2024-01-19 17:30:04+00:00,18,PDWysCnwt0I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWysCnwt0I,"for pressure points i'm jean monster for deep waterer asset management our topic today is vision pro why the developer community is the pressure point and central to the success of this product and why i believe that eventually it's going to be a hit albe it takes some time we're going to talk about the investor psychology related to vision pro separately look at iphone and its growth trajectory and the impact of developers then we're going to do the same thing for watch and conclude by talking about the outlook for vision pro for the next 5 to8 years so back to the top just to level set here vision pro it's about spatial computing that's similar to augment to reality or mixed reality or metaverse from meta's language but all these are basically bringing digital items into the real world it's a new computing paradigm so that's what vision pro is all about the investor expectations for this product are modest at best most are skeptical about this potential success of this given meta has been in the market and their product quest has not sold well they sell between six and 7 million units a year that compares to about 230 million iphones sold a year and so that disappointment i think has really set the stage for this skeptical view related to vision pro's potential i would uh wager that those are of those of you who are skeptical of vision pro and its potential haven't tried the product i've demoed it it is lights out good and i think it's going to surprise people and investors and developers alike when we start to see it and call it five to six months from now so that's the setup next in terms of learning from iphone related to the developer community and this is really the key points related to today's episode is that the iphone wasn't always a hit it came out in 2007 i remember in that first year sales were bouncing around not hitting expectations and one investor calling me saying this product is dead on arrival and the reason was initially the iphone really sold itself as a desktop browsing experience on mobile same with maps on mobile and of course bringing an ipod into the phone but the true utility the shift from that device to a computer in your pocket didn't happen for about 5 years and we went back and looked and over the first 5 years there were only 10 blockbuster apps that were released these are apps like facebook and instagram uber venmo airbnb uh tik tok they're the central apps to our mobile experience today but they're only 10 of them in that first 5 years but those 10 collectively changed the whole utility of the phone and we started to see an uptick in sales in year five iphone unit sales accelerated to 93% from 90% in year four now that may seem small just going from 90 to 93% but when you're comping against large numbers just any acceleration and growth is justification for an inflection point there were other factors in year five the first large screen iphone came out iphone 5 there was broader global distribution but i think that the developer community was the primary driver of that inflection point next we're going to look at watch there also was a case that the utility right out of the gate was a disappointment this product was released in 2015 and it took two years before investors started to be to see the light the first two years units were basically flat year on year and it was in that year three where apple really picked up the ball and they developed on their own about 20 apps and new features many of those around wellness and connectivity that started to unlock the utility of the watch and in that year three uh specifically is when cellular uh connectivity came out for watch that kind of opened up a new call it 25% of users to watch that really started to quicken the pace of adoption so in year three we saw 43% unit growth uh compared to flat in year two and so there was an inflection point but it took three years for watch to essentially hit that point but thanks to apple essentially for carrying the ball thirdparty developers haven't done much for apple watch it's really been apple itself that's been building those features and apps so what does all of this mean when you put it together and i think for the next five years vision pro is going to be a slow start and i think that investors shouldn't be worried about that this technology is so much more advanced than what's in a phone it's going to be more difficult for developers to build these gamechanging apps so it's going to take time and just like the iphone uh but take even more time but i don't think investors should lose hope because eventually this product is so strong on a tech perspective there is going to be a developer community that's going to find ways to make money and build applications that we can't live without so if we fast forward 5 years down the road and think of a similar trajectory as what it took for iphone developers to get on board i think that year call it 2028 2029 is when it gets more exciting related to vision pro and at that time too we should start to see lower prices the 3500 is clearly a headwind but i think five plus years from now we should see the product between ,000 and $2,000 which should open it up to a bigger market putting it all together i think that that patience is going to pay off when it comes to vision pro don't lose hope this is an incredible product and really is a breakthrough when it comes to how humanity is going to be uh interacting with machines and i think apple's going to hold a poll position in this and ultimately i think this product can be greater than 10% of apple's revenue uh that is going to be slightly greater than what the mac and the ipad are is a point of perspective and so i uh believe that this is ultimately going to be something that's going to generate value for those skeptical investors today on behalf of pressure points and deep water i'm jean bye for now"
Frontier & Center: Unity Software (U),2024-01-24 19:14:22+00:00,8,X25QbpcwN88,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X25QbpcwN88,"welcome to pressure points i'm jean mster from deepwater asset management our topic tonight is tesla's september quarter earnings the pressure point is related to profitability this is a bonus episode we're also going to cover cybertruck fsd and the bigger picture related to tesla but want to start with the all important margin category and just for the headline here is in their prepared remarks tesla used the word challenging twice in the june quarter they never mentioned the word challenging and i think that's the context related to margins so previewing this we talked about the all important metric was of course autog gross margins excluding credits that came in at 16.3% the street estimates were 17.6% and it was 29% about a year and a half ago and so that propability has been declining in part because of lowering prices also volumes have declined so there's a efficiency piece that has been pressuring margins and the key question that of course investors are asking is for tesla to be a tech company they need to have higher margins than traditional automakers and so as i mentioned the gross margin 16.3% that would compare to other automakers right around 10 11% and so it still is higher but that gap has closed significantly over the past year and a half which begs the question for investors when are these margins going to improve and on the call it there was some optimism initially after the report of the quarter that they would uh give some optimism related to improving margins but instead they really tamped down uh the expectations and talked about the ramp of cybertruck which we talk about in a second and some of the investments related to that when that will reach efficient scale and also talked about just a challenging ma macro environment that can dampen overall demand and even though they didn't give explicit guidance for margin for the december quarter my sense is that it's going to be flattish from where it was in september in that 16 and a. half% area and probably won't see a move materially higher for a year plus until they start to see more scale related to cyber truck and so when that reality kind of sunk in shares in the aftermarket were trading down 1% and then they kind of drifted down four or 5% i would expect in trading on thursday that that would continue to decline the pressure would continue to be on shares of tesla and so the oneliner on margins is they were lower than expected they're probably going to be in this range for the next year plus second topic is related to cyber truck they did give a release date that is november 30th and said that it's going to take about a year and a half for volumes to ramp up to to 250,000 they did mention that they have a million pre-orders that's a impressive number of those i estimate half or 75% are real buyers which means that in about a year to two years cyber truck should exceed the king of light trucks in the us that of course the f-150 in terms of total volume there is going to be a question about in year three and four does cybertruck continue to uh outpace the f-150 usually what happens you'll have a burst in demand as the pre-orders get filled this is what happened with the model 3 and then you see kind of a pull back but safe to say is that consumer interest in uh the cyber truck is significant and that should pose a challenge to all the other truck makers that tend to be some of their higher margin business elon had a lot of colorful language when it came to cybertruck he mentioned that when you build a product a once in a-lifetime product you dig your own grave when it comes to profitability and reaching scale and just how difficult of a vehicle this is to ramp production and so i think that the light will go on with investors as these start to make their way into the market beginning next year and i think that there will be some optimism and that this should have a positive impact on overall units although it will pressure margins and so patience is a virtue when it comes to cybertruck i think it will deliver on the hype and ultimately be one of the leading light truck vehicles in the us next is related to fsd this of course is the holy grail in terms of unlocking margin opportunity but also has been the boy that's cried wolf for the past six years in terms of when we're close to fsd the number of miles that were driven was just over 500 million called it 520 that's up from 300 million at the end of the june quarter and 150 million when tesla reported their june quarter they talked about this exponential ramp they're going to see in miles driven so that left me with the belief that we're going to have over 600 million miles driven basically a double again from the previous quarter and we just fell a little bit below that which was a disappointment elon was quick to remind people that essentially we'll have a chat gp type of moment when it comes to ai as more model training is going on we should see the effectiveness uh start to break out even though it will be a breakout and then plateau and then break out again and the net of this is that we still don't know when we're going to see mainstream fsd but it's likely in the next two to five years and so eventually tesla's going to get there i think they're going to be one of the first ones there and i think this is going to prove to be an important part of the investment case and chalk this also in the category of patience is a virtue but they do have a good lead when it comes to the miles driven and the last piece is the bigger picture and when i think about the tesla investment case this margin is an important piece but it doesn't tell the whole story i think that the bigger story is the addressable market the car market is a big market depending on how many vehicles 70 to 85 million somewhere in that range this is a 2.1 to 2.6 trillion dollar a year market it puts it about four times as big as a smartphone market so this is something that you can build a huge business around and tesla next year is probably going to be about 130 billion in revenue and so there's just a massive opportunity for them to be a leader and to capitalize on what is an in inevitable shift from gas to electric it might take longer because we're having this lull in the consumer however it is uh something that is going to be inevitable that we're going to go to electrification so i think that is something that gets me excited is just the size of the electric addressable market and then on top of that eventually we're going to get to autonomy and that's going to unlock some value and the last piece of it i continue to believe traditional auto is in a tight spot and more recently we've seen some push pushouts from general motors this week talking about their orion all electric light truck manufacturing plant that are being pushed out for a year was supposed to be producing vehicles in 2024 they've now moved that to 2025 also gm postponed their analyst day their investor day from november for a full year uh they blamed the u uh the the talks for with the uwa as the reason for the push out but seems pretty aggressive to push it out for a full year i think it's a sign that these companies whether it's ford losing more money gm pushing out some of the production still trying to figure out what the path forward is with electrification not to mention some of the structural changes they need to make on their cost structure with labor and in terms of their dealer networks and how they optimize those so i still think this the cards are stacked in favor of tesla when you think about the bigger picture and yes this is a challenging pe period but the winds of change are still at tesla's back and i think they will capitalize on that in the years to come so on behalf of pressure points bonus version and deep waterer asset management i'm jean monster bye for now"
Pressure Points: Tesla Q4 Earnings,2024-01-25 01:22:19+00:00,10,qcTyHl99BVk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTyHl99BVk,[music] welcome to pressure points i'm jean monster our topic is apple earnings and we're going to cover four bases first is the guidance next we're going to talk about the active install base we're going to shift over to china and wrap up with talking about artificial intelligence so bringing it back to the top in terms of guidance the december outlook stung shares they were trading down about 1% in the aftermarket and then once the outlook was red shares traded down about 4% and so that delta specifically was commentary that called for revenue to be flat year-over-year previously estimates had expected that to be up 5% so call it a 5% guide down and the stock trades down 3% all seems to make sense and then luca gave some commentary that reminded us all that there are 13 weeks in this december quarter compared to 14 weeks a year ago and if you would normalize that that would imply that the business should be up 7% year-over-year this december and that would be above the streets previous expectations of 5% growth so the question comes down to it did the analysts know that there was 13 weeks in this quarter did they factor that in or not and i think the answer is that probably 80% of them factored that in and either way i think that trying to guess what percentage of the analyst factor that in is a little bit of a fool's errand because ultimately what matters is what's the business growing at and they made it clear that on a week uh to week basis so year-over-year looking at each week that as i mentioned the business is growing at 7% and so i actually think that the guidance is fine i think that it's understandable that there was this negative initial reaction but i think that investors will sift through that and get more comfortable as the days move forward the next topic is the active install base this is a metric that they've been making more clear and talking more about over the past year it continued to grow as expected it should grow it did continue to grow the last hard number we have was back in december of 2022 when they said it surpassed 2 billion my sense and grew at 8% back in december of 2022 they haven't given specifics since then but my sense is it's probably growing 2 to 3% year-over-year and that's important because that active install base is really the cornerstone of this shift in a thesis that apple is a consumer staple company as long as the company continues to grow its active install base revenue should be relatively reliable that's because that product flywheel that is that they consumers buy one apple product they fall love with it they turn around they buy a second apple product add services and continue to repeat that cycle that is at the substance of what a consumer staple company does and so that theme is intact which in my view uh justifies apple to have a higher multiple than the rest of big or or many of in the big tech category next topic is related to china going into the quarter there is some concern lots of concern around china in part because reports about bans within the government there was also a sense that um that huawei's new phones were gaining market share and last a surprise visit from tim cook in the month of october would make you think that there was some pr work that apple wanted to achieve in the region in the end china business was down 2% year-over-year there's no real hard estimates out there in terms of what consensus was related to that but as for some some context is that china over the past year has been up and down it was down 7% year-over-year in december 2022 down 3% in march up 8% in the most recent june quarter and now as i said down 2% so overall it's kind of in line with the variation that we've seen separately is they they talked about that the fx the currency piece had a particularly negative impact on the china business and on a currency basis that would have grown at 4% year-over-year so i don't like using uh currency as an excuse for companies when it works against them and not mentioning it of course when they it works for them we just want to call it like it is is currency has fluctuations generally you kind of rule it out but in the case of how much attention is paid on this china number it's worth noting what is going on on the ground in china and that business is growing and cook did mention that they are gaining share in china he talked about the broader smartphone market being down in china and so that seems to map loosely to how i've been thinking about it and so i think that the china business is intact and i think that they will uh continue i think that that positive trend will continue in the december quarter outside of the demand side there is this nagging question about manufacturing and what they're doing in terms of diversifying outside of china it didn't get a ton of attention on the call i think it's a major topic uh we estimate that there's 40 to 45% of apple's revenue is currently manufactured in china and that number is going to decline in the years to come the most likely area that that goes is of course india uh still a small part i believe about 2% of total manufacturing is done in india but that i think number could ramp meaningfully in the years to come and so uh that's china and we're going to end on a high note which of course is artificial intelligence it is a note that apple doesn't like talking about and they didn't bring it up in their prepared remarks and they haven't brought it up in their prepared remarks for the last nine months and so what surprises um that may be a surprise given all the attention that big tech is paying to ai but of course the topic came up in q& a and the question was what are you doing in terms of generative ai and tim cook's immediate uh response was explaining how ai is being embedded into their products really showing the benefits of their products and so he talked about things that they've talked about in the past about fall detection and photo management and uh the ekg things like that about how ai is making their products better he did did uh after reminding us of how they're using ai today did answer the question and said that they are going to be spending more in generative ai but they're going to do it responsibly and i decode that as uh they recognize that there's an opportunity in generative ai i think it ultimately presents itself in a product that is siri based and has an opportunity for them to really be a pioneer in personalized ai something that really doesn't exist today personalized ai is the idea of asking an agent aka siri alexa ask an agent to uh complete a task for you multi-layer task more than just compose an email or a powerpoint it would be something like a book a trip or you could ask how can i improve my credit score or um you know be able to organize a meeting for example ask to coordinate a meeting with multiple people people all of this is in the general category of personalized ai and an area that apple has a unique opportunity in because they have this brand around security and privacy and i think that that's going to be important as people open up their personalized ai to these models and so uh the uh the last piece on that uh tim cook's comment is related to doing it responsibly and i think this maps out to apple probably spending that billion dollars year in generative ai that mark german from bloomberg recently reported uh that is small compared to the call it 28 billion that apple's going to spend in r&d it's small compared to what microsoft google and amazon are saying that they're doing it but it also would imply a big step up and allow them to continue to protect these record high margins while investing in ai and as a just a quick cautionary tale is a good reminder is that throwing money at a tech problem doesn't always yield success and i think probably the best example of that is what meta has spent over the last several years in reality labs deep water is an investor in meta and we wish they wouldn't spend as much in reality labs that 15 billion that's a big number apple's approaching it very tim cook like in a judicious way and building those generative ai products don't know when they're coming out can't wait to see them and on that note i'm to wrap our episode of pressure points bye for now
DeepTech315: Tesla / FTC & AI / Semi's Earnings,2024-01-26 19:09:04+00:00,17,69pKINRopmg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69pKINRopmg,"[music] welcome to pressure points i'm jean mster our topic is microsoft earnings before we get into the pressure point just recap microsoft exceeded revenue by 1% and earnings by about 5% this is similar to google also reported the same time tonight they had exceeded top line by 1% and bottom line by 3% so microsoft is a little bit better as of recording microsoft shares are trading down a half a percent that is improvement from where they had bottomed out and after i was trading at down two and a half percent so shall an important move higher as they talked about their outlook and we'll jump into the pressure point and i'm going to read some comments from nadella's opening comment was he he says we've moved from talking about ai to applying ai to scaling it by infusing ai across every layer of our tech stack infusing ai across every layer of our tech stack from talking to infusing it that was where microsoft kicked off their call and that is the pressure point how is ai impacting their business and to really zoom in on that we got to break it down into three parts one is their cloud business second is office and third is profitability in terms of their cloud business azure specifically it's about 15% of revenue it grew at 30% in the december quarter expectations were for it to grow at 27.5% it grew at 29% in the september quarter so sequentially the growth rates increased by 100 basis point and that was a positive surprise when you put it in the context of what happened with google cloud google cloud accelerated their cloud business by 320 basis points in the december quarter so on a relative basis even though azure is growing faster off of a bigger number azure has 22% market share versus google cloud at 11 there's there i would give advantage to google when it comes to the war between the cloud wars at least for the december quarter but importantly the outlook for the march quarter when they got to the prepared outlook remarks was for azure growth to continue at that 30% rate which is remarkable given the law of large numbers i would have expected them to have guided close to 27% so a very favorable output impact and that is being driven by ai specifically they talked on the conference call that inference training or inference is the uh biggest impact in terms of where they're seeing the spend in azure and they mentioned that a third of the 53,000 customers are new to azure over the past year which is impressive and means that they added their customer base by increase it by 50% and revenue in the december quarter by 30% so so when you have a customer base that's growing faster than revenue that's usually a sign that you're going to have some sustainability and revenue growth over time because you add those new customers then they tend to grow over time so that's a positive sign about azure growth in the coming quarters and so outlook overall relative to ai's impact on azure is that customers are us it for inference they're adding a lot of customers and that means that the growth rate is continuing to remain elevated here the second topic related to how ai is impacting microsoft's business is with office and the uh specifically on the outlook commentary is that for the office uh to grow at uh to grow at 15% year-over year now taking a step back office accounts for call 22 23% of microsoft's overall revenue so this combined with cloud those two segments are call it 37% of revenue but are are some of the most uh focused uh segments by investors but back to the commentary is for 15% growth for office for the march quarter the street expectations were for closer to 12% so that's in the positive category when we think about the outlook and they also mentioned that uh well it's early days for microsoft 360 co- pilot this of course is powered by ai we're excited by the adoption we've seen to date and continue to expect revenue to grow over time so stop short of giving details but definitely stoked the optimism that that uh 365 co-pilots can have a positive impact on their office business and then the final piece is related to expenses and as they uh kind of brought it all together through the outlook commentary uh there was expectations they set expectations that that operating margin should improve one to two points in 2024 over 2023 which is again remarkable given the amount of investment that they're making in ai they're starting to actually see some cost improvements around that and uh some uptake and revenue from some of these co-pilot products but bringing it together and starting to see an improving margin this early in the ai cycle is going to get investors more optimistic that we're going to see even more margin improvement down the road so when you put all this together the positive outlook related to office and azure the positive commentary related to expenses i think you're going to get a situation where analysts generally went into the call thinking that they're going to grow revenue this year around 15% they'll probably leave this uh thinking that revenue is going to grow around 16% for calendar 24 and going into the call we're thinking that earnings were going to grow at around 16% and probably now leaving the call thinking earnings are going to grow at like 18% so very high level saw positive you're going to see positive revisions on microsoft in both the top line small but positive both the top line and the bottom line directly related to ai um on behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now"
Pressure Points: Google Q4 Earnings,2024-01-31 01:30:45+00:00,7,gZWKiUbNBzo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZWKiUbNBzo,[music] welcome to pressure points i'm jean mster from deep waterer asset management and our topic today is apple's initiatives and artificial intelligence before we jump into the pressure point i want to give some context related to what's in the investment community on apple more recently the share price has been moving up approaching this $200 level if you look at the performance since apple reported their last quarter the shares are up 12% that's basically in line with the nasdaq that's up 11 % and a little bit better than the other six of the mag s which are up 8% during that time so there's been some outperformance relative to some of the other mega cap recently i believe the reason why the shares have been moving higher is investors are better understanding what the company's guidance was six weeks ago for the december quarter specifically to think about the number of weeks in the quarter 13 versus 14 and on a likeforlike basis the business is basically tracking up 7% which is a pos positive re acceleration because it was down just about 1% in the september quarter so i think more optimism around revenue growth and that comes from just strengthen the iphone and also services separately there's this growing expectation that margins are going to be continuing to improve last quarter they hit a record at 45.2% that was for the september quarter if you go back and look at the for fiscal 2022 was about 43% so a couple uh lower and they expanded margins despite the fact that revenue was down in fiscal 23 by 3% which is a difficult thing to do and i think testimony to what they're doing with silicon and how that is improving margins and so as part of this expectation that things continue to improve uh but that's the setup now we're going to shift to the pressure point which is apple and artificial intelligence and to date apple has been pretty steady in their messaging around ai they don't like to use the word they rarely mention ai when it does come up they remind investors that how they've been addressing the opportunity is they're putting a lot of ai inside their products it can be everything from facial recognition to how recommendations are with music to uh what they're doing on photos and organization on photos fall detection with the watch and everything in terms of the user interface with vision pro so they're clear the device the experience they want to talk about the experience and not about the kind of bits and bites of the technology behind it that is textbook how apple approaches their products and their user experience for example the ipod was never about how many gigabytes an ipod was it was about a thousand songs in your pocket and really communicating products in terms of how the customer can benefit from it and so they've done that so far when it comes to ai and talking about the benefits to the customer customer but of course the exciting part of ai has been on generative ai over the past year and apple hasn't said much the topic did come up in the q&a on their september earnings call and tim cook uh mentioned that in terms of ai quote we obviously have work going on and you can bet we're investing quite a bit and we're going to invest responsibly the takeaway from that comment is that apple is investing in this and they want to do more when it comes to ai some of that's going to be with devices but i suspect in 2024 we're going to hear more from apple integrating generative ai into some of their offerings the most obvious place who i think we'll see it is something related to siri today siri is good but i wouldn't say she he is great and ultimately i think that there's an opportunity to build more j of ai into siri results that could be an opportunity to help people find things it could be an opportunity for search like commerce and just an opportunity where people use the product more and kind of get that flywheel of the ecosystem of apple devices going even faster fall more in love with siri therefore you want to keep your iphone type of a approach but the basic idea is i do think that they will add some generative features to siri in 2024 i think that those features will be built off someone else's open foundation model something like meta's llama that one it's kind of hard for me to see come together just given the rift between the companies but the basic idea is foundation models are difficult to build it's not about throwing money at it it's about time and data apple has a lot of data but these models training just take a lot of humans and in the loop initially to get them off the ground and i just don't think that they have enough progress when it comes to a foundation model to release it in 2024 so i suspect that they'll be adding features uh and and talking more about about those but it's not going to be based on their foundation model and as far as the impact to apple's business initially they're probably not going to make a lot of money off this this is going to be something where again it benefits the user i could see that allowing some of the developers access to this level will create apps that are more robust that they can charge more that the app store can make some more money on but initially i i see it as more of front and center people know that apple's doing more in generative ai but not as much of a money maker down the road call it three plus years down the road as they advance i can see an opportunity for them to have a pro version of siri that could potentially help with as a personal assistant i think that's a unique opportunity that apple can do when it comes to ai book me a trip on a flight from my family to las vegas and just have the whole experience be taken care of huge opportunity for apple it's not going to be over the next few years but i think we're going to start to see evidence that they're moving in that direction next year i do believe that as i mentioned eventually that they do start to build their own foundation model it may take three to five years i do think that it's important that they have control of their own foundation model and so it takes time but call that a 2028 type of a a time frame so in the meantime um as we start to build on some of these gen of experiences we're also going to be hearing more of course about apple and their hardware when it comes to ai and allowing their devices just to work better when ai is run on device and apple's done a good job of that with their own silicon but undoubtedly we're going to hear more about that with every product that comes out similar to what we've heard from apple over the past year when you put it together apple has been slow to acknowledge what they've been doing in ai i think 2024 is the year where they start to show a little bit more when it comes to generative ai specifically built in the siri and starts to lay the groundwork for the company to embrace uh the opportunities to do more personal ai longer term a unique position that only apple can do topic that is going to obviously keep our focus and attention and so there'll be more pressure points on this uh event uh but on behalf of deep water and pressure points i'm jean bye for now
Pressure Points: Microsoft Q2 Earnings,2024-01-31 01:47:21+00:00,7,1rJ-aBe_7W0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rJ-aBe_7W0,"welcome to this week's deep tech 315 that's doug i am jean our three topics are sam alman and the 7even trillion doll push to improve the availability of chips for ai second we're going to talk about meta and what zuckerberg is talking about relative to quest 3 and its position against apple and vision pro and last we're g to wrap with uh doug's intelligent alpha this is his ai picking portfolio manager always fun to see the update there and you would definitely want to stay tuned for that see how ai is doing machine versus human so we'll take it back to the top uh the story was out maybe feels like a week or so ago but it just keeps uh rearing its head just given the the raw magnitude but essentially sam alman was presenting where was he like in saudi arabia or something like that or dubai and talking about the opportunity for really chang changing the whole world's chip uh production process and talked about this 5 to7 trillion doll in investment and to put that in a perspect to the wall street journal recently reported that life humanity to date in the chip design and build out has been about a trillion dollars so he's talking about a five to 7x order of magnitude versus the past call it 40 50 years and u my take was he actually doesn't mean to seven billion what he really means is that we need to have better chip production and maybe it's a trillion but he's putting the stake in the ground that there needs to be some improvements around chips for ai i would never take sam mman uh at not his word he probably does mean 5 to seven trillion i think if he could find a way to raise that uh he would find a way to deploy it i i do think though when you think about 5 to s trillion there's there's two kinds of numbers that get reported there there's actual numbers you know there's fundraising numbers like when a company raises a $100 million for their you know d at a billion dollar post valuation and then there's uh government style numbers where they say we're going to save a trillion dollars but if you look at the asterisks it's like trillion dollars over 25 years you do the math and oh got suddenly not quite as exciting and i think that's probably the reality of this if someone says we're going to find a way to fund you5 trillion dollar sam mman um i doubt it would be that they just cut him a track check for five trilli you'd have to have a lot of money a lot of liquidity to be able to do that i think it would be a trunch thing probably over a decade but even then you're still talking about investing 500 billion dollars maybe over a seven or 10 year period it's still a huge number and if you put that into perspective you know tsmc they're going to invest somewhere around 40 or50 billion dollar to build their fabs in arizona so if you get 500 billion a year maybe that's like 10 fabs that you could spin up to try to put it into some kind of context you still don't have the institutional knowledge so there's i think there is still a bottleneck and there's always a bottleneck in every process if you had the capital that's the thing that's really hard is how do you get the people then to be able to helm the fabs and at deep water we're investors in tsmc and that's one of the reasons why we feel good about that investment is the human capital the engineer and i think that's one of the challenges that you can throw money at things but to actually build humans as i think about that human piece i think i wonder if could ai actually help solve some of these management of these incredibly complex fabs could ai kind of help automate that and kind of get us through this this human knowledge bottleneck to pay the road for that future that alman's talking about probably over time i would say though that again you're you're going to have a time issue there too in terms of how quickly could an ai be ready to do that and the answer is it's probably i would still guess years away you need to get something toward i've called it infinite intelligence i'm not not really looking forward to you know the super intelligence thing i don't think you need that but i think you do need ironically uh almost widescale massive compute availability to be able to handle having a machine learn to do complex tasks like that and so when i break it down you know forget about the number for a minute i think what alman is saying and probably to your prior point jean is we need to invest a lot more money in ships because if we are going to deliver on this ai future that we're talking about it's going to happen because we have the compute power necessary to do it and we just don't have enough power right now that's what he say agree with that it also reminds me how strong nvidia's businesses they're going to be reporting next week and really they are largely untouched 85% plus market share of the gpu market uh perhaps over the next decade that will change uh we jump to our second topic which is zuckerberg i i just love this about him comes out swinging and puts this video out it's a short video three and a half minute video where he's basically building the argument that that the quest three which is call it $500 is actually a better hardware product than the vision pro at $3,500 so a 7x difference and i think he brings up some he does bring up some really valid points around some of the decisions they've made to keep the the weight light it's lighter than vision pro and as i've used it that was one of my big issues is it just felt he heavy vision pro felt heavy uh so i thought that was a good point he also gave credit to apple around the the ey tracking which i think is incredible and he said they're going to bring that back and kind of the biggest picture he painted was the concept that they're going to be the open source and apple's going to be the closed source and that that resonated with me too but in the back of my mind there there was this conversation that was playing there's the piece about wartime ceo we can discuss that doug but there's also the piece around is this the right place for meta to be investing1 15 billion dollars a year and so the wartime piece i love that he's definitely has that edge to him well i think it's also uh um worth remembering that apple has had some harsh criticism for meta in their business the last couple of years i mean this whole issue with idfa and tracking i mean apple has kind of called out meta and said we don't think advertising is a noble business to some extent i mean i'm paraphrasing but i i think it's important for us to remember these companies aren't exactly on the friendliest terms yeah this is defines bad blood in big tech yeah and and zuckerberg is not starting something with this this is a continuation of the bad blood um i've used the uh the vision pro now i have it uh we've had one at deep water we've kind of been sharing around i haven't used a quest 3 yet so i couldn't have an objective comparison but to your point like it is heavy um i wouldn't pay $3,500 for it is my my quick answer and there's not a killer use case for that product i doubt there's a killer use case for the quest product either when we think about investing billions of dollars both of these companies in this in this product line they're both investing billions they need to figure out a killer use case i mean that that has been the knock on vr and it continues to be in my view even with spal computing coming up so we've looked at some of those numbers and in zuckerberg's quick video he talked he mentioned three times gaming he talked about fitness to apple stays clear they don't mention gaming very rarely mention gaming apple announced with six 00 apps at launch and those are 600 apps that are optim that are made for vision pro versus the million plus apps that are basically ipad apps that are converted over forget those those don't count but of those 600 we counted 42% we're gaming related versus 72% were gaming related on quest platform and so as i as i saw this i was excited as meta investors like they're spending a lot of money and and maybe they can get to that be that 80% uh option or that 80% of the market when it comes to metaverse spatial computing but then there was this also like nagging thing he's still talking about gaming they really don't have that many apps three years into it 560 apps it's like show me the money like it's just not there which gets us back to i think these devices are making a lot of progress but they still are need of an application where people are excited about them they both are and i think what you just described to me says that it's really going to be on meta and it's going to be on apple to figure out that app i don't think they're ever going to foster the developer ecosystem because they don't have the users i mean you need to have tens of millions of users probably to be a viable device for someone to want to build something on so they can actually make money and fund the business um and so for now the foreseeable future i think both apple and meta need to figure out what can we build what can we build that's just so compelling people can't they can't get away from it they need to keep coming back and then they have to buy this device um because it's so good and neither of them have figured it out yet i do think apple has an advantage relative to the developer community versus meta maybe that changes with llama over time um and i can say vision pro still is searching for that killer use case i have been capturing more than half of my videos that after using vision pro i'm capturing in off my phone i'm using in spatial because it's not the reason to go out and spend $3,500 but for those who have kind of experienced a little bit of that spatial video it's i think it's pretty fun so we're going to jump to the last topic which is intelligent alpha if you have not been following doug in his dlo you got to get on track with this because it is uh compelling you had a comment this week i laughed out loud when i read it you said ai is a 50 legged man in an ass-kicking competition it's doing really well uh let us get frame it in how well are those ai strategies that you're doing with intelligent outfit doing relative to the benchmarks yeah the the ass kicking contest the hat tip to charlie merer rip he always had these phrases about uh if he didn't really study if you didn't get curious and really do your work you were like a one-legged man in an ass kicking contest so with ai what i've found what i've learned just experimenting with generative ai using gpt using gemini to build stock portfolios it just has so many advantages over humans uh especially that they're not human they don't have emotions that they deal with what that's translated into there's 15 course strategies that i track 12 of them right now are outperforming their benchmarks since inception average run of these is about five and a half months some of the longest strategies i've been tracking for about seven months um and the average strategy is beating its benchmark by over 400 basis points at this point so pretty good amount of outperformance in just half of a year and i mean it's uh crazy outperformance i would say and from our perspective we still want to keep testing these and like what's the amount of testing before we can you know put more money behind these strategies i mean is it a year is it is it nine months i mean how do we know when we've kind of broken through that that threshold of testing i think we're already there in my opinion i mean it deep water there's two of them that we're running live with partner capital now uh and those are both performing well one is a large cap focused uh tech strategy so it's 12 tech stocks high conviction competes against the qqq and since inception that strategy has beat the qqq by it's almost an unbelievable number but 1,600 basis points 16 percentage points and the qqq has done great um so if you if you've wanted to be concentrated in large cap tech which is exactly what the ai is doing in this strategy you've been in the right place and then the other strategy that we're testing with real money is a long short strategy inspired by uh julian robertson old school tiger one of the originators in the hedge fund world um you basically buy the best companies go long the best and you short the worst that's what he used to always say that was his simple strategy and that has been great as well it's outperforming its benchmark by almost 300 basis points and by the way it was short craft hines uh which just reported today stock was down 6% last time i checked uh it has been nailing shorts more recently this quarter it's had a great short book had boeing too been it had boeing it had mobile eye uh it had a handful of really good ones um so far so i think it's it's getting better what what excites me the most when you ask about like how how do we know that we've tested enough um i actually see it i can see it because i'm looking at it almost every day kind of getting better and smarter over time as it makes these picks like some of the picks make more sense to me in the beginning some of it it's like man i would never put that in there and sometimes i'm wrong to think i'd never put that in there but i can see the intelligence sort of evolving in my opinion at least and also my ability to use the the ai i think is evolving like i'm understanding how they think and there's a little bit of a symbiotic process i think between you know the human that i still think is ultimately the kernel of inspiration for generative ai you need that component and then the intelligence that the ai is actually harnessing to you know do whatever it's asked to do including pick stocks power of being unemotional uh power of the d lo make sure you check that out and check us out next week on our next episode on behalf of doug and jean bye for now"
Frontier & Center: AMD,2024-01-31 18:55:09+00:00,6,_jstMRNOC48,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jstMRNOC48,welcome to pressure points i'm jean mster from deep waterer asset management and our topic today is the inflation numbers for the month of november and their impact on both mega cap and sub 50 billion market cap tech stocks in terms of the numbers for the month of november the headline uh cpi number was up 3.1% as in line with expectations and down from 3.2% in the month of october the core number which excludes the food and energy was unchanged uh from the month of october at 4% and also in line with expectations and so that slight decline in the headline number was because energy has come down but the better focus is the core number which is steady or stubborn depending on your perspective either way is that i think that the commentary from the fed is going to be that they're going to have to keep rates higher uh for longer and what that four longer is is most investors think that we're going to start to see some rate cuts in the middle of next year and the four longer piece would suggest it's mid to late next year before we start to see some rate cuts and so that's the setup we're going to get to the pressure point here and that is what is this all mean for tech stocks from the highest level is the mag 7 has done well in part because of flight to quality flight to safety but also because of this interest rate environment which has created a dyam damic where investors don't want to be owning some of these sub 50 billion market cap companies because they got slammed so hard when interest rates went up and the reason why they got hit so hard was because of course these smaller companies have earnings that are further out and higher interest rates means that the discount number is a little bit higher which has a more significant impact on share price so they're just simply more sensitive to rate changes but my sense and this is the the punchline of the pressure point point is that i think even a steady rate environment not even needing the rate cuts is going to be favorable for those sub 50 billion market cap companies it may not be in the first few trading days after this cpi number comes out or when the fed has commentary but i believe in the months ahead is that just having rates remain stable allows investors to more seriously think about uh investing in some of these companies that have been largely forgotten about over the past couple years and these are not necessarily small companies again sub 50 billion market caps and so i believe that we're going to see a a slight shift over the next six months to performance coming from some of these kind of midcap uh smaller and midcap companies a little bit less coming from the magnificent 7 they'll still do well but i think the kind of the the the strength in the market is going to come from some of these companies because the environment is going to remain stable interest rate environment remaining stable so that's the pressure point uh stable is good for some of these smaller tech companies and on behalf of deep water i'm jean bye for now
Pressure Points: Apple Preview,2024-01-31 21:35:21+00:00,16,_cTSXYQrEfk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cTSXYQrEfk,"welcome to deep tech 315 that's doug i'm jean our three topics today are double apple downgrade something pretty rare second is perplexity a new search engine jeff bezos is an investor in it and last we're going to talk about intelligent alpha if you haven't heard of it uh you haven't been on our episodes in the past this is one of doug's favorite topics he's uh knees hands uh deep into ai as an investing vehicle and so we'll jump back to the top uh doug uh we've known apple as analysts we covered apple as investors uh we closely follow apple and it is rare that you get uh two downgrades in two days before they report a quarter and my sense just as some backdrop for those who haven't been following along is that barkley's and piper have downgraded apple right in the new year and the stocks down call it 6% in the last couple days nasdaq's down probably two two and a half percent something like that so a rare kind of underperformance not as rare as you would think i went and looked back over the past year apple hasn't had that double downgrade but the stock has traded down by a range of six to 11% in four other periods over the last 12 months so these pullbacks are common but again it's the double downgrade that got us to the top of deep tech this week and if you're curious the reasons for the downgrade both analysts talked about weakness in china talked about uh difficult product sales uh talked about difficult comps and talked about valuation and i gotta say is that i respect analysts uh stepping out in front of a quarter making a gutsy call on a stock that's generally loved by the street that i definitely respect but when i look at the substance of the reasons for the downgrade it didn't feel like there was um much um much uh much substance to it uh specifically is that this idea of soft iphone sales in china i mean that's been a narrative around this for for a long time it feels like to me that they've seen the stock run up by 55% think that 2024 is not going to be a great year so they wanted to pull their chips off the table i think that's about as simple as you could put it it just feel like downgrades on valuation largely i mean i don't think there's anything uh overly concerning about apple in terms of the business to be shocked could they have some softness around iphone could the 16 be a weaker upgrade cycle those things are certainly possible but i think sometimes i think when you're an analyst and like you said we live that world there's always pressure to do something there's there's pressure to make calls you know you you got to pick stocks that you favor more and favor least and i think you look at the mag 7 a lot of them have run you look at companies like google and meta that we own they have cheaper uh multiples they may have more promising growth prospects in the nearer term and i think sometimes you just have to look at that that universe and say well you know maybe apple is for now the low mano and the totem pole when you're making that kind of call i don't think that that means that anything's wrong with the company or the business though toally agree i think one piece that is uh missing here is what i think the opportunity that apple has to talk more about their foundation model we've previewed this in the past we expect at wwdc this year them to talk more about ajax and bring siri in the generative ai within apple and then of course could be weeks away could be a couple months away vision pro they're not going to sell many units this year we're talking 500,000 uh probably at the most and but i think it's it's going to give uh investors and consumers a chance and developers probably most importantly a chance to get a sense about what app's trying to accomplish there and kind of build those groundwork so i think innovation is alive and well at apple despite i think commentary that the iphone is getting tired yes the iphone is getting tired but there are exciting things that they can get into uh as we talked about around ai and spatial computing and and don't forget about automotive i think that still is a topic orbiting around there uh let's jump into our second topic which is perplexity for those of you who are not familiar this is a new search engine that is using ai and been perceived as a competitor to google they've raised about $75 million about a $550 million valuation and i guess in the grand scheme of everything that's going on in ai those are kind of reasonable i i guess valuations but it did catch my attention we see a lot of ai with our private companies and most of them are raising three five1 million uh this is feels like there's a little bit more momentum behind this well it's about a year old they have uh a few million users i believe on a monthly basis and so there's some real usage here i would i would take the other side of what you just said like i don't think this is a very big raise at all given what they're doing you look more broadly at some of these bigger promising ai plays particularly ones that are building foundation models and that might be the difference you know some of these foundation model oriented companies i think the minimum bar for them is to raise a few hundred million dollars to be able to build out the model now perplexity uses open ai gpt they build on top of that so they're not necessarily trying to build their own foundation model um they're trying to build what i would say i don't even know if i would agree with the characterization of it as a search engine i've used it i've used it for a long time now the benefit of perplexity is that it gives you citations about why it is giving you the answer it gives you right chat gbt doesn't do that bar doesn't do that anthropic doesn't do that and so it is a new feature and it's novel um i think that the question is okay if if they are going to be a better source for a single answer instead of 10 blue links that's great um but google doesn't make money just giving answers about general knowledge what's the play on commerce because that's where google makes money and i think that's what gets lost sometimes when we talk about killing google we always want to kill google you gotta factor in how does it impact commerce not just q&a right and there's a a recap if you think about google the breath of their search the biggest piece is information related that's called about half of it you get about uh 25 35% of it is related to commerce and the rest is related to navigation and so yeah that that commerce piece is a a huge piece to it when i've played around with perplexity and done commerce it it's just not built for that today like you said it's they're just not there and when i think about that and just the the habit of of google and we're we own google uh the the how habitual uh our use of google is i i think about on the advertising side the infrastructure that they've built around monetizing those ads and i think that that is a defensibility that google has that i think that's what you're saying is that there's there's more defensibility around google because it's hard to build an ad business it's hard to build an ad business it's hard to build the distribution that they have i mean billions of people that use chrome or android or youtube then they're not going to stop using those products um even if they start using something like a perplexity and so you know google just they have their tentacles kind of everywhere that's one of the really powerful things that they've built over the last 20 years um i think that's hard and then on top of it to your point they have you know an ad machine uh they have a sales group right they have reliable metrics they can deliver to clients and value roi they can deliver to clients that clients want um and so i think that's a big thing the other thing though i i would point out that perplexity is doing that i think is interesting is they like chat pt and like anthropic with claud now have a subscription mechanism to make money i don't think that every ai platform is going to ultimately monetize that way but it is notable that we're seeing that become pretty widespread so you can uh subscribe to perplexity for $20 a month i think you get sort of like unlimited uh uh query uh access essentially um and so they make think the wall street journal article said5 to10 million a year on that you do the math they've got tens of thousands of subscribers right now most of the world doesn't know about it they might be able to build a pretty big business just through paid subs if they can continue to deliver that experience of having sort of well sourced uh and well-sited answers that people want immediately my thought goes to what if google would start to charge more obviously google has paid offerings today around youtube and uh but if they would do something around search i mean it just feels at the core like there'd be something that is just uh like almost unethical for google to charge for search but i would pay for if if they somehow cheered search and if it was a few dollars a month i pay i think my i just i saw my prime uh to get ads free prime at the end of this month i got to pay an extra $ 299 a month for that and so uh i think that yeah paying $3 a month for google i mean that would be uh the stock would just take off on that would you think maybe i think uh three bucks a month is what $36 a year how many millions of people would really do that even if a hundred million people did that just to put it in into perspective if you're only talking about $4 billion doar in revenue doesn't really move the needle for google that's how big they are which i think is really hard to conceptualized um but i don't i wouldn't be surprised if they did try something in the paid realm i mean they've tried different things paid with youtube uh they have adree youtube obviously they've got youtube tv and so it's not like they're allergic to doing uh paid things and i would also note i actually just was uh was doing some research on buu recently the google of china they have an 8 subscription a month that they just launched for their ernie bot which is essentially their version of chat gpt so they're doing it everywhere every ai company it seems like but google has a a way to pay them um yeah want uh let's say quick i just want to do those numbers on that again let's say so google has about a billion and a half monthly active users something that's not about right for search and that's probably right it might be higher than that it's probably low get a 100 million at $35 a year yeah i guess yeah that's uh three and a half billion three and a half billion per per month no per year if you're paying you said 299 a month 36 bucks a year that's right 35 times 100 that's right i got it i'm back makes a ton of sense um and an opportunity definitely available for google another opportunity available for investors if we get to our third and final topic is related to investing along with ai you've just been all over this dog and this intelligent alpha uh you know in our weekly meetings are are we do a a recap with all of our different product groups we do private public we have individual meetings we have a group team meeting on mondays and fridays but doug you've just been talking a lot about this a lot of the work for those who haven't been following your work uh maybe give a recap of what you're doing how can they follow along and why are you so excited about this in the past summer in 2023 i started to experiment with ai uh specifically starting with chat gpt just to see if it could beat the s&p 500 and uh that simple initial experiment has now turned into about 40 uh separate strategies where i use chat gpt uh google bard now really gemini and uh anthropics claude as sort of an intelligent investment committee to do stock picking and create portfolios we're running two of those portfolios live at deep water with partner capital um and the bottom line is the the portfolios have been doing way better than i expected 83% of the portfolios as of the end of 2023 were beating their benchmarks in some cases they were beating benchmarks by over portfolios you're running uh there's 40 total strategies a little over 40 uh there's 16 core ones that are you know like i would say like a large cap us equities right midcap us equities things that are kind of the big uh ets that people tend to invest in in the us and is of the the 83% off performance is that in the 16 or the 40 that's in the 40 in the 16 it's almost 100% actually uh there was one of the 16 that was neck and neck with their benchmark but every other one of the 16 core was ahead of its benchmark that's awesome and then as as we keep experimenting i'm getting a lot of inbounds from people asking how they can invest in this and we don't have it available right now still doing continuing testing and we keep pushing doug let's see if we can find a way to get this to the market and how do you think just about timing of getting a product that's available uh i think that sometime this year hopefully we see more availability of something like this i think this is going to be a year for ai stock picking to kind of show that it is ready for prime time and one of my thesis is uh that ai you know it's it's like in the iphone 1 or iphone 3g state right now and it will be an iphone 15 faster than the iphone went from the iphone 3g to the iphone 15 um if you think about how fast this thing and how much capability it's going to add i think this going to be a huge year for ai and that's only going to make these tools better at picking stocks and so the answer to your question is you know we've we've looked at ways to make this available able we're working on ways to make this potentially available i do think this is going to be a big part of the future of asset management and hopefully we see that come to fruition later this year for those of you who've been following doug and i for a long time you may have heard me reference him as not only the smartest guy that i know but the strongest guy if you follow him on twitter or his it's uh the dlo check that out i think you were doing a i don't i don't lift weights but uh is it a 300 or 450 pound deadlift uh and you are tr 500 okay i don't want to sell you short here the bar actually bends when he's picking up now doug doesn't talk about this stuff of course we find about it and then it becomes some good chatter in the office here at deep water uh i just love that there is no smarter and stronger man than doug clinton check out his d lo and check out our next episode of deep tech 315 on behalf of doug and jean bye for now"
Pressure Points: Apple Q1 Earnings,2024-02-02 00:50:30+00:00,12,1P9h68p7UKk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1P9h68p7UKk,welcome to pressure points i'm jean mster from deepwater asset management and our pressure point topic tonight is google and microsoft earnings we're going to do a combo platter because there are two companies we get two pressure points tonight it's about cloud growth and about margins and just as a point of reference here as of this recording shares of google are down about six% after hours and microsoft shares are up about 4% after hours the earning so we'll jump right into it as i mentioned the key pressure point the first one is related to cloud google's cloud business was expected to grow about 25% in the quarter that's down from 28% to the june quarter in fact it missed that 25% growth and came in at 23% if you're curious the operating margin on that business is about 3% and they have about uh 10% share of cloud so that's google cloud in a nutshell a slight disappointment and that obviously is a pressure point because the cloud business represents one way that these companies can make a lot of money from ai and so more ai that's done these developers need to go to the the cloud and the big hyperscalers amazon azure and google are going to benefit from it so that's google cloud i'm going to jump down and put that in context to what happened with azure they have about 22% global market share of cloud that business accelerated growth went from 26% in june up to 29% in the september quarter margins had continued to rise which is amazing their operating margins on that business are about 40% and i mentioned where googles were at about 3% so as investors think about this there's essentially a a narrative that's coming together and microsoft was really clear on the call of this is that they have these ai tools this ai stack that's already in place that they're essenti usually grabbing usage as companies and small businesses are building ai applications they're gravitating to azure because it's all tied neatly together to use those products google on the flip side is hasn't rolled out their real competitor to open ai and some of the language models that microsoft uses that new product that new platform from google is coming out this quarter and it's called gemini and then next year they're going to come out with a lot of other models that they're going to add to google cloud and so the optimistic view of google is that they're going to start to catch up once they start to compete more on a level playing field and the optimistic view on microsoft is every week matters and they're continuing to get a lead here azure is so the piece related to microsoft's outlook for azure was to expect consistent growth at uh essentially the growth rate was 29% step down a couple percent in this december quarter to 26 27 and they said to uh that we should uh model that that's going to remain constant for the year as far as the growth for google they don't give explicit guidance but they were suggesting that their growth rate should be more stable at that 23% which suggests that google's probably going to be losing a little bit of share in cloud going forward so that's the tale of pressure point number one the cloud will shift to pressure point number two which is margins and of course you can't build a big ai hyperscale company like google and microsoft without investing a lot of money both of those companies are going to be doing it and surprisingly both had a similar message in the case of google cfo ruth parat mentioned that they'll be increasing their capex investment or their investments uh just to build everything that we're talking about but they uh see that their uh that the revenue growth is going to exceed expense growth and so that was a code for possibly margins coming down by a little bit revenue growth exceeding revenue growth exceeding expense growth in the case of amy hood from microsoft when she commented on that topic the same language we're going to be investing a lot in this this is really important for us ai build the infrastructure out and we're going to maintain margins which is a relief to investors that they can make these massive amounts of investments and maintain margin so a little bit more soft on ruth pat from google's language around that both of them are basically saying that they're going to continue to benefit from this goes uh uh continue to benefit or maintain more or less maintain profitability last uh this isn't a pressure point but i just will add relative to google and their uh their other business that being their search business massive business and they talked of that grew about 10% from about a 7% growth in the previous quarter their ad advertising business and i think that's a sign that the overall consumer is healthy so i do believe google is a barometer i was surprised to see shares of meta trade down a little bit on that meta reports tomorrow and i would expect them to have relatively upbeat commentary on advertising so that was a bright star relative to google microsoft really doesn't play into that so those are our two pressure points for this earnings night on google and microsoft behalf and on behalf of deep water and pressure points i'm jean bye for now
Pressure Points: Meta Q4 Earnings,2024-02-02 01:20:54+00:00,7,cfLP62Y6WLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfLP62Y6WLQ,welcome to deep tech 315 our first topic is nvidia this uh stock has obviously been a monster if you've been asleep here for the last month and woke up today the stock is up about 30% over the past month that compares the nasdaq which is up around 5% apple's up kind of eight% but the rest of the mag 7 is kind of in that uh three to 5% range more or less and so we have this just sp spectacular feels like the top is kind of getting ready to blow off uh nvidia felt like that three months ago six months ago a year ago there wasn't any new news here we had their product announcements as did amd and intel at this taiwanese conference we had some uh you know the earnings uh that went well and uh we have xci raising some money that they've talked about spending those on nvidia chips and elon saying that some of their fsd and austin's not ready to take these chips so i'm going to redirect them to xai so nvidia's constantly in the news but uh what's going on to all these pieces really don't uh seem to add up to this breakout unless it's just about the bigger picture i think it is about the bigger picture and you know you think of booms like this technologically driven boom booms and we have a recent one with the internet so it's kind of fresh still in a lot of people's minds where you say look at what happened to cisco you know same thing stock went vertical into the internet build and then just crashed down because it couldn't keep up its momentum and what i haven't heard a lot of people say even though we hear that comparison a lot i haven't heard a lot of people ask the question well what is the demand for incremental intelligence in the world what do you mean by that demand for incremental just like progress inching towards artificial general intelligence if if we've created intelligence through machines which we are whether we say it's artificial general which is equivalent to humans not equivalent to humans i actually think that's sort of irrelevant that's sort of this nuance that doesn't matter have we created intelligence that can create value in the world build value in the world what is the demand for incremental intelligence in the world i think the demand for it is probably really high and the point that i try to make is instead of saying well look at what happened with cisco look at what happened with the internet there was this overbuild i think the the better question is well what if ai is as profound as so many of us think it will be why wouldn't the company that is literally creating the brains for the intelligence right be one of if not the most valuable company in the world isn't isn't that kind of logical it's logical and i'm a fan of what nvidia is done what they're doing i believe in their competitive advantage manage and their remotes and so it's all that's logical i think it begs the question of the boom and the bust i mean this is a year ago in their april quarter nvidia's business was down 133% and since then it's kind of running at a 250% clip and so uh to answer your question i i think it's everyone agrees this is going to be great i think everyone would agree that the incremental intelligence piece is there's no way to satisfy that humans will always want more intelligence and i think the question comes down to is is there just going to be like a second derivative that kicks in here where you go from 30% growth to 20% to 15 off of some huge numbers and it just isn't as exciting of a story yeah well i want to frame that in too because i think that that's that's an important point and there's there's two angles to it that i think about one is right now i just looked at it this morning nvidia trades 33 times forward earnings so it's actually the second most expensive of the mag 7 for mag it's probably going to grow this is on 25 numbers numbers so it has whatever consensus growth is built in there and maybe consensus is still short but let's just say that that's right it's 33 times um you know apple is high 20s microsoft is 31 amazon's a little under 40 so amazon is still more expensive than nvidia on that metric and amazon has always been one that's traded at a very high earnings multile but when you put it in that context that doesn't seem that crazy and when i think about it even further and this is not meant to be a needle at apple but apple hasn't really grown topline that much the last couple of years and it sustained you know about a 30 times forward multiple so i kind of would ask okay fine let's say nvidia flatlines in a year or two right do we think the multiple goes back to 20 i don't think it probably does i don't think that would make sense probably not and the other thing i would say just about multiples and this was actually surprising to me if you look at that forward multiple 33 for nvidia right now uh it is cheaper than uber it's cheaper than paler it's cheaper than amazon it's cheaper than cco it's cheaper than chipotle there's a lot of companies that trade at a much higher multiple than nvidia does and that doesn't mean that they can keep up his growth i'm not saying that that's possible but i am saying that look out at some of these other companies in the market maybe they're drastically overvalued too that's fair but i think to just look at nvidia in a vacuum and say wow this thing's crazy look at the chart it's a hockey stick the multiples going up that's not fair in the context of a lot of these other companies who don't have the ai catalyst that nvidia does it just comes down to the question of higher longer if it they ultimately end up growing faster because that's the reason the reason why this incredible company trades at those surprisingly low valuations is that there's a lot of scar tissue around this for inv investors who have been around this for a long time that have a lot of dough to put into this company and they have a concern that something's going to slow if they didn't have that concern this would be trading at a 60 multiple and so i think that uh that really i mean that's the magic of investing is uh is this going to grow faster than what people think so we're going to jump to our second topic which is our final preview on wwdc i'll just kind of sum up where most people are gravitating towards is that the big announcement is related to siri uh this also a potential partnership likely partnership with open ai it could be google and gemini but essentially covering a lot of lost ground that they've had over the past few years and really injecting ai throughout their products in a short amount of time and then as part of that just kind of bringing both the mac os proba the biggest update in the mac os in like 40 years going from really hasn't changed much from the mouse on on desktop and this adding ai to it and of course adding ai to ios and so kind of uh putting all this together my sense was the biggest news is siri and that may seem like a surprise but siri is going to be the window that i think a lot of people are going to experience generative ai through and apple has this kind of unique angle by having all these devices that even though people are scarred about using siri it just feels like an opportunity for people to try it again and and um just uh get a new fresh look to using generative ai and i'd be curious what was your kind of that's my pressure point i love pressure points that's my pressure point going into this what's siri gonna look like i'm curious what's your what are you focused on i think that's the right thing too and i think it's it's expectations management you know i i think that we will get a step forward for apple and what they're doing with ai i mean anything is a step forward because they've been so quiet about it so far but i don't expect a revolutionary product announcement i think if that is the bar then things might be disappointing the wild card to me though by way let me stop let me pause you there yeah the stock's up 8% in the last month i mentioned what the nasdaq's done call it up 5% is is your sense that the market's actually looking for some sort of a breakthrough or just essentially integrating all the goodness that we've heard about over the past year and a half i think it's probably more of the ladder and i think that stock move part of it i think was apple was probably unfairly beaten up maybe relative to some of the other mega caps in in the space i mean obviously i think even with that 8% move i think apple's still on kind of the bottom in terms of year-to-date performance for for the megas um so i think part of it probably a little bit of reversion to the mean too but but what i was going to say about siri you made the point that there's scar tissue there and i actually wonder wildcard you know do they change the siri brand do they move away from siri because i think so many people have this negative like i have a negative connotation with siri when siri starts talking on my phone i get annoyed i don't want to hear it i don't want siri um and i wonder if there's too much of that that be good call maybe they yeah maybe they call off yeah we'll see i'd say the odds are probably less than 50% but that would be interesting if they did that move that's that's fun stuff uh we talked uh last week about the you know the economic relationship between open ai and apple and i would just kind of uh have an evolving view about how apple is impacted by this you know the substance of a lot of the products that microsoft has that amazon has that apple will have in the near term is going to be based on third parties whether it's through partnerships with google and thropic or with open ai and it i i just want to let the record state my opinion here is that i think that really the soul of these companies is going to be in someone else's hands probably in apple's case for the next one to three years and then i think that they will continue to come up with small language models they have this ajax and i think that they can potentially come out with a large language model and start to kind of wean themselves off and i'm curious i like that view because it gives apple its destiny i think back in its own control what's the reality of apple three years from now having a model that could displace whoever they do the partnership with next week apple maps versus google maps is the first thing that comes to mind can they build a large language model yes will it be nearly as good as google or open ais i highly doubt it just like we see in maps for the same exact reason which is google maps has more resources it has more information it has more data and it's a better product and i think that apple will run into the same problem if they try to really build its own large language model and go head-to-head with those superior products cautionary tale we'll leave it there our final topic is this has kind of been sneaking up on us no pun intended here but the autonomous vehicle this 2024 the year of the robo taxi and um bloomberg did a nice piece today about zeus this is a company that amazon acquired four years ago they're launching a robo taxi in las vegas i feel like everybody wants to test their robo taxis in las vegas it actually does go more normal speeds i think that's like 30 40 mes an hour and the um you know that it kind of reminds there's just a lot of negative headlines around autonomy kind of late last year with ford exiting argo with what happened with cruz and san francisco they've kind of retreated to uh phoenix and there's another city there but like quietly with what's going on with tesla and their august 8th day and then what we got what's going on with amazon that i mentioned it's like this is kind of like moving forward yeah lowkey it kind of feels like it's it's been a year of of progress on driverless autonomy um even though the big story has been large language models i mean the big story has been sort of the big brother i guess to to autonomy in the auto space but it still feels like you know we're making this progress we're making these steps and in some ways i think it's a good thing that you know broader ai these large large language models chat pt have maybe taken some of the spotlight away from the self-driving thing because i think think self-driving was kind of like the headline ai thing for the last couple of years we didn't have chat gbt two years ago and we were sort of front and center with you know driverless cars the testing like you mentioned cruise and some of the things that have not worked uber if you remember that story from from was that called x division x or something i forget but i for what they called that yeah it's been it's been progress that's been good and i think we're seeing these companies continue to move forward i think i think it's still going to take time but they're not dying and going away which is good end on this question do you think that autonomy will have an uh i'll give you the final word i'll answer first give you the final word will autonomy have a gpt breakthrough moment i believe yes i believe all the underpinnings of what's going on with computer vision that's powering autonomy has the opportunity to have a a breakthrough moment what's your timing on the breakthrough moment two years how many years two years i take the over i i i think the answer is yes too but i'll stick with my my uh statement which is i still think this is further away than we want or think and i would say it's probably more like four years away okay but it will be like a breakthrough moment i think there will be a moment where people say wow this this is actually way better than i thought um i don't know what that that'll look like because we've already seen tesla with fsd like there are these products you could argue it has but it doesn't feel like it's captured the the imagination like chat pt has yet so see it on like your rural roads i think that's where it's a big hard where you can't just go and jump in you can just go and pull up a browser and jump in gpt you can't really do that with autonomy so there's some uh to say there's adoption friction is an understatement uh can't wait for august 8th and i can't wait for next week our next episode on behalf of deep tech bye for now
006: An Apple Watch for Your Brain ft. Neurable CEO Ramses Alcaide,2024-02-02 19:21:25+00:00,29,1WQkXZhsEPk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WQkXZhsEPk,"welcome to deep tech 315 i'm jean along with doug and our three topics today are what is the probability we actually see autonomous vehicles in the next three years especially after what we heard from nitsa and tesla this week second we're going to talk about adobe and their recent earnings and what it means for the substance of revenue growth from ai and last we're going to talk about intel's ai everywhere event and where that puts in into the stacking order the totem pole of tech hardware infrastructure related to ai and so taking it back to the top uh this week we had a day when uh the market was essentially flat tesla shares were down about two and a half percent there was news that there was a two million vehicle recall i say that in quotes because it's a software update i still have a hard time thinking about these as recalls but we'll we'll play along with this nitsa and essentially what it does is it makes it so when you're using us autopilot you get more notifications also known as nags that say make sure your hands are on the wheel there's better controls where you can't uh like floor it through a stop sign and and just totally override um autopilot there is a little bit more strength that autopilot has to make sure that you stay within the boundaries but mostly it's related to messaging and just kind of making sure people are doing what they're doing and the reason why all this came up was because uh there have been accidents with people using autopilot and it is a reminder to me that we're not where i thought we would be at this point doug i know a few years ago i said by 2024 we'd have full self- drive and you said no chance and uh here we are now with uh the this dynamic with niton and i just keep thinking i'm i keep hoping for this breakthrough moment very similar to what we saw at cat gpt when it comes to autonomy when the models just just kind of hit that inflection point where the march of nines kind of falls into order and we get waila autonomy i think things in technology always take longer than you expect i mean this is just the most recent lesson and throughout history that's always been true and so i think we should expect that we will get self-driving it's an extremely complex thing to figure out and i think that we're seeing some stuff with crws in san francisco there was an issue there obviously recently uh that was shut down now for all practical purposes exactly and and we're going to have these fits and starts as we have breakthrough technologies like these because it's not just about making the tech work and putting it out in the wild it's also about conforming to societal expectations and then ultimately there will be government regulations here that need to be dealt with and so all those things add up to a puzzle that will end up taking longer than we think i again like i say what i've been saying the whole time like we will get there we will get self-driving but uh you have to be a rational optimist and you have to extend your timeline because the government is going to operate on its own expectations not as fast as we want eventually the governments needs to look at the data the safety data and i have this belief too that we're gonna again we're gonna have this breakthrough moment that eventually the models just kind of uh kind of uh check over uh click over to to a new level that is acceptable again that jet gpt example and i guess why wouldn't that be why wouldn't we expect that because governments don't operate on rational probabilities and data i don't believe you could tell yourself a story that they do but i think uh reasonable people would say they don't that's fair they they operate on a motion people get elected on a motion and when a robotic car hits a person that matters more than any data that you can show about how safe they are and and that's just the world we live in whether we like it or not well uh the the data that tesla has by the way in terms of how safe a car is with autopilot it's seven times less likely to get know accent than a a car without autopilot now that's their data even if you i think adjust for that i think it's safe to say that they are safer and like you said is now we we still have nitsa kind of picking uh picking fights here with autopilot even though it is safer for those of you who've been following doug and i for a little bit you know this is like a a pretty hot topic for me i think it is a huge issue uh i was uh reminded yesterday that 43,000 people lost their lives in 2022 in the us in car accidents and it's maddening to me i i feel horrible for the people that uh had uh these these life-changing outcomes with fs with uh autonomy um with autopilot but but there's a lot of uh safety improvement that can come across the board so we're going to shift to our next to one more thought though there's a saying in finance i've always loved which is do you want to be right or do you want to make money and i think that you can extrapolate that saying into technology a lot do you want to be sort of morally right or do you want to be literally right and i think that's where this debate comes in i want cars to drive people yeah self-driving cars are safer drivers than human beings i think in aggregate but that doesn't matter from a timeline perspective that's what we need to understand if you want to bet on when this is actually going to happen when this is literally going to happen right i think you have to factor in all these other issues around governments and slowing timelines and then finances around that we're seeing issues with crews and them laying off more than 20% of their workers and so we're going to get it but just be realistic about the timeline of it fair enough i just want to throw one more stat in there too is tesla at the end of the first quarter they had 150 million actual miles driven by fsd at the end of june it was 300 so it doubled they gave an indication that kind of expected to be around 600 million at the end of september it came in at 520 so a little bit of a miss there in terms of total miles driven on fsd in the most recent quarter like you said it's going to take some time uh next topic is adobe they reported uh stock traded off five six percent after they had reported and they gave guidance for the first time i think little bit misleading here on the the sell off stock is up 80 plus percent year-to dat so it's had a huge run up and we are investors in adobe at at deep water and a believer that eventually these products uh for example firefly and and photoshop elements is or express is going to start to add these ai type features for image generation and content creation and get more people to start to buy their products people like like me spending $10 a month from for the basic photoshop product um and so the the guidance that they gave kind of left people wondering are we really going to see the uptake and the substance of ai sales happening for adobe in 2024 probably not i think is is the realistic answer and if you think about really the regime we're going into this year has been all about the mass experience of ai everybody's getting to touch ai if you use chaty pt if you use firefly on adobe which is great i mean the product is incredible from a consumer usage standpoint but then the question is well is ai additive enough that they can charge more for the product or is it just a different interface and i think we're going to have that discussion a lot in 2024 about a lot of different businesses and for adobe i don't know if they've proven yet that firefly is anything more than just a better interface where you don't have to know all the intricacies of adobe programming tools right you can just use uh natural language and i think that natural language and what ai will be in many cases it will be the new ui layer for every piece of software because it's easier to use than learning you know a different system every time one other thing i think is important too is to think about a company like adobe or even microsoft which we also uh own in one of our ai selected funds powered by ai is to put into scale like how big these companies are and what ai needs to do to move the needle it's really hard microsoft has 350 million paying customers right now if 10% of those customers convert to co-pilot customers and they pay 30 bucks a month that's a 5% tailwind to revenue that's how big microsoft is so we're talking about companies that are just so big they really the 5% is not that much for microsoft do you think a 5% revenue tailwind is that much i think it is well i think it's underwhelming well for a company that size it's like that moves the needle but when but when you're trading at over 30 times forward earnings i think you need more than a potential 5% revenue tailwind matter maybe copilot maybe co-pilot gets greater conversion it could be 10% it could be you know maybe all of the business eventually touches co-pilot somehow and everybody's paying another $30 a month that's the super bull case mh but i think it's just it's useful to remember how big these companies are and then put that in the context of how are you going to charge for ai and actually make real revenue that changes the game and now i'm thinking for next year i me we are all in on ai we think ultimately this is going to exceed all the hype and be more transformative than we can imagine today so as just a base that's how we're thinking about this at deep water but this conversation it makes me think should we have a little bit more modest expectations beyond adobi just across the board in terms of actual seeing actual hard monetization of ai in 2024 i think about it in two worlds and like one of the worlds there's a there's an a and a b world there's the mega cap tech world and then there's the you know small midcap and then later stage private world and in the mega cap tech world i think we are going to run into these questions about where is the real significant revenue opportunity there's absolutely a revenue opportunity but is it significant enough and coming fast enough to really move the needle for some of these companies because again they're all priced uh with fairly rich multiples we've seen the move in the qqq this year all of the mag7 are up i believe over 50% year to date if not more facebook's over 150 i think um so i think you got that as part one of the story part two of the story though is some of these other companies where they're much smaller and if they do have a hit product we're not talking about it being a 5% tailwind of revenue we're talking about revenue being up 100 200 300% potentially you know in a year or two and i think that's the more exciting space to play in that's where we've been spending a lot of our time trying to build our portfolios around the right companies and i do think a lot of them are still actually in the private markets yeah definitely that's we do spend a lot of time talking about those private ai companies uh which gets us uh we're talking about big companies we're going to end on a big company note mentioned that intel had their ai everywhere event uh this follows amd's ai event and uh and nvidia's results recently it's like every kind of chip related company is now weighed in over the past month and there's just generally the f first of all for the announcements the product announcements were just generally upgrades and marketing around new chip infrast structure for next generation uh for just new new chip designs for their current products no more cpu related they talked about having the first true ai chip for a pc i think apple with their m3 chip would probably take issue with that we're not going to go and debate the specs here but that was kind of the context then they have this uh this gudi chip it's a company that they had acquired that is an ai accelerator ai accelerator is code for basically a gpu for um for for all for for the sake of this conversation and that's obviously where all the growth has been from gpus and i think back about what nvidia has said that that we're moving past a cpu world that this is a gpu world for for more on the training side maybe for the inference and then intel today intel is saying that there's still a lot of life left with the cpu and where's going to be a huge need for cpus and my question isn't is there going to be a a need for cpus i'm just trying to get get a sense of is where's the growth coming from is it the a acceleration or the cpus uh i mean the growth market in uh compute in general is certainly in the ai accelerator space i mean i think we talked about this before but amd at their ai day just a week ago i mean they talked about the ai accelerator opportunity in 2027 they thought at the beginning of the year was a $150 billion market and last week they said it's a $400 billion market so i mean they they upsized their uh their estimation by more than 100% um so i think uh piece one is it's all about the gpu when we're talking about compute when we're talking about the cloud i think that that is no question sort of game over where the cpu comes in is what happens locally right cpus are what drive our phones they're what drive our our laptops and there is a world and there is a use case certainly where people can be running ai uh inference locally so you know you're not going to train a model probably locally unless it's a very small model but if you are asking a model questions let's say you download a model to your phone or you download an ai model to your computer you could just run it locally there you don't need to send data back to a cloud somewhere uh and that could run on your cpu still got that it becomes a question of like is that better for who right like the average user probably doesn't care they don't care if something's done in the cloud or locally there's some privacy benefits but most people just aren't even going to think about it i think the question is maybe from some enterprise use cases do they want to run uh inference locally and does that mean that they maybe need to optimize some of their machines around local inference uh maybe there's a play there but you know it feels really small to me and sort of on the margin at this point i'll take uh nvidia over intel and the over under here i think the i'll take the ai accelerator and i'll take an opportunity to join you again in a week on behalf of deep tech 315 that's doug i'm jean bye for now all right"
DeepTech315: Meta / Google / Apple,2024-02-02 20:57:00+00:00,18,oYp3fUK25Ds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYp3fUK25Ds,i'm gene munster managing partner and head of portfolio research at deepwater asset management and this is pressure points our topic today is meta's annual developer conference connect we're going to talk about first their vision of the next computing platform and how that compares to apples and where they stand second is about quest 3 their new headset and last talk about how they're bringing ai into some of the messaging products so we'll go to the top and the biggest piece that jumped out at to me was zuckerberg and how he explained this next computing paradigm obviously the language that they've used around this for the last four years has been the metaverse they of course stuck to that language but the language was heavy on merging the physical and the digital worlds and that of course is a very similar view that apple has they don't use the word metaverse they will never use the word metaverse they use the word spatial computing but it is also all about merging the physical and digital worlds going into today's event i wasn't sure if zuckerberg was going to anchor on the gaming side of things or potentially on some still legacy vr related to it but he was all in on what i think is the exact same vision that apple has so called the metaverse call it spatial computing either way you cut it both of these companies believe there's a new computing platform that's coming a new way that we will interface with technology beyond the computer and the phone and that being through a headset now the problem for meta is that the products and the experiences the software the hardware that they showed today is a full light year behind where apple is at with vision pro when i demoed vision pro i was blown away by it back in june and as i saw some of the renderings and experiences it's still much different now the price point is much different too and many will make the argument that this is kind of a everyday person's version of spatial computing the metaverse is but at the end of the day consumers want exciting experiences and i don't think that the meta what they're doing today in the next six months around the metaverse is going to be that exciting for people to jump in conversely i think when apple comes out with vision pro people are going to be really excited about it now they're not going to buy many of those headsets because they're so expensive 3 500 but they will be excited about it and i think it will lay the groundwork for future versions cheaper versions of apple's products uh apple's wearables products to start to pick up traction three four five years down the road but when you put it all together these two companies are on uh head-on collision cores here related to is next computing platform it's going to be fun to see how this all plays out so that was the biggest takeaway second i want to talk a little bit about quest 3 the hardware they announced this hardware a few days before apple announced vision pro so we've known about this since back in june uh what is new today is the release date is going to come out on the 10th but still that same 500 price point again that's far less 1 7 the cost of a vision a pro so quest 3 much cheaper therefore it is going to be considered to be more mainstream there i have never uh meta has never given units for quest 2 which came out in 22 how many units they sell per year but my sense is it's been around 5 million five plus million units per year and after seeing this device it definitely is an improvement from quest 2. i think that they will sell more headsets than of quest 3 per year than they sold quest 2 maybe 5 to 10 million in but this is not going to be a breakaway product where people experience it and just say you gotta have it i think this is still a learning product i think it's still a building product for meta and it's all moving in the right direction since it's not a breakthrough product you may get some investors wanting to see more and maybe calling into question the level of investment that meta is making in reality labs i think it's the worthy investment for them to be putting out quest 3 i think that it's important that they have a position in this next computing paradigm so putting it together i'm glad that they're doing it deepwater is an investor in meta and we're glad that they are continuing to pursue this opportunity so that's quest 3 and then the last point is related to ai and of course they have their llama 2 model out which is basically the same thing as chat gpt or google gemini or anthropics claude products it's the kind of the four key generative ai applications so they're going to be implementing those models into some of their messaging they have a product called meta.ai which is going to go into facebook messenger and instagram direct message and also whatsapp allow you to kind of enhance your messaging conversation you're having with another human by adding in some generative ai to that and on top of that they announce a new visual product uh called i'm going to make sure i get the acronym cur correct here it is emu as an expressive media universe and that is essentially it's like mid-journey or dolly but emu is going to also be part of the chat experiences across their platforms and allow you to do some fun things in instagram because instagram is a video and photo driven platform so i think that this uh this implementation of ai a visual uh image generator inside of messaging is going to be a home run they're gonna get a ton of usage out of it and they will it will fundamentally change i think how people view and use instagram because it's going to add just so much more ai context bigger better deeper fakes but also more creativity and so those are the two they also announced some basically they're like a celebrity endorsed ai characters and so i don't know much about celebrities i don't know many of them i know who tom brady is he's one of them and they uh well you'll be able to interact essentially message with this just kind of a fun thing and i bet a lot of people are going to use them you can do it just for peer entertainment to see what a celebrity would how they would respond to a conversation with you but also they some of these celebrities have domain knowledge that you may ask get advice on travel or cooking or education things like that so there's just a fun entertainment factor to these but there's also some utility from these and at the end of the day meta's in the game of attention this is a tension game and i think that these celebrity endorsed ai chat bots are going to be a way that people experience ai in a more fun way and they're going to gain a lot of attention from i think a lot of people will use this and so when we put it all together tale of two cities today on the ai front they're adding some fun capabilities that i think are going to increase engagement on meta's platform separately when it comes to the kind of the spatial computing the metaverse side it's clear that apple has a major lead here so on behalf of deepwater i'm gene munster and bye for now
Pressure Points: Vision Pro Review,2024-02-06 00:08:08+00:00,36,2Fipyllpymk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fipyllpymk,"welcome to deep tech 315 i'm jean and that is mike uh mike is joining us uh this week as uh he is a venture partner at deep waterer for those you've been following me for a long time mike has been an important part of my career now my calling uh mike is famously known in 2004 2005 i forget the exact year but he coined the term halo effect uh he has a hard time uh acknowledging this i can tell you it is true uh the concept of buying a product and uh then wanting to buy other products from a company uh he famously associated the concept of an ipod to buying macs and so awesome call we've had a ton of fun working together i wanted you to join related to what we're hearing in some of the private markets related to ai that is our second topic our first topic is related to nvidia and our last topic is tesla so in uh in in this order we'll kick it off with nvidia earnings of course that was the big one this week uh results exceeded expectations high expectations on the top end by 6% they guided the july quarter 5% higher than where the street was at and of course uh the stock was moving in the right direction it was up about 3% and then jenson during the earnings call said that they're going to sell a lot a ton uh of b100 b2 200s in two in uh this fiscal year and the stock continued to move higher ended up closing up 10% uh there's been a ton of scrutiny related to the nvidia earnings but i want to take it in a slightly different direction what we saw with nvidia is important because it shows that the pace of innovation the pace of building the infrastructure around ai is accelerating uh we've had high expectations around this speed that this infrastructure is being built and they are exceeding those high expectations and the reason why that's important as you layer that in with a comment that uh sam alman had this week at microsoft build day was that the reason why that infrastructure is important is that gets us closer to these plateau step ups the speed of improvement in the models and why that is important is that the faster we are revving on the models the more quickly we are going to get to artificial general intelligence and if we think that what we're seeing in generative ai is groundbreaking when we see general intelligence it's going to be five orders of magnitude more impactful every company every information worker every technical worker is going to be impacted by this and so i left uh the nvidia forget about the the the the earnings forget about the this next quarter forget about what 2025 is forget about nvidia stock what's important is is that ai is happening it's happening faster and i think that this ultimately is going to lay the groundwork for what's going to be a 3 to 5e bull market that will end a spectacular bursting of a bubble uh potentially even bigger than what we saw in 2000 just given the fact that ai is going to be more transformative and so that was the takeaway on it there's a lot of different ways that you can invest in that i just think in general forget about inflation that's noise on the edges what we're seeing around this building infastructure on ai getting faster to general intelligence was the key takeaway from nvidia earnings so we're going to sh what do you think slows down nvidia do we ever reach a a plateau or a saturation point on chips like i i've heard some some chatter out there that hundred billion dollar has been spent on ai infrastructure and only $3 billion in revenue has been generated how do we how do we get to a point where there's an equilibrium there and and does that ultimately have a negative impact on nvidia if we if we don't get there soon the growth is going to slow dramatically a year ago this is just mind-blowing to me in in the april quarter of 20123 their business was down 133% uh year-over-year and then of course the most recent quarter was up almost 270% they guided for the uh july quarter to be up 107% and the street now is looking for 28% growth in calendar 25 and so uh what is going to cause it to slow number one is this is i mean we've seen this before we've we've watched we've exper we've had front row seats to all these companies there's never been a story like this in terms of hard comps at scale like we're seeing with nvidia so the growth rate is going to slow number one what's going to keep it going ultimately is that there are these four layers of the cake when it comes to ai uh jensen talks about these it's training and inference at the top we've got applications at the second layer industrial ai still not quite sure what industrial ai is and then sovereign which is countries and so the uh the the uh nvidia is not going to grow at 40% forever the growth rate is going to step down pretty significantly um uh and ultimately i think that it will exceed expectations for the next uh a few years i think that'll grow probably 35% through 25 26 calendar 25 or 26 um but they are those those other three stacks in the layer that are coming applications ind industrial and sovereign and so i think that there's enough still expansion for this to continue but uh you know as i as i was angling towards at the top what's really important to me is just beyond nvidia and just thinking like this is just laying the groundwork which gets us to our second topic which uh something that you've been paying close attention to this past week is the three developer days uh i guess we had the one this week with bill but of course the two uh last week and there really wasn't a ton to say about microsoft i think it was generally underwhelming i think that they essentially got previewed by what open ai said in the previous week so we're not going to spend a ton of time talking about that but as i was thinking about the relationship with open ai and microsoft and thinking about how critical i mean the so of microsoft right now is open ai a private company that was basically sub 100 million in revenue a year ago now two billion plus just how important these private investments are for these mega caps and so i thought it'd be great to bring you on and just give us some perspective like oneone you're venture partner you're looking at deals uh what do you seen in terms of just what the ai private uh landscape looks like and what are the big tech companies doing relative to investing in some of these smaller companies yeah i mean to your point something we're seeing increasingly is is the mega cap companies getting more aggressive with venture deals and they're investing earlier in some cases they're investing in companies that are directly uh competitive with with other comp companies that are in their portfolio or even uh uh competitive with stuff that they're doing i mean look at microsoft they hold a large equity stake in open ai but now they're competing directly with openi through the development of of some of their own models and then you have when you said they're early like how early are we seeing some of these are they in doing at c rounds are they a rounds like how early is early well we're seeing these big tech companies coming in yeah i mean the ones you hear about are obviously uh open ai ropic with google and amazon both both diving in there and those are the ones that uh are in the media those are also the ones that the the ftc might take a look at which we can talk about in a minute um but the answer to your question is super early so we're seeing u some of these megga meap companies participating in precede rounds with pre-revenue companies yeah i mean instances where it's just you know two founders in a in a deck potentially and so that makes it um you know a situation where again to get into the the regulatory piece that i alluded to the the companies are are working harder to try to uh get position to to benefit from some of these trends going forward but they need to be cautious about the potential ftc ramifications of that and i think the earlier that they participate in some of these companies uh the better off they'll be uh avoiding just investing in already you know unicorn or or multi-billion dollar companies that should help them the theory is by investing earlier than they won't be is under the the microscope when it comes to the ftc yeah exactly and so back to what i said you know preed rounds seed rounds etc for example a company we recently invested in out of deep water venture fund 2 at um you know a low tens of millions valuation that's a pre-revenue company uh microsoft came on as a investor after we were the first money into that company so they're getting involved earlier um it does create uh more competitive uh environment in some ways but in other ways uh the competition has always been there and it's just something that whether it's from large u mega cap companies looking to get involved in these types of deals or whether it's just other venture funds or entities um that may be looking to get uh directly involved in investment in a pre-seed or seat company we've had to always deal with that competition so in some ways it's different but in a lot of ways it's similar so two questions one is uh when you talk about competition what does it mean in terms of valuations remember when we were doing investments in 2018 a typical preed round was right around 8 to 10 million or a seed round that's post money valuation they'd be raising a million dollars uh what does it look like in ai uh private uh seed world today in terms of valuations yeah the average or median hasn't really changed um significantly we're kind of looking at you know 8 to 10 million like you said back in 2018 to something uh more like the low low to mid double digits so let say 12 to 15 million today um the uh the point that you made on ai is important which is that that's all dependent on what segment of of um you know tech we're looking at so ai is going to have um generally speaking uh a little bit frothier valuations than than other segments and that that froth is i don't mean to to belittle it it's it's it's well taken it's important uh to note that that it's it's flo froth but not fluff in the sense that um ai is obviously the next major paradigm shift in tech so uh that those valuations are well deserved um the equity what is the what are they is it is it 15 million are you typically seen uh 30 million what's the yeah i mentioned the one we did um fairly recently where it was more of a 30 million valuation a preed round preven pre- revenue company so this would have been 8 million in 2018 something like that yeah so it's a big big change on um on the ai front but you always see that with different um cycles uh over time we're going to see different areas of the market that are going to have frothier valuations than other and again i i don't mean to suggest that froth is fluff because the froth is often welld deserved given what's going on in that that specific industry big is probably having an impact there probably bigger vcs that are pushing lower to and the combo all that and probably founders too they know that they can ask for more as well they they they understand what the temperature is out there um yeah that that that's a good point just quickly on that as far as the founders is that the the old kind of rule of thumb is that money gets 20 what does that me yeah so investors uh new investors into a company are going to take a 20% state uh in that given funding round so for example you raised uh $2 million that's a uh money gets 20 to10 million valuation okay y is that rule is that rule still holding with ai companies yeah that's what i was going to say is that it it's holding broadly but with ai uh it is uh as you might imagine those founders believe that they are positioned to put themselves in a a place where they can get a a larger stake going forward and as a result they may be more of a um you know money gets 10 or money gets 15 so they're retaining closer to 90% of the economics so it really depends on the space and and right now obviously ai is space oh one we still got one more topic to get to but one quick one here is big tech taking a spray and prey type of approach to doing this or do you think it's strategic in this in these early rounds i think it's a little of both uh and we're seeing it pretty broad-based i mentioned earlier a lot of the mega cap companies are involved um but we're seeing a lot of other tech companies that are increasingly pushing a a venture piece of their business so um the the answer to that question is a lot of it is spray and prey to be honest and we're seeing you know not not tens of deals from these companies but over a multi-year period hundreds of deals okay they're really active yeah exactly uh great to know great perspective and we're going to shift to our final topic which is tesla some work that brian baker from our team and i have done along with some help i want to give attribution check out our print uh uh story on this but expectations for tesla's autonomy day uh cut to the chase we think there's going to be three vehicles announced of course the robo taxi uh the model 2 model a call it what you like but the $225,000 version uh could be a strong rift off of robo taxi that robo taxi is probably going to come through in a demo where they will use the summon feature in the hail app and have that vehicle come around if it doesn't come out as a demo i think that that would be a disappointment and and the one piece where i would say we're a little bit more out on the limon is related to uh some sort of a van that plays into the autonomy opportunity so think of this kind of as the beginning of uh a different way to move around urban areas kind of a new form of public transportation a private public transportation form kind an 8 to 10 person vehicle uh we did go back and look here's the bad news is that over since uh the model three came out the the the minimum gap between when they announce to when they get out the door is 10 months so it's going to be a while before we see these products thanks for joining mike thanks everyone else for giving a listen on behalf of deep water bye for now"
Pressure Points: Meta's AI,2024-02-08 18:32:14+00:00,9,ptBxdxHNeHI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptBxdxHNeHI,i'm doug clinton co-founder and managing partner at deepwater asset management and this is the dlo podcast where i interview founders and builders of companies who are building products that will change how we live today i talk to jack kendall he's the cto of rain ai which is one of our portfolio companies at deepwater jack and i talk all things ai it's a 401 level course on what is happening right now in generative ai how rain and the chips that they are building will ultimately help accelerate the progress in ai and jack's prediction on when we will achieve artificial general intelligence so now here is jack kendall from r right jack good to see you as always so i wanted to start and i think you're in kind of a really cool unique position to to speak to this if you if you kind of think about the history of ai the evolution of ai over the last decade or so um it's gone very much from from sort of this like research world where things were happening you know in labs kind of in very concealed environments to now even in just really the last year with chat gpt kind of this wide open experiment in the real world and i'm curious how you think about because you still have a very strong research focus at rain how do you think about that balance between the research side of ai and the commercialization of it that's a great question and so i'll say you know my philosophy and the philosophy of rain is that we have a really strong focus on fundamental research and it's it's built into our dna it's helped inform a lot of our our road map and the trajectory of rain now my sort of inspiration for this and kind of like the the guiding star organization for me has always been bell laps actually and labs you know was the this is where the transistor was invented among many other important inventions but they really showed how to and that it was possible to do research in basic science and translate those advances from the world of basic science to commercialization and to really impactful technologies like the transistor i think there are other examples of organizations like deep mind to be honest comes to mind yeah you know deep really made some incredible innovations in um reinforcement learning they were the ones who really showed how to combine reinforcement learning with deep learning for the first time and you know they were obviously able to bring to commercialization incredible tools of particular note alpha fold um i think you know alfold made some splash a modest splash in the scientific community but i think it's been you know undervalued as what i really think is one of the most important technological innovations of the 21st century so that's another really great example and this is a philosophy that we like to take um you know my research on essentially equilibrium propagation is is an example of this but how to how to perform training in deep neural networks in completely analog subst tra you know this is an algorithm that was uh invented by one of yosua benio's students and an engineer at rain whose name is ben celier and they really laid the the seed of this innovation and what rain did and what i did at rain is take this algorithm which primarily was working on software networks and show how you can actually extend that to train physical systems and to perform what is almost like a self-contained physical learning system um and this has been a really big part of our research and we're pushing this towards commercialization as well um although this is on a longer time horizon than our immediate commercialization um endeavors that's sort of an example of how things work at r yeah i think the bell labs uh comparison is such a great one i mean i think of claude shannon and information theory and all the incredible things came from bell labs um it's it's cool to think of a world like that and even i think google was inspired you know so of the 20% time if i remember was maybe inspired by bell labs is that do you think that's kind of the right comp is you think about building an organization that thinks about this that you know maybe it is whatever 20% time arbitrarily um that that is the right amount of resources to put toward this forward thinking research versus what's ready to go today yeah i think that that's a good i think it depends on the scale of your organization too as well you know rain we're 35 people or so and so you know we have a a product to get to market and so i think for us it's probably more maybe closer to 10% um and we have a but i think that the 10% that we have is a really focused team that is dedicated towards this type of frontier research um whereas maybe at a larger organization like google you can have more resources once you've got you know revenue new coming in and you know a stable baseline for that but yeah i think it's organization dependent but uh yeah i think especially in the ai space you know you've seen it with open ai as well like an emphasis on fundamental research can pay massive dividends for eventually coming to to commercialization and you know the difference between who won with chat gbt right uh who got to that level first i mean maybe that was a matter of money months right yeah and it was just a little bit of extra resources put into one organization versus the other so yeah i mean being first is is a huge advantage in so many different ways and then it fuels more research i mean it's a it's a cyclical thing and it fuels more data more important like that's the big that's the biggest advantage that came out of you know open ai getting to this to chat gpt first was that all of a sudden they had millions of users interacting with these systems and the other the competitors didn't right and i mean i think you you'll see that and we have seen that data is everything right the models once the transformer architecture was invented you know model architecture didn't really matter that much other than scale compared to quality and the amount of data that you have yep if you think about what we're talking about now the context you mentioned open ai you know and there's been some some crazy things happening there with with sam mman gone and back we don't need to recap the whole story i'm sure i'm sure everybody's probably aware of it but the fundamental question i think does in some ways circle back to this idea of research and maybe how far along they are on the path to you know agi do you think that they are maybe closer than the world realizes was that what what sparked this whole thing so i can give you my thought on this they're going to be a little nuan and maybe require a little bit of an explanation and some background so so bear with me here but here's here's what i think um this is worth noting this is all speculation at this point all anybody can do right now is speculate because we don't know exactly what happened um but for context um you know not everybody is a believer in deep learning and i know that that seems you know know more and more a little um i don't want to say ridiculous but maybe not entirely true i think we've seen the power of certainly seen the power of deep learning especially over the past year but many people remain skeptics that it will bring us towards you know quote true intelligence of course what they mean by true intelligence keeps you know they keep moving the goal yeah um but there have been two good arguments that i think um have that support them that they have to to support this idea that deep learning maybe won't take us towards true intelligence and that is uh the first one is that deep learning can't do causal reasoning it's only doing pattern recognition and i think this has been you know my opinion is that this has been demonstrated to be incorrect that deep learning is capable of doing clausal understanding and i think you wouldn't be able to have a conversation with chaty bt if it didn't have some level of causal reasoning or a caa model baked in to the network and you know to give an example of this like if you go and you say to chat bt or showed an image maybe of a girl holding balloons and you say what will happen if i cut the strings it will answer that the balloons will fly away right and that requires a causal model of the world in order to do that now that's just an anecdote and you can construct many other anecdotes about this but as far as the actual research to support this in 2018 deep mind showed that using reinforcement learning if you have a reinforcement learning agent they are actually able to extract causal information from their environment and the reason that they're able to do this is because they can perform interventions they can do kind of like almost experiments um and they can influence the data that's incoming to them uh and learn causal information as a result so i think that that is that sort of you know argument from the anti- deep learning crowd is no longer true and these models do now have some level of causal reasoning the other big one is symbolic reasoning and this is the one that i think is relevant to open ai right now the argument is that deep learning models can't do symbolic reasoning like humans do symbolic reasoning and i'll give you an example of what i mean by this let's say that you know i know from my you know from the data that i've been taking in from a child i have learned that all dogs are mammals right and all mammals have fur so i know these two facts and i can reason about them and for instance what i can do is i can say my friend's dog maybe which maybe i've never met before or i've never seen before in my life i immediately can deduce that that dog has fur from these two states and this is just a very simple example of using symbolic reasoning and relationships between the the sort of internal symbols that i have for dog for mammal and for fur right deep learning models modern deep learning models they can't really do this they're kind of very bad at this the pinnacle i think of this is mathematical reasoning in order to do and you've noticed maybe that uh chat gbt can't do math um in particular it's very poor at doing math and it's because it lacks this symbolic reasoning i believe that uh the breakthrough that open ai is working with right now you know people are referring to it as qar involves mathematical reasoning and in particular i think this is an indication that symbolic reasoning is being solved so the implications of this are quite huge you know even if this model was doing middle school arithmetic the fact that it is doing symbolic reasoning in mathematics at all means that there are no more missing pieces right you have all the ingredients that you need for a and we're still a long way away from human level intelligence but the type of intelligence that we have maybe we're closer than than people think and it might just be a matter of scaling these models and data sets and at that point it's just an engineering challenge right so i that's my take that's my read on why ilot or the board or the people with more knowledge than i do uh might have reacted like that see if that's true would it be fair to say that we are on the verge i guess of agi even if the verge means we're still still let's say 10 years away or 15 years away but we've fundamentally got to your point all the pieces of it and and we should sort of assume that hey the probabilities of us getting there are pretty high so you know i' i've said for for many years now that i think that agi is going to be achieved in 2025 um and we're getting closer and closer to 2025 and my prediction has not changed um i still believe that we're going to hit it in 202 five and this is like i wasn't sure when this i knew that the last thing the last missing piece was simple simple process processing um the combination of what's called the symbol grounding problem and the binding problem as it refers to like neuroscience but these these problems both i believe are are on the verge of being solved or perhaps may have already been solved at the research level and you know just to give as some more concrete example to support this um there already has been research that shows that transformer architectures which is what powers chbt um they are capable of doing some symbolic reasoning so some symbolic reasoning tasks can already be solved with transformers just not generally and you can actually extend these capabilities by modifying the transform architecture with things like scratch pads um but this i think it's it's quite likely that this last piece is going to be solved quite soon now as far as whether that means we're at agi it depends on your definition of agi right some people believe that agi means human level intelligence and i don't hold that that's not my definition of agi that's my definition of human level intelligence right i think we're a long way away from human level intelligence but what i think of as agi is i have a few you know i have a few um things that i you know have have written down here that i think define agi so i define agi is a single network architecture that can in principle learn any combination of data modalities for example speech vision and language so we already have that check mark use prior experience to learn new things rapidly i think that's part of causal understanding and to reason about things or perform tasks it hasn't seen or done before and i think that's what really requires symbolic reasoning so if you have these three things i think you know it can do you know you can maybe tell a machine to go do the dishes for you and you know i think robotics is actually something that's lagging behind the rest of these things but you know in principle that would would become possible it would be able to understand and execute on on a task like that i i think that's what makes a general intelligence i think that's a great definition and so if we have had this breakthrough then on the symbolic reasoning side and we do get to your definition of agi by 2025 that doesn't necessarily mean that um the world would look maybe a lot different than it does today does it i mean i think that's the concern when people think about ai right it's like oh artificial general intelligence you know jobs are gone and now then we get super intelligence and we can get into that whole train of thought but but as you think about it you know what what does that mean in 2025 so i think it it means you know it'll have the same impact that chad gbt had when it launched which is that people are going to be like oh damn this is real you know but as far as actually having a you know an economic impact i think that some things have certainly been economically impacted and people are making decisions based on predictions of how things will change but i do think that it's you know it takes time for a technology like this to percolate through society and hopefully you know enough time for us to adequately prepare and this is you know i think been very good wakeup call for governments and people in general because you know i've been advocating for a long time that uh we need to do more to prepare for this um you know i think i'll mentioned andrew yang i think he was you know i don't agree with him on all of his views but i do have a huge amount of respect for him because he was really the first major politician to start pushing preparation for ai you know what automation that's that's definitely going to be coming so i don't know exactly what's going to happen when we have these general models but i suspect that they will take some time to be integrated into into society in meaningful ways obviously you're going to have automation of menial tasks um like you're going to now have the ability to you know have a system that knows your workflow and automates you know maybe can reply to emails and schedule appointments for you things that you don't have to do like that um but the real implications of this technology i think we're not going to see until significantly after 2025 when the when the breakthrough happens and if you think about society and the government are there any big things that stand out to you that you think they should be doing or legislation that should be talked about to prepare for this i think you have to put in place legislation that will protect people who have lost their jobs due to this technology and i think that should be funded by the gains that have been made by the corporations that are doing the automating right that's my personal belief um i know some people might not agree with that that's that's totally okay but there i i think that there you have to do something to protect the people who are going to lose their jobs um at least at least in a temporary sense because there will be job losses coming um i don't think we even know necessarily where they're going to get hit hardest you know we thought that trucking was going to be hit hard but it wasn't really you know at least not yet for reasons that you know some people predicted for sure but other people did not and it's that self-driving is harder than we thought so maybe that will be solved with these large language models you know maybe now you'll have systems that have world models you know that understand that a bag you know in the middle of the road is not going to destroy your car and you can just drive over it as compared to a brick in the middle of the road which maybe you want to avoid right that makes sense yeah and so if we think that a gi maybe is the the defining topic around ai in 2025 what do you think it is for next year you know what's the stepping stone to there i think that we're going to see mathematics happen that's the big one i think it's going to be mathematics um obviously like multimodality is already a solved problem in that you can have language and vision integrated within the same model and you've you know people have shown that they are capable of building world models you know these these large language models so they have some idea of how the world is is organized and it's not just i also want to emphasize you know to the viewers who may be watching that uh there's a lot of there's a widespread belief that you know chat gbt is just kind of fancy autocomplete and i don't disagree with that i disagree with the word just right the amount of knowledge and understanding like actual understanding that it requires to do this autocomplete there's a reason that it was not possible until very recently right this is an extraordinarily hard problem and if you want to do any if you want to answer a question like you know where is even a very simple question like where is mexico in relation to the united states that requires you to have a spatial understanding of the map of our world right and there are ways that you can probe that and you can know for sure that it's not just memorized all of this data because you can ask it questions that are certainly outside of its training data and it may not seem like that's possible to do but all you have to do is you know to to understand this all you have to do is say um stack a bunch of really unlikely things on top of each other in in a long chain right so for image generation i'll give you an example i'll say you know please generate an image of an elf on top of the empire state building wearing a crown which is surrounded by flames you know playing metal guitar you know with stars twinkling in the background and it will do it right it will do it and you can chain together as many unlikely things as you want and it will generalize and for certain that image was not in its training data and so it hasn't memorized its training data it has built a a model of the actual you know what we call is like the data generating process it's a it's really a manifold or like geometric object that is sort of underlying the space of data if you want to you know be mathematical about it um but it's not just it's not just autocomplete and it's not just memorizing things so i know that was a little bit of a you know a little bit long-winded but i think that's it i think it's super important too and it's it's if you use uh any of these tools i think in great depth to really do something like i i've used a series of the generative ai platforms to actually pick stocks and and i've i've done a lot of testing on it and i've built a lot of different portfolios and they're actually beating the markets in more than 65% of the cases so to your point of understanding like there's absolutely some form of understanding and when i talk to people about it like it often goes into this thing of well does it understand like a human no i don't think it does right but it understands to your point you know what what is being asked of it and how can it give you something that is a useful output based on that reasoning and there is there is you know a kernel of intelligence in there that's that's really the right way to think about it it's not like a human would understand things but there is some level of of understanding and there has to be in order for it to have the the performance that it has and to be able to do the things you know it's a long time ago i i talked with a researcher at my university you know at the university of florida and he was in you know ai and circuits and and things like that hardware instantiations especially and i was talking to him about like learning algorithms and you know how does the brain work and and things like that and i asked him like how do you judge there are so many different learning algorithms that people have put forward like how do you judge which one is the best and he just told me the proof is in the pudding like whichever one gets the best performance and does the most capable of doing the most things you know that's that's likely the closest to what the brain is doing and it's certainly the best one so the proof really is in in the pudding here it is it is so if 2024 let's say is kind of the year where we're talking about math uh and symbolic reasoning kind of coming into these models how do you think that will change how the average person sort of experiences generative ai i think there's a lot for me at least you know i do to be honest i do a lot of math so um but like i think that there's actually a major limiting factor that uh you can't really ask you can't get precise answers on things right especially that involve math and that's kind of the achilles heel right now of these models is that they don't have a level of precision they're you know the way that they work is to generate data that's like the data that they've seen there's no constraint on them that says that that has to actually correspond to anything in the real world you know if you ask it to give you a reference on some obscure topic it'll just fabricate you know and if you ask it to solve a math problem like it'll give you numbers but they'll be totally wrong right so even like a physics problem you know you ask it like you know i have a 100 gallon tank and you know it's flowing you know it has a hole in it and it's leaking water at a rate of one gallon per minute right how long is it going to take for that to drain that might be a useful question that somebody might want to actually answer and it just won't give you a right answer to that because it can't do it can't do the calculations um and so with math right all of that becomes possible there's a lot of things that are you know in in its level of understanding of the sciences and physics that rely on math that could be incredibly useful to lay people which are just not reliable sources of information right now all of a sudden you start including symbolic reasoning mathematics uh those all become much more reliable so i think that's maybe a good example yeah in a funny way a homework just got a lot easier for for kids probably but that's a whole other yeah there's a lot of things we need to figure out there probably another question though funny like we often get asked that question but then the next question will get asked which is so much more compelling is do you think that ai will solve a major problem like cancer or you know will it create something new in in physics right will it make a discovery in physics let's say and now that you know it it will have the ability to do mathematics do you think that that is possible that's a great question and i'll just say that like ai already has done that with protein folding i mean protein folding was a generational problem in science and i would argue that it is it was the most important unsolved problem in biology and now that we have the ability to just to give context on like what it mean like what does protein folding mean like we were basically completely in the dark as far as how the sequence of amino acids in your dna um or the sequence of nucleotides in your dna or the sequence of amino acids in a protein actually translated to how that protein functions right so we were unable to go from you know dna sequence to what does this protein do right how does it work how does it function and the thing is that how proteins function are basically entirely dependent on their shape right and so if you can take a sequence of amino acids or a string of dna and predict what the protein how the protein will fold the particular configuration space will take after it's been translated um you can figure out how that protein works and interacts with other proteins and interacts with other molecules and we were completely unable to do that now we know now we have the ability to do that and as a result so many diseases so many drugs can be synthesized so many you know we can really what is at the heart of biology is these are like nanom machines right now nanotechnology also gets supercharged and we have the ability to start building novel proteins that don't exist in nature that are built specifically for tasks that we want to perform right so this is a massive scientific breakthrough that's already been made by by deep learning now we can talk about mathematics as well i think it'll be a little while before you know because i think what we'll start with is oh like these systems will do like middle school level math but reliably and they'll be able to have like the language understanding right it's really the combination of all these things that's compelling but i think with the right data sets and time and scale they will start being able to do what i will call university level mathematics um and they will begin to understand how to do proofs and and the thing is is that even if they're 1% as efficient as a human researcher the level of scale that you have from these systems is so extraordinary you know you can just run millions of instances of these of these systems constantly at 100x the you know the rate of processing that a person would be able to i think there's a very real possibility that maybe not in 2025 but some years after we start making major advancements in mathematics with these systems it's not unrelated to systems like lean which are um automated proof solvers but i really think that there's going to be this integration between proof solvers um proof checkers really and systems like chbt with mathematical abilities that will really again turbocharge mathematics it's so exciting to think about that opportunity coming maybe sooner to your point earlier about you know 2025 2024 being that year with mathematics maybe sooner than people realize and i want to bring in some of your experience now with rain as well you think about this world that we're talking about the direction we're going it's going to require a lot of compute obviously um that's the other big thing aside from data and you know at rain you're obviously working on artificial brains you're trying to make compute more efficient how do you think about compute in the context of you know this incredible future that i think it feels like we're really on the cusp of you know but do we have enough infrastructure and and how does that need to change to deliver on this that's a great question so you know i think that right now we've hit a little bit of a plateau to be honest um and i i think that we've we've seen that happen and you know it rain we've seen it coming for a long time we weren't sure exactly when we were going to hit it but it seems that right now is you know the point where we've hit the the maximum to within an order of magnitude right you can only sustain exponential growth for so long and models were doubling every three and a half months yeah over the past you know six years that's got to come to an end at some point and we've essentially with the combination of mor's law ending you know gpus are no longer gain you know exponential price performance improvements and the data scale infrastructure that we've built is you know reached into the multiple billions of dollars and so you can't really scale these out by any you know certainly not like two more orders of magnitude um so the size of these systems is not going to keep accelerating like we've seen it in the past and so we we're not going to keep getting the gains that we've seen in the past however there was a um you know what i'll what i'll think of as a a major breakthrough in computation recently in hardware right and to put it into context um really the big limiting factor in hardware that we have right now it's really just the brains and gpus are nothing alike um right cpus and gpus they are built on the vanoyan architecture which is based around the separation of memory and processing and so like your memory like your ram right is located in one place and then your cpu or your alu or arithmetic logic units they are located in another another place right physical and the only only thing that connects them is a narrow bus right and in gpus maybe you have multiple copies of these but it's nothing like the parallelism that we have in the brain in the brain memory and processing are unified they're actually the same physical substrate and so this really expensive movement of data in the vanan bottleneck which is you know this is the memory wall essentially right moving data these networks are massive they require huge amounts of data so you have to move a ton of data from your memory into where the processing is located and that bottleneck is you know the reason why we need huge data center scale you know appliances to run relatively modest neural networks by biological standards right if we can break through this bottleneck um and do the computations inside the memory memory or significantly closer to where the memory is located that is going to give us order of magnitude improvements and that's going to break us out of this plateau that we've hit uh there are indications that um a major breakr has been made and it's not far away from commercialization and this is related to ram uh in particular d but if this pans out you know we may see in the next few years modern llms like chacha bt able to be run locally like on your cell phone without and people have tried putting llms on on cell phones and there are some papers around this but they're almost they're always like extraordinarily compressed versions they're not like the full scale model and so running full scale gp4 on your phone in a reasonable amount of time is just simply not possible right now but this breakthrough you know we're talking about like 500x improvements in energy efficiency and latency decrease and when you say running on the phone you're saying you're referring just to inference not talking about training that would be a totally different training will also be impacted by this by this um but yeah i'm i'm specifically referring to inference and i mean locally right you can get chat gbt on your phone but it has to talk to a server which then communicates with you and so you know this is what we refer to is like edge if you're if you're in a device that either doesn't have connection to the internet or is really latency sensitive and you know can't do um can't handle you know the few hundred milliseconds that it takes to transmit data to and from a data center a good example of this is like language real- time language translation in your ear if you have an earbud um and you're trying to automatically translate what somebody is saying to you in real time that delay the delay of talking to a data center essentially kills the application it makes it unusable same similar with like speech recognition like you talk to siri and then you know a few seconds later it gives you a response it it really degrades the quality of the interaction if you can run these models locally on the device you eliminate that and you get really crisp fast latencies with no delay and it stands to reason too if if we see a world where we have intelligent machines adaptive machines in the future don't they sort of need to be able to learn on the fly and that's going to have to happen on the edge not to your point sending stuff back and forth to a data center exactly like the cost of sending all of that data is really huge especially on like wireless devices you know sending data is really power intensive and you're burning a lot of data data is data transfer is expensive as well if you can keep that local to the device um you save huge amounts of power in data data transmission costs and also you do circumvent a lot of the issues with like privacy you know you're sending you don't want to be a lot of people don't want to be sending all of their data to google and you know facebook and amazon and these big companies um but yeah having your your data completely local is i think really beneficial um and we want these to we want these you know every time you talk to chat gbt it forgets everything that you've talked to with it about you know it forgets all of your all of your conversations the context window is only so long right and you don't want to load into context all of your past conversations like every time you want to have a conversation with it you want it to actually like learn you want its weights to change in it to actually learn and internalize its interactions with you i think um i think that's that's something that's important to people who are especially you know having i think there are a lot of especially like young people who are using these character creators and having conversations with with these ai systems and that gets that opens a whole other can of worms too but you know at least for your assistant you want it to be able to know you so yeah i mean to your point earlier about intelligence i mean intelligence is partially the ability to learn from things prior experiences things you've done before exactly yeah so what should we expect from rain in this context of what we're talking about over the next couple of years what's exciting coming yeah so on the immediate horizon you know i i mentioned this uh this memory wall or vono bob neck this idea that you know cpus and gpus they spend the vast majority of their time and energy simply just moving data between where the memory is stored and where the processing happens um at rain we're building a a processor that unifies memory and processing that does the computations inside the memory so that you can really dramatically reduce the amount of this data movement that contributes to latency and it contributes to power consumption and so our first products are going to be targeted towards edge devices so um relatively small like convolutional neural networks to do image processing like maybe you would run this in a drone or some other use case where you're power constrained like robots um and maybe you want to do speech recognition as well in a low power footprint so this is the type of chip that could be integrated into you know a vr headset or cell phone or something like that that could reduce the power consumption um and latency of running these types of computer vision models speech recognition models also we want to enable these devices to be able to do training right like there are a lot of cases where you know i'll give you an example for like drones um there are some companies out there who want to do like inspection of critical infrastructure in an automated fashion using drones so a lot of american infrastructure is not doing so great we want to be able to to repair and and monitor that infrastructure it's just really expensive because you have to have people go out and do this but if you can automate that you can improve the quality of the the infrastructure i think by quite a lot the problem is that you know when you train a neural network to do image processing right the the data that it trains on you know in the data center is invariably going to be different from the data that it sees in the real world and maybe this is just due to the fact that when you put a you know a camera on a drone it's a little shaky right or it's blurry because it's moving quickly or it's operating in the rain and it's you know not a lot of its data has been in the rain or there's blur or there's a you know water droplet on the camera or some dead pixels right all of these changes really degrade the performance of the image recognition system right but if you can have adaptation if you can build in the ability for the network for that chip to adapt to its environment in real time on the fly you can recover a lot of that accuracy and this sort of drop in accuracy from it's called domain shift between its training data and data that it's seeing in the real world um this is a big problem that limits applicability limits a lot of applications and so this is another thing that we're trying to solve is give these systems the ability to adapt to their data on the fly and try and prevent problems from domain shift but that's our immediate product you know we are working on bigger and better things as well um so i lead the frontier research division if rain and you know our goal is to build you know multiple order of magnitude more performance systems for significantly larger normal networks like transformer architectures llms eventually um and as i mentioned one of these breakthroughs in in dram i think is one of the keys to this you know there's others memory techn oles on the horizon like resistive ram and things like that that we're interested in but you know we're keeping our ear to the ground and seeing what innovations are popping up and incorporating those and developing our own innovations to power what i think is going to be the next like the real wave of commercialization of these systems because it requires vastly higher levels of computer efficiency right they're just too expensive computationally right now to really be too practical yeah what you're doing doing is is super important i mean i think that the software side gets so much attention because people can naturally use it and they can feel it and they've experienced chat gpt but in the reality is the brain is the hardware i mean that's really where it happens right i mean the models are are fun to think about and they're going to evolve a lot for our conversation today and very quickly but getting the hardware right and getting it in place and having it be efficient is i think underappreciated i completely agree i completely agree and we've seen you know we're maybe a a great new architecture will come out you know and will show us that you can get you know a thx improvements from model architecture alone but i mean just from what we see in the brain you know the brain has got like 100 trillion synapses i think 100 trillion parameters like i think that you know model architecture improvements can only get us you know one to two order of magnitudes worth of improvement um maybe 10 to 100x but hardware we are more like four to five maybe even six orders of magnitude away from biological brains in terms of actual hardware so there's many many more orders of magnitude more to be gained from hardware than architecture improvements and i think hardware you know changing the way that we do computation these processors doing computations inside memory being more more brain-like um i i think that's the future of ai absolutely well you guys are working on the right problem jack you're the right one to be leading the charge on it as well um this has been i think super enlightening just to think about where we're going and how fast we're going and then ultimately you know how rain plays into it so thanks for coming and talking with me today and i'm sure we will do this again because there's so much more to talk about yeah thank you so much doug really appreciate it and thanks for having me thanks all right
Frontier & Center: Roblox,2024-02-09 14:10:26+00:00,7,EVIm53AJKkQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVIm53AJKkQ,"welcome to deep tech 315 i'm jean mster along with doug clinton and this is where we talk about the three most important topics in tech in 15 minutes or less and the first topic is going to be apple and the quarter second we're going to talk about apple and their initiatives related to artificial intelligence and last we're going to talk about uh a presidential order related to some regulation around ai models and so we'll go back to the top the biggest news in tech this week of course is apple's earnings it's so big that we have to split it into two so we're going to first just talk about the the earnings itself and the guidance more specifically is that shares of apple were down about 1% and the conference call until their cfo talked about the december outlook and gave guidance that it would be flat year-over-year which was below analyst expectations that we're looking for 5% growth uh luca cfo mentioned that this year we have 14 qu uh 133 weeks in this december quarter compared to 13 last year and if we had uh equal number of weeks in this quarter it essentially would be up 7% so that would be higher than where the street is at so bottom line is there's some um i guess some concern or some uh lack of clarity in terms of how to really think about this guidance and my sense is that uh just look at it on a week over- week basis is that the all ultimately is that the business is growing about 7% a year right now and i think that that's a nice step up from the 1% decline that they just had in the september quarter so i put this guidance in a category where it actually was okay and i love your take doug i think it says probably more about just the environment in general i think there's a lot of concern in the investor community about anything that touches the consumer and we've heard a lot of commentary from a lot of different companies about consumer weakness um that's not necessarily something that seems to be playing out given what you're talking about when you make that adjustment for the weeks year to year um but i think the headline though is that apple got it down right and i think a lot of investors look at that that's all they pay attention to and they say look we know the consumer is starting to get hit with higher interest rates we're seeing it at other companies and it may just be people being jumpy around that i yeah i think it is yeah jumpiness and i think focusing on the wrong metric uh the metric one is they guided down that's the headline metric two is the business is actually growing year-over year and so uh they're really not seen much of it in uh you not seen much of a decline at all it's things are improving but i hear you who knows when that uh party ends with related to the consumer but apple seems to be uh continuing to buck the trend there's kind of a mix of other stuff in that quart in the quarter i'll just point out a couple other a couple other important points china was down a couple percent year-over-year uh that was it was up 8% in the in the june quarter and so we saw a slow down there but it was also down 7% in the march quarter of 2023 and so it's kind of all over the board uh tim cook said that they had gained share in the phone market in china so i don't think huawei is eating their lunch there and lastly the india opportunity of course came up it's growing fast but it's important to keep in mind that india the the per capita gdp is 1th that of uh what china is uh and kind kind of interestingly is that the us is five times higher than china to give you some perspective it's about $5,000 per person in india about 70,000 in the us and so yes india is a big opportunity but you got to put in the context of i think of gdp per person so we're going to wrap there with the the quarter and shift to some of the commentary related to ai and app apple and it's been a little bit of a disappointment i think if we look in context of what apple said about artificial intelligence over the last six nine months relative to what other big tech have been saying when the question came up on the earnings call cook was related to question specifically was about jaren of ai and cook quickly redirected to discussing how ai is kind of influencing their products and then he mentioned and i'm going to read the quote here he said that as far as in terms of general of ai we obviously have work going on and you can bet we are investing quite a bit and we are going to invest responsibly and so doug let's take forget about apple making their kind of inside their products better with ai what about generative ai what what form do you think it's going to take when apple eventually does show something the first thing that comes to mind is probably something around siri um you know i think that's that was really one of their first i think fourr where they were really aggressive with quote unquote ai and siri feels like you know just like alexa and google assistant has kind of fallen by the wayside and you know i remember five six years ago we all thought this was going to be this massive trend voice assistance really haven't played out i think the generative ai and actually having some real intelligence behind these models versus just you know this sort of very basic language understanding that the original assistants were built on that something that could be compelling and and new um i hope that's kind of like the first big product let's say um i'm sure we'll see you know some generative stuff peak its way into things like email texting that makes the most logical uh sense so uh for the viewers doug and i don't we don't discuss the topics we know which we're going to be talking about but we don't go in depth and so i had the same view it was related to to siri and you talked about you know just making it more intelligent kind of adding to email like what what actual form do you envision it taking is it you ask siri hey siri book me a a flight to salt lake city tomorrow is it uh eventually gets there um how else do you like what are some kind of tangible ways that you think siri can really be powered by generative ai or what would be the output it's a long path to get to booking a flight although i think that is the ultimate outcome and when we think about where the world is going kind of three five years out i think this idea of a personal ai that really understands you that knows your credit card information that knows your schedule that knows your email and your text which obviously apple has all this information with all their services that you're tied to with them i do think that's where we ultimately go but i think there's a trust layer that needs to be established you know people probably aren't immediately tomorrow going to want to go and say to siri book me a flight to salt lake city who's going to want to be uh sort of checks and balances on the way and you know the ai might ask you is this flight okay um so i think that that is the ultimate destination is a true personal assistant but i think the baby steps to get there are probably much more simpler things like can i help you compose an email or maybe you might say this to answer jean's text right something like that that's probably what we see before we get to that kind of holy grail of personal ai it's important to keep in mind too when we talking about sir we're not talking about like homepod i mean that may be one part of it but it's asking your phone to compose a you know get back to doug via text on my calendar something like that you mentioned something personalized ai you've written a lot about that i think that uh that is a holy grail for ai usage and i think apple's best position just given kind of their position related to security and privacy and uh would you agree with that you think that it doesn't matter it's the wild west when it comes to data uh does apple have a potential hand a leg up long term when it comes to generative ai and personalized ai for personal day i i do think they might um because again i think trust is such a key component to ultimately whoever wins that personal ai battle google is right there with them you know amazon all the big tech companies essentially maybe you exclude meta from that given some of their issues of privacy in the past um so i think all of big tech is probably right there neck and neck the question really is who has probably the most powerful model and right now we don't really know what apple has you know we've seen a lot of uh work from google in particular we've seen microsoft partner with open ai we know who they're working with amazon has a lot that they put out to market and so apple still do wild card and i think that's why you know you bring up the idea that they finally talked about they they acknowledge the existence of ai because they've sort of been avoiding talking about it even though they use it in products we all know that but i think they need to unveil a little bit more about what they're doing so that the world understands that they're uh maybe not super far behind the rest of their yeah they got to be doing that i mean the yeah i think that they're going to do that and i would guess that that would be a positive relative to what investors are thinking today so uh we got think investors care like if they start talking more about generative ai it doesn't feel like it has the same lift to the multiple maybe that it has for microsoft or google doesn't have the same lift but i think if they started seeing what's going on in services growth that was up 16% accelerating from 8% last quarter they investors see that people get these devices they find more ways to make money from them and i think if they started talking about personalized ai i think that they the outlook of the services business would be more favorable and i think that uh that would be pos pos not the same as microsoft nvidia but i think it it direction would be positive relative to where people's heads are at today we're going to st has felt like the strongest part of the whole quarter yeah that was makes sense uh impressive and best profitability uh 45% gross margins but well we're going to go to the final topic which is related to an executive order from the white house that is going to be kind of dictating how some of these models are are are going to be like um i don't know built or how consumers are going to work with these models so can you bring everybody up to speed i'm not as familiar with what's going on with this one yes the white house issued an executive order about it's got a very long title but it has to do basically with the uh safety of development in artificial intelligence and what it does is it invokes the defense production act which basically says that any company that generating a model that is of national interest so a security interest public health uh health and safety interest they sort of need to touch base with the government um and go through a process where they're doing what's called red teaming the model which is sort of making sure that the model doesn't do anything inappropriate that it's not supposed to do and there'll be a red teaming process that uh an agency in the government will kind of help establish and work with these companies all these companies that are building generative ai models and sort of foundational models have already verbally agreed to a prior white house accord to sort of do all these things so what the news is here and what's new is that it's actually tied now to a specific act specific legislation um and it's got a little bit more substance and teeth to it than sort of self-regulation we've seen so far in the ai community do you think what happened in social and kind of how that got away from the government do you think that's impacted how they're approaching ai maybe a little i think there's also you know the uk has had some uh events around ai i think they have uh a summit that they're sort of doing this week as well i feel like part of the timing of this may also have something to do with the us wanting to feel like a leader and seem like a leader around the world in terms of trying to be first to have some real framework in place which again to date it's been i think having a lot of these companies sort of just be aware that the government's thinking about it there's been a lot of activity on capitol hill bringing all the leaders in ai together and sort of talking about what policy should be um but this is really the first piece of action we've seen and i think we'll probably hear a lot more about it in the presidential race in 2024 yeah definitely i'm glad to hear it i'm a small government kind of guy but happy to hear that they're playing a role in this because i just think ai is going to be that potent that there should be some rails on it uh what's your take good idea here bad idea for ai i'm sort of mixed the um the idea that we should regulate ai i think makes a lot of sense i think there are kind of puts and takes um around that number one there's sort of this i think existential question which is really worth asking which is there's a race to get to uh artificial general intell ence and what people may assume becomes super intelligence between the us you know the west and essentially china and maybe russia to a lesser extent um i think it's in the world's best interest that the west gets there before china and obviously more regulation makes it harder to get further down the line in terms of agi um i think that's just a fact that's the point of regulation it it should be to kind of slow and limit what you can do so i think we have to be really careful about that and recognize that race at the same time obviously i think we do want to have some sort of oversight and it should ultimately come from the government i don't think that self-regulation um probably is enough to prevent the ultimate cat catastrophic outcome that could happen so i do think we need policy makers to step in but i do think there's an issue there too which is i think there's a severe knowledge gap like understanding how these models work at any meaningful level is pretty technical and i don't know if our policy makers really have enough knowledge there they really have to rely on the experts that they're regulating to guide them and help them to figure out what to do and so you kind of get into this catch that is crazy catch 22 yeah that that i don't know what the right answer is i think this is a step i don't know if it's the right step that red team is that what you talked about a red team red teaming yeah you try to go break the model basically i was hope that the red i i'm going to be uh rest well tonight knowing that the red teamers are not the politicians so we got like people actually understand this stuff being on the red team uh thanks for enlightening us uh thank you for taking 15 minutes and joining doug and i on behalf of deep tech 315 that's doug i'm jean and bye for now"
DeepTech315: Gemini / Meta's AI / AI Market,2024-02-09 19:23:56+00:00,13,PSFVdearT-4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSFVdearT-4,[music] welcome to this week's episode of frontier and center where we talk about frontier tech and benchmarking frontier tech and separately about a highlighted company within the deep waterer frontier tech etf that ticker is l so we'll start with how we're doing year to date that benchmark and we use the l etf as the benchmark for frontier tech more broadly frontier tech are those smaller tech companies that are changing how we live our lives over the next 3 to 5 years and year-to dat l is up 10.4% that compares to the nasdaq which is up 88.4% and compared and for since inception which is summer of 2018 is up 84% notably is as i mentioned these are smaller tech companies than that so this outperformance relative to the nasdaq as a benchmark is notable because uh the etf does not have the mega cap tech companies this breathtaking move in nvidia is not within that and yet the etf is outperforming uh the nasdaq which i think speaks to the opportunity that is starting to emerge related to some of this transformative tech so that's the benchmark update now we're going to shift to talk about one of the companies within it and the company this week is block if you haven't heard of block highly likely you have heard of square which was the former name of the company jack dorsy when he shifted to spending all of his time there changed the name to block because i think he wanted to focus more on blockchain but here we are a ticker sq as in cr quebec and the company's name is block a little bit confusing i wish they would line that up neither here nor there what is important is this is a $46 billion company so it does have a meat on it and is at the center of disrupting fintech specifically the payments systems and so uh the way they do that is they have two businesses on one side the square business i call i refer to the they're retail business uh this is what you likely know when you go to a small merchant and you pay with square this is at point of sale they have a small hardware piece but most of that revenue comes from transactions but they also have a platform that's used by those retailers for doing like hr and payments uh payroll for example and so you don't need to be brick and mortar to be a square customer so that's one side of the business that's about 60% of revenue on the other side is their cash app so that's about 40% of revenue they have about 55 million users they're grew at about 10% year-over year in the december quarter and so this is for think of venmo on steroids not just peer-to-peer but uh you can do everything from purchase stocks to a savings accounts to um buying crypto and so think of this as the kind of the bank of millennial is their cash app so you have the two sides of the business the square business and the cash app business business and that uh leads us to a point where we need to pause the conversation when we talk about their business and bring insert how they did the december quarter because it's relative to why this is part of the etf and in the december quarter uh the bottom line is the company made progress on its profitability about a year or so ago like many tech companies they announced that they were going to be reducing headcount they did that and they started to see some of the benefits of that in the december quarter with some upside so while the business is going to grow and 2024 at about 15% they're getting operating margin and operating income growth faster and they use uh the framework to manage the business is a profit focused framework and so they refer to it as the rule of 40 and the rule of 40 is basically uh adding together operating income growth plus adjusted eaab margin operating income growth plus adjusted ebit do margin and those two combined their goal is to get them to equal 40 and right now that number is 29 so they've got some work to go they think they can get to that 40 in calendar 2026 and so making progress to it but they aren't there and the way they want to get there is essentially combining all of the momentum that they have in the cash app with all this historical strong business that they have within the square retail and how they do that is by encouraging people to use their cash cash app at point of sale and as a quick reminder when you purchase things at point of sale there is a hand that is invisible it's in between yourself and the transaction which of course is the payment providers this would be like american express master card visa and they take let's say on average 3% what block wants to do is by a user one of those 55 million users coming into a retail location or going online and and using the cash app they essentially want to cut out that credit card company cut out that 3% and take that 3% and somehow divide it up one opportunity is to give the customer a percent or 2% or maybe 3% off another opportunity is not to give the customer any uh discount but to keep all the money themselves or share some with the retailer but basically there is this 3% jump ball that they want to get their hands on that ultimately could be a large source of revenue and the part that again is appealing to us is these networks that have been placed these payment networks for so long have the opportunity be disrupted when you bring in something like a cash app and combine it with what they have built at point of sale those two even though they operate as separate businesses largely today can come together to basically create this unlock around that 3% of the transaction fee and so that's the holy grail is to slowly unlock that piece and that should further accelerate uh where the company's goal to that rule of 40 one last piece related to block is jack dorsy of course he is a legend and he had traditionally been splitting his time between bl and twitter obviously that twitter piece is now gone he's been focusing on bl for more than a year and i think that that is one of these secret uh assets they not so secret but an important asset to the investment gaze here is just dory's involvement so that's block in a nutshell and that's this week's episode of frontier and center i'm jean bye for now
Frontier & Center: Take-Two,2024-02-14 22:27:24+00:00,6,jxwA3LMxryU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxwA3LMxryU,welcome to deep tech 315 that's doug i'm jean this is our final episode of 2023 all eyes are on 2024 which is a great segue for our topic today which is our top picks our predictions for 2024 these are the firm predictions and we have 11 of them that we published this week we're going to talk about three of them that are most relevant and doug we're going to kick it off with a prediction basically that the mid and small cap is going to outperform the magnificent 7 the magnificent 7 had quite a magnificent year in 2023 up an average 115% if you remember that uh fang this now pass a fang there was up about 85 88% in 2023 but the mag 7 obviously within nvidia there and tesla having big years in 2023 really powered that higher and our prediction here really is that that momentum on the mag 7 isn't going to carry the market and specifically is that uh the iwo the i shares russell 2000 which is basically mid and small cap is going to outperform the s&p 500 and so i feel like we've had this belief that there's going to be a fracturing of fang and it just never happen happens but here we are again with the prediction that 2024 is going to be the year we're going to see out performance with some of these smaller companies it feels dangerous because in some ways it almost feels consensus it feels like everybody sort of feels like nvidia and facebook and tesla these companies are up 100 200 300% uh in the last year how could they keep going and so that's the only thing that worries me about that prediction is is everybody already there i mean the russell 2000 in the last two months it's up 25% and so we've already had a pretty rapid rally in that segment can it keep going in 24 maybe it's felt like it's kind of been a consensus market the last year if you if you overthink things a little too much like when tech started working at the beginning of this year if you overthought it you missed this incredible rally maybe the same thing is true for small and mid my sense one of the reasons why i was on board with this prediction is that i believe that uh i don't know what rates are going to do next year but i do not believe that they're going to go higher i think that a stable rate environment and this is contrarian i believe that a stable even a stable rate environment is going to be positive for some of these small and midcap companies and you could build a case that if rates don't go down like the market thinks that's negative for these but it's been such um a rough road over the last couple years for a lot of these companies they've ripped like you've said in the last couple weeks but many of them are still down 60 70% from where their highs were in 20121 and the highs don't make the stock it's that's the rear mir throw that out you got to look going forward what these businesses ultimately are going to earn over the next two three four years but uh from my perspective i actually am optimistic that the contr or the consensus call here is that the small and mid is going to outperform i think that is the right call here and that's our first prediction so uh we're going to jump to one a prediction that many people don't know and maybe we can take and do a two-minute teaching doug in your labs think of doug as like the mad scientist at deep water always testing always working on new products many of those products uh we don't uh currently have available but one that you've been doing a lot of work in is using artificial intelligence to build portfolios and uh this tell us a little bit about the project that you've been working on and the prediction that we have here i believe that experimentation is the truest form of curiosity and so if you really want to understand something you kind of have to actually do it i don't think you can just read about it and so my efforts to try to understand ai how it works i've been building stock portfolios i call the broader project intelligent alpha uh with generative ai tools so i use chat gpt bard and claude the three of them as basically an ai powered investment committee and i've created almost 40 different sort of unique portfolios at this point that i'm tracking two of which we are running live within deep water right now a large cap concentrated tech strategy that's actually beating the nasdaq by a thousand basis points so 10 percentage points since inception and then we had what was inception doug inception and that one was in uh october october 1st for that okay so we got three months u i mean crushing the indexes that one that's correct and then we have a long short strategy which i think is is very unique uh it uses ai to pick kind of 30 favorite names long 30 least favorite names short very inspired by julian robertson's idea at tiger of buy the best company short the worst companies and that one's beating the barkley hedge long short index by about 200 basis points and change as well so ai has been doing great and so as we look into 2024 as i mentioned we have about 40 strategies i've sort of created here so far 85% of them inception to date inception goes back in many cases to july so about six months of data 85% of them right now are beating benchmarks and i predict in 2024 the majority of these intelligent alpha strategies will continue to beat their ben benchmarks so i'm glad we're doing this experimentation i do wonder what does that mean for our roles as active managers at deep water we've got several actively managed products and how does i mean if these keep these ai products keep beating un and i what does it mean for humans in asset management means we might be out of jobs is the simple answer i mean i think that the future of stock picking really will be about ai traditional fundamental bottoms up kind of stock picking i do think that humans have a different understanding still when we think about what is the difference between ai and humans how do they think differently i think humans still have a different understanding about social phenomena so i actually think where humans can drive the most alpha over the next three to five years is understanding bubbles understanding things that are driven more by psychology and less by fundamentals and finding ways to to invest in those bubbles and generate alpha in those bubbles it's really hard to do that well because everybody gets caught up when things go crazy but i do think that's where humans will still have an edge at least in the nearer term versus ai for sure and as we think about that bubble piece to it it's uh i think some of our commentary has been a little bit misunderstood in the marketplace is that we're believers that we're going to go into an ai bubble when you say bubble i think people's reaction sometimes is this is negative it's going to be ugly and uh that ultimately maybe the part of the the trajectory through a bubble is a blow up on the other side of it but the runup and uh from the front half of that bubble is really juicy and that's what gets me excited about investing and and ultimately the next three to five years we've talked about this being 1995 going into 2000 and we're think we're going to go into a bull market for the next three to five years really powered by ai and so we'll obviously talk more about that on a weekly basis but um excited to hear um i'm excited about this the outlook here and one last one last thought or just one other thought on the bubbles i think that sometimes people uh as you said misunderstand when you talk about bubbles either they get really excited about the mania because they think they can get rich fast or they get really excited about the blowup because they're inherent skeptics and i think forget all that forget both sides of that this is the reality of a bubble they're a natural phenomena and in fact i argue and i've i've written a lot about this i actually think bubbles are a required part of any profound technological revolution and i think ai is the most profound technological revolution humanity has ever had and so if you believe that anytime you get these new paradigm shifting groundbreaking technologies that they have to come with bubbles they have to come with the excitement of what this new thing can do for the world and all the money that chases that well then you could argue that ai might be the biggest bubble of them all at least so far whatever comes next who knows but being ready for that and not just saying well i want to play and get rich fast in the runup or i can't wait for this thing to blow up because i'm tired of talking about ai i think that's the wrong perspective i think you need to step back and just say what is really true about technological innovation why do they create bubbles and then have a thesis about what's the smart way to play that getting in and out at the right time love it we'll be uh navigating that dynamic which gets us to our last topic here which is tesa will maintain their ev market share tesla will maintain their ev market share in 2024 now this one is controversial um that just the simple math about way market shares play out would suggest that their market shar is going to continue decline so just to take four steps back and from 2015 call it to 2019 tesla basically had all the us ev market share that's now come down to call it 58% over the past couple years as more automakers traditional automakers have stepped up and started to come up with their own evs and when you have such a high market share and you have more competition coming in naturally the market share is going to decline the general thinking is that eventually tesla's going to reach something like 10 or 15 or 20% us market share a long way down from the current uh call it 30 or call it 60% share today and the reason why i believe that uh this is going to they're going to be able to maintain their share is for two uh points number one is i think one thing that that benefits fitted traditional automakers in 2023 there's actually a lot of penup demand in 2020 2021 2022 for people who loved their brands their volvo their bmw their toyota and they wanted an electric alternative these were people who are holding back on buying a new car they got that option they purchased those cars in 20203 tesla's share dropped and i think that this next wave for traditional auto gain share is going to require more of these um more models from traditional automakers more options and i don't think we're going to see it in 2023 we may see a a few more models but relative to what we saw from 22 to 23 the increase in uh competitors to tesla on the us from 23 to 24 is going to be modest and i still believe that tesla has the best bang for the buck and so putting all this together i'm going out on a limb and saying that tesla's going to maintain their their share right around of right around high 50% most uh people believe that it's going to end up somewhere between 45 and 50 so just to give you some context there but um this by the way another piece we have another prediction relative to the ev market we think it's going to be generally a challenging year in evs in 2024 kind of 25% overall growth that's in line with consensus for where tesla's at and would be a step down from the 50% growth in 2023 for the overall market but uh ultimately we think that this sets up for a strong ev market in 2025 a re acceleration of 35% plus growth so putting it all together the what's the punchline i believe that tesla is going to maintain their ev market share it's going to be a fun one to watch and um i think we we can uh wrap there and uh do want to make a a quick comment relative to how we did last year uh we had a pretty good year last year doug on our predictions we had 10 predictions we have 11 this year uh we went either eight and a half or nine out of ten depending on how you count those predictions and we're not going to go through them all check out the our blog post uh and i'm excited that uh we have room to improve uh nine out of 10 is not 10 out of 10 uh so let's make it 11 out 11 this year let's do it all right on behalf of doug jean and deep tech 315 bye for now and happy new year
DeepTech315: Altman's $7T Proposal / Quest vs Vision Pro / Intelligent Alpha,2024-02-14 22:41:58+00:00,15,akh3g_I0KUI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akh3g_I0KUI,[music] welcome to pressure points i'm jean mster our topic today is open ai dev day that took place a couple days ago the significance of it is meaningful and given we're going to be talking about this for months to come it is still relevant to have a conversation about what the key takeaways were and before we get into it i want to mention i along with most people who are following the storyline agree that open ai is the most exciting tech company that is a high bar in my book given i think of things like apple and what they're doing with vision pro and spatial computing which will be out marchish of next year what tesla is doing with autonomy which will be out let's say marchish of 2026 and ultimately if anything comes out of optimus prime we'll call that 2030 but what is unique about what openi is doing those products and innovations are happening today so that's why it reaches the criteria for pressure points and before we get into the three pressure points i want to mention too is that after the event there's been some criticism of jet gbt relative to hallucinations and these of course are relatively common amongst generative ai they happen anywhere from 10 to 20% of the queries you'll get some noise in the data and my sense is well it makes good theater in the near term it really doesn't matter in the long term in one three or 5 years from now these models are going to become so much more advanced the frequency of hallucinations will be insignificant and so i'm able to look past those and look at what the three pressure points were from the dev uh a day and the first was chat gpt builder and this is available today this basically allows people who are less technical to build uh interactive to build a generative chat bot and the idea is the last n months months most of the action around what's going on with chatbots has been from larger companies that have more advanced developers and what uh gbt um builder will allow is for less technical people maybe even regular people to do this and they demoed it and it had an interface that was drag and drop or check a box that allows you to relatively easy train a model off of a a document that you may have and they basically create and then you would add that model to a website the use case maybe think of a company that maybe sells cleaning supplies and they have questions that they get from people about how to get different kinds of stains out today they they message with a person through a bot this these smaller companies may not have the resources to build a big chatbot like chlorox mite but they can do this now by just essentially training the bot off of a manual that the regular people are using to today exciting opportunity really to add more generative bots to the masses the second was gpt store and the idea here is that open ai is going to have a platform where you can download code typically it' be like a link that you'd insert in a website and you'd pay for that and then open ai would take a revenue cut and the developer takes the cut and i haven't been able to figure out what the revenue split is but my guess is it's going to be more favorable to the developer than what apple has talked about just because they tend to be more opening eye tends to be more developer friendly and so i think that uh that is important in itself but beyond the idea that they're opening up a app store again this is mostly going to be for browser based beyond that i think it it begs a bigger question which is what is openi going to do in the hardware space and just like when apple came out with the phone and then later came out with the app store to really unlock the value of the phone i think there's an opportunity for cat gpt to come out with these models and then also follow up with some hardware whether it's a phone or a computer a tablet or even licensing some of the ability to interact with their their bots to other devices a refrigerator a toaster a car to be able to license that similar to what apple did with a made for ey program that ability is a new revenue opportunity for open ai and i want to also stress that i don't see open ai wanting to compete directly with apple i could see them coming out with a phone a computer a tablet as i mentioned but i don't think that they want to dominate the market share this is a similar road map doug clinton from deep water and i were just discussing this this opportunity for companies like open ai to do take a page out of google's book when they came out with nexus this was even before the pixel to try to really drive the show the best case the hero case around what a phone could do show samsung what they can do i think open ai has an opportunity to do that later so the second pressure point is related to the store cgpd store and what that ultimately means for what open may do in hardware and the third was epiphany mike olssen from our team had when we were watching the dev day and at one point there was a demo for this work automation tool zapier and the woman that was demoing uh the the the product showed uh she was on a mac and she was inside a google chrome browser and that was connected to azure and running a cat gpt uh chatbot and it just dawned on us like uh snap that frame like this is how you invest in an ai today essentially these big companies i mean their grip that they've had on us for the last 10 plus years it's already starting and already early when it comes to ai and so i think those companies are well positioned deep water uh we do own google and uh that i think there's just an opportunity for these big companies to continue like it or not to have an outsized benefit at least in the near term when it comes to ai so those are the three pressure points from dev day it's a lot of fun and this is a topic that's going to keep giving so we'll be back reporting more on it on behalf of deep water i'm jean bye for now
Pressure Points: Nvidia Earnings Preview,2024-02-15 15:50:33+00:00,9,EjFvuq1ysKU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjFvuq1ysKU,welcome to deep tech 315 i'm jean along with doug and our three topics this week are microsoft ignite developer day second is open ai pausing the gpt plus subscriptions and third is redwood materials new deal new partnership with toyota and so doug will jump right in with microsoft ignite this is their annual uh developers day pretty fun stuff uh to follow along there is a lot in there and my general thought was what first popped out to me was the announcement around silicon and at the just before the event started they talked about doing their own specific silic and their own cpus and i think we knew this was coming there were some reports about them building a chip they've been working on a chip for i believe it was four years was the last report i saw so uh this shouldn't have been unexpected we already know google has tpus amazon has inferium and tranium chips uh so it should be expected and i think one thing that i've been saying uh a lot as it relates to ai superpowers like a microsoft like an amazon like a google if you're a company that's really focused on ai and you have a market cap over a hundred billion dollars you have to make your own chips you have to look at designing your own chips because the efficiencies you get for building chips that are purpose-built to handle your algorithms will give you advantages it will give you cost advantages and so nvidia is great doesn't mean they're going to get away from nvidia but it does mean that they're going to build silicon specifically tailored to the applications that they are running in the azure data centers so yeah this the whole spectrum around chips when you think about these data centers this infrastructure there's a lot there as a recap the way nvidia tells the story is that we've been a cpu focused compute stack for the last 40 50 years we're going to move to gpus they're better suited for ai but to build these infrastructure structures you kind of need them both and i believe microsoft was these specific chips they refer to them as cpus is that correct there were actually two chips there was the maya uh 100 that was an ai accelerator chip so that will be specifically for ai and then they also had a chip that is a cpu that would it would compete with more of like an intel type product uh where you're using cpus in in the data center instead of a gpu so when i saw the announcement i thought it makes sense like you said is this has been rumored for these companies to be doing this but it kind of lays the groundwork to microsoft moving to a world where they don't do as much with nvidia and amd and i think that's a that seemed like a reasonable takeaway five years from now they're going to be doing less with amd and intel or amd and uh nvidia potentially i think it's it's going to be hard for them to get away from them entirely though and i mean you think about the structure of the conversation uh for sati nadella's keynote he talked about amd specifically he talked about their mi 300 chip which is their new ai accelerator um they said that they have that now running in azure data centers and they're going to be rolling it out more next year and he also brought jensen wang on stage from nvidia and so i think the partnerships are still really strong with nvidia and amd i think all of the hyperscalers do want to have their own chips to yes diversify some of their reliance on these big makers but also i think it comes back to that specificity it comes back to uh that efficiency that you get having chips purpose-built to run the algorithms that you're serving to your customers doesn't mean the accelerated compute theme that nvidia talks about is going away or that they aren't still the king player um but it does mean that microsoft will make sure that they have chips again purpose built for what they're trying to do i think that whole jensen joining stage it was masterful on m microsoft's part to bring them on stage remind me of the when apple announced itunes for the motorola rocker and bringing i think that the d the motorola ceo on stage with steve jobs obviously mik apple's moving in a different direction i don't think this is the same case where they're just going to knock them out but i think the big picture here for me is that these big tech companies the hyperscalers want to do more silicon themselves microsoft referred to as silicon diversity but either way you cut it uh nvidia's got more demand than they can keep up with so that's one of the reasons why uh we've uh recently bought um a tai when hee semi tsm to kind of play up with some of that demand the other parts that have kind of impacted on the ignite event was related to just kind of more partnerships and they also ended with a kind of this little teaser video about using co-pilot voice with what looked like how lens they showed some people doing like an industrial kind of technical work and using like an updated version of how lens it looked like and u that caught my attention because of course i'm a big believer in spatial computing what apple's doing and i thought here we go like now microsoft is on board with this i logically we've always sort of assumed when we think back to like siri for example that voice is sort of the most natural interface and i think the problem with voice historically is that we were talking to machines that weren't really that intelligent you know we're were talking to really lowlevel uh machines that could understand like basic commands but if you think about what gpt has kind of opened up to be able to converse with a human in the the dynamic range of basically asking it any question that you might ask it that means that there is this sort of underlying understanding that siri you know never had that google assistant never had and that to me is what's different now if you bring that natural language you bring that voice control and you pair that to these foundational large language models that's an exciting new world where you do have a machine that can understand a very wide range of requests and then ultimately act on them and the but the integration of having a wearable a hardware around this a headset and kind of integrating with that that seems to me like a pretty big unlock i mean that's 2016 is when hollow lens came out and we following this we bought follow lens as a developer kit back in the day and we're playing around with it but i feel like that vision is finally coming into focus it is yeah i mean you see other products like the humane pin we talked about that before you know that just launched this week uh same thing i think the same idea this idea of how can you uh pair the understanding of the world that these llms bring with different interfaces whether it might be voice whether it might be gestures or other things obviously they're going to be incorporate at in these devices too um i think it does i i agree with you i think it does unlock another layer as it relates to spatial computing and ar i think it's still uh the question for me is still what is that really killer use case we still have not seen that yet and i think that's what we need to answer before that really breaks out initial killer use case is a spatial video but that's going to be just the starting point we'll talk more about that undoubtedly as we get ready for uh vision proos launch likely in march of next year we'll shift to the next topic which is open ai pausing jet tpt plus signups after their dev day here i was able to sign up about two hours before they did the pause on it and sounds like things were off to a little bit of a a rocky start when it came to some of the reliability i think what it was from from my personal experience at least is a lot of people were probably trying to create gpts so obviously gpts or one of the other big announcements uh a week before before the microsoft conference open ai dev day and gpts let you basically sort of custom tune your own chatbot g i've created exactly exactly um so i've created a handful of them and it's super easy to do you can you can make it as simple or as complex as you want yeah let me let me pause you there dog is that to me is they took some those technical and it is super easy that that's the best way to describe it but keep going yeah you just give it some basic guardrails or or parameters and some data and you've got you've got kind of a custom tune gpt and it can be minutes literally minutes if you haven't tried it yet and i think probably what was happening was so many people were trying and creating these gpts and then sharing them you know i posted mine online in a few places uh it's basically a version of what i call intelligent alpha a stock picking gpt um and what i saw even using it myself was it would break very frequently and it wasn't because there was an issue with how i created the gpt it was because open ai servers were apparently getting overloaded and i think a lot of other people were having sort of the same experience and so what we saw from sam mman was you know look it lo it felt like the user experience was not living up to what they wanted it to be because of some of these reliability issues i think bigger picture though it just speaks to what we're talking about before with microsoft i mean infrastructure nvidia you know there's still a huge need for more compute here and that's not going to go anyway uh anytime soon as a reminder uh alman did talk about a 100 million weekly active gpt users probably a billion people have tried it but that's a powerful number and i'm sure that number's going up here given what they've recently announced with gpt builder and so uh we will uh continue to to keep track i'm just i'll just add you talked about what you used it for i built one that helps with editing uh notes and also giving recommendations for titles and key takeaway points from some of the notes that we published and then about two minutes later i built another gpt that answers questions about the transition from electric to or from gas to electric which gets us to our final topic today which redwood materials they're a private company last valuation was just over $4 billion this of course is jb strobel's uh battery recycling and components company deep water is invested in this company and they announced a deal with toyota where toyota is going to be purchasing some of the recycled materials ano cathode and some of the metals from redwood to put into new batteries that they're producing in their north carolina battery facility that they're starting to build and this is unique because they've have redwood has a previous relationship with toyota to recycle prius batteries some of those have been around for 20 plus years and and so this is a true life cycle of a battery relationship they have first company uh that uh i'm aware of that redwood's aware of to to do this and just kind of an exciting confirmation which one of the reasons why we like the company is this this ability to be kind of this this cycle true cycle of uh of of managing and optimizing the battery life and i think for evs to really meet their full potential we have to have recycling as part of that component you know if if the long-term story with evs is we're still pulling lithium and cobalt out of the ground you know i think i think the skeptics would be fair to argue is this really any better and any more sustainable than using gasoline and petroleum we pull out of the ground and so i think this is a critical component and it's still early in the recycling uh paradigm but companies like redwood are are a critical uh i think cog in the long-term ev story it makes sense that toyota was this partner because what they've done with redwood at the prius there was one piece of me that a little bit surprised because i think toyota's been one of the companies that has been most um maybe levelheaded about the pace of transition from gas to electric and not even saying that we're necessarily going to go to electric that we may go to other forms whether it's solar vehicles or hydrogen powered vehicles and so that that kind of caught my attention but uh i think that the bigger picture is from my perspective is that first this this this loop that effectively this uh manufacturing loop that redwood has created it's evidenced by the relationship with toyota and and separately is despite all the negativity we've heard about evs recently the trend is still moving in that direction and i think toyota too i mean you could think of them obviously as the leaders in hybrids i mean they were really the company who put hybrids on the map and so even though they don't have uh maybe a strong lead or good heritage in in fully electric vehicles right now i think they have a great heritage in terms of being thoughtful about how do we incorporate electric as a power source in the vehicles right on score one for toyota and redwood and score another episode for doug and i deep tech 315 and we'll see you next week
Pressure Points: Nvidia Earnings,2024-02-22 01:05:31+00:00,8,iqGCicraz1Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqGCicraz1Q,i'm joe clinton managing partner and co-founder at deepwater asset management and this is the deload podcast where i review builders and founders of frontier technology companies that are shaping where the world is going today i speak with aaron ginn aaron is the ceo and co-founder of hydro host which is a deep water portfolio company hydra provides software to data center operators to help them manage their inventory and get compute to customers that need it today aaron and i talk about the wild demand that's happening right now in the gpu markets because of ai how many developers may be able to use less powerful gpus than they might think and ultimately how hydra is helping solve the ai compute dilemma and now here is aaron ginn all right aaron thanks for joining us uh you're going to be a really fun person to talk to you because you are in sort of the eye of the storm of this crazy uh race defined accelerated compute and find access to gpus um so let's start at the the beginning at the basics you run a company called hydra tell us what hydra does uh yeah yeah thanks for having me doug uh so we started hydra uh uh a couple years ago with the premise of like how do we actually create a more a universalized agnostic framework that allow people to move workloads between different types of nodes and those nodes would be like hosting providers like amazon google to digitalocean and so we landed on was the fact of like at the cloud layer that there were a lot of limitations within the virtualized world that in hosting that created all these like lock-in effects and that actually in light of the things that were happening in the market and also what was happening on the data center parametal side that that value prop of like agnosticism and into being able to be node independent was mostly going to be impacting high performance compute and that those types of people will actually not gravitate towards cloud actually gravitating towards data centers and us spending money on metal and creating their own sort of collocation network so we shifted uh the the framework and the customer type last year and we've been basically building out you more or less could say like an airbnb for colo or colo on demand and so we've been working uh with directly with oems and also data centers to build out various types of of high performance computing frameworks for customers and and we've been pretty successful there in getting a lot of traction and so what we provide actually is the software layer it actually enable companies to access data centers much easier ambassador so similar to what you would go see in amazon and having the whole gui nice framework we actually do that for data centers uh but we're actually completely agnostic so we're at the data center of virginia data center in sweden or iceland or london using the same api the same terraform provider uh the same uh the same ways you pay the bill like all universal framework and all security networking is done in the same place uh so if you've ever actually have built a colo or worked in a data center that's pretty amazing because you're we have simplified provisioning down to as easy as is to get access to aws but you get all the advantages of bare metal uh in all of the um uh the flexibility the security and any sort of the additional sides what you need on the networking and clustering uh you get all that access but have the same simplicity and ease of use as you see on public cloud yeah i mean you've hit kind of the the perfect place right place right time kind of thing and i know in one of your recent investor updates you talked a little bit about how some of these providers uh data center providers have tried to create their own software layer to maybe do what you guys do why do you think they haven't been successful or able to do that yeah well again because it's sort of like uh this use a different metaphor but like tesla versus like the other car companies right uh is that tesla is like is it actually in the business of like hardware or is in the business software right it's in the business of ux it's in the business of software like it's a same with apple right like the apple is in the business of ux it's not in the business of like making devices right it's how the device interconnects right which is why i mean android is like way beyond like uh an individual apple device now right in terms of like individual specs and individual hardware features and and so that's what refocusing on is actually building this sort of ux component because data centers are like car manufacturers right they like they're into real estate they're into metal they're into like racks yeah so so the whole sort of package of like how you actually access those things uh a lot of companies uh platform companies have outsourced that to cloud uh yeah but in terms of this next phase of computing particularly the limitations within public cloud and like how they design their networking uh they're not really set up to like take advantage of this next wave assuming other different things happen with the nvidia and intel and other things that are going down the pipe if that continues to go to this trajectory you're going to see actually a modularization of like particularly ai that is going to be this forcing function uh to where like it's going to force themselves into a hybrid environment uh so so cloud's been basically pretty stale in terms of like actually growth trajectory uh comparatively it's just a huge cash flow generator and the metering that you actually get from public clouds actually really high like we're not talking about like amazon isn't making you know one percent or two percent like stripe on the transactions right it's making 30 40 margins right uh and so you you see this movement away mainly because of the needs of high performance computing is actually really accelerating this uh because you just can't do what you want to do within clustering within if we're saying uh and training that you can get in in public cloud like because what you need is is the network density uh and you need to have customizations in that like public cloud is not designed for that and they've also been using different types of unique chips uh within their hardware that actually make it much more difficult to do rather than doing a fresh install at like a new data center uh you know with a with a nvidia rack you know uh like like legitimately like no video rack like in terms of you want like the most advanced uh h100 it's a fully built system that you get and you put in there right and and all of the public cloud providers have been optimizing for cpu world and this gpu phenomenon uh which will continue uh and especially if gpu finds other uses outside of ai which it looks very likely like you know video rendering and things like that that's much more performant and efficient there's all these other sort of uh necessary components to make those that run really well that like a lot of the public cloud providers are not optimized for in terms of how they like uh data centers in terms of like how they actually interact with them uh so so we're seeing this fragmentation mostly because gpus are so crazy expensive right and and the commoditization of cpus and uniformity of cpus and like what amazon's been driving which has been driving the price down like it's like fragmented the market right where like gpus are rising in terms of price continually rising pricing uh and they're improving power but also computerizing pricing versus cpu has been going down well they've been you know amazon's been designing itself to be a walmart right it's been designing itself to be a massive sort of manufacturer and the gpu needs are very bespoke and very like specific uh and it could range from like where you're paying you know two dollars per gpu to four dollars per gpu if you make different decisions in networking or also where you put it in hosting uh and so that's why we've built a worldwide network of data centers and also directly with oems we have partnership with like nvidia uh to actually uh map this better because if you get like for example we have a one of our future partners is based in sweden uh sweden's price per kilowatt hour is almost like 100 better than germany right yeah and and if you actually put it in a specific region right you're also looking at more increased uh uh costs uh in terms of like if you're closer stockholm or closer to to the northern side of sweden and uh there are data centers being built out there using everything from geothermal to solar uh to to uh actually provide heat into towns and all that stuff in terms of when you're running maybe a cpu like not really matter that much right but you're talking about like h100s uh and like yeah like the heat there and the level of needed to actually run that and actually has been a linear growth too so as more and more gpus have come out the energy requirements too is actually linearly increased so the performance has gone like exponential right but the power needs and the heat needs have actually been linear and no one's been able to break the curve yet so it's always going to increase and so these like um these like bespoke sort of data centers around the world are being built that are are highly optimized towards gpus and those mega centers in virginia they're really bad for this like they're not optimized to actually run these high intensity high intensity and it requires a lot of modifications uh to actually do it so so this is why like these these little kind of gpus in terms of why you're seeing one the disparity in pricing so much within the market uh all christmas price gouging as well but like this is very so much in the market and why lambda so cheap these other places so expensive uh is like how they say how you actually designing data center really really impacts uh the performance uh for per hour gpu and so our software enables a bunch of different data centers to basically provide their unique uh features as a real estate company uh that is only unique to them that may be in the cpu would matter for like one cent you know per hour but for a gpu it could be like 30 cents right it could be could be completely different yeah that makes sense how so you hear about things like a100s h100 is being sold out for like 12 18 24 months how are some of the bespoke data centers that you're mentioning are they finding some access to gpu still they have someone order that they're getting online or what does that look like versus the big dealers yeah yeah so so essentially what what uh there was a something in all land where chamoth showed like the the arc and the curve evaluation for the mobile device so i would say that like nvidia is like very aware of that and they saw basically how chip companies got screwed right and so their strategy has actually been really different so so they're trying to do footprint so they're basically spreading themselves out as far as possible uh to as many data centers as possible and they are avoiding big cloud so so you're not going to see a lot of movement in the big cloud companies towards using nvidia machines they're going to invest in their own gpu uh like that's gonna be my guess and i think nvidia is very well very well aware of that is that like you know they they of course they have the best on the market but intel already has some cool stuff out that uh that's pretty good right but nvidia is the brand so they're going to hold that for a number of years uh but you already see competition within the chip space like starting to intensify so nvidia knows that and so they're shifting more towards like software packages like full-on racks just trying to do footprints so that's one reason why you're seeing uh more demand or sorry more supply within these like various data centers is that they're trying to spread themselves out as far as possible uh and among as many companies as possible and trying to get their footprint in so that that people are continually investing in nvidia uh as like a company uh you know to update the area 100s or h100 and service them uh versus like trying to go all in on like one cloud provider because they know that one the cloud provider has much more cash than they do and they could also just invest in making their own chip because you know what they've done they've done that right they've already done that to see amazon google microsoft like less lesson microsoft but the other ones like they've actually done that and they're investing in and they basically cut out different types of expenses in their in their value chain process and so nvidia doesn't want that and so they're trying to spread themselves out do deals directly with companies uh try to like become much more because of horizontal across the world uh that gives them greater flexibility in terms of customer and direct relationship with customers uh they do not want to actually have they're trying their hardest to like not have a middleman between them and their end customer or whatever the company is uh yeah and in fact you know nvidia is uh kind of blind to that like and this is what happened in terms of their their big mistake on the sort of a100 order that they uh during the lockdowns that they had to like wipe off their books is that like they uh what was happening was that they basically like allocate for a market right like certain number of gpu cards and what happened was that the american market was sold out and so companies were basically trying to get the gpu were like going to different regions like africa southeast asia europe placed in the same order to see when what got first and when it got when they got it in they would cancel the other ones right so that's how they got to the situation that they're in uh and and so now navigate is not giving any promises on uh order times uh so like as in sense of like you have to place it and they'll tell you right um and they're trying to develop more jerk relationships with actual companies uh so that they don't get sort of in the same situation that before uh but they're also like they're the kings right now so they can kind of do that right like we've heard of like let's say you know anyone at h100 um uh 80 gig going for let's say 300 300k per right that whenever they get that that like the video now is like charging whatever it receives that they would actually increase the price right right so so they're the kings now right uh so you know props to them they're trying to make as much money as possible because they know they're gonna need a war chass to sort of defend their moat uh but you know so far like nvidia still is the best on the market uh there are other if you go down the food chain to like a4 a40s or or eight you know a10s you can find some more like one-on-one uh level competitors uh but in terms of like the highest performing highest performing uh nvidia by far is still the best you're gonna pay for it and you're gonna wait for it um but yeah like that there there are other i also think there's like this kind of movement which is kind of a little bit silly that like a bunch of companies were saying that they want you know a or h100s and when they could do just fine with like an a10 so or they say yeah yeah or they say they want like ib you don't really need ib because you're not doing any form of like ai like really anything you're just using the cards uh and so that's also causing a lot of problems for nvidia is that like they so push the stuff on the high-end side that they're lower in stuff which would be just as good for a lot of places like no one uses right uh and you yeah exactly yeah it seems almost like when you talk about nvidia using this spreading out strategy it's almost the perfect strategy for hydra to take advantage of because if you're a developer and you need access to more capacity than a single data center can provide it they need to come to somebody like you yeah yeah yeah yeah so so like that's why we we take those like sort of airbnb approach of like let's simplify the software simplified api the security because that's actually what you are getting when you use a big cloud provider and let's just remove the middleman let's do wholesaling right so essentially we just provide the software for nearly free to a data center and we can you can get what amazon gets right you can basically get the rates that they do right uh and because of these data centers you know they're not or these oems like these people manufacturing uh uh uh these nvidia boxes right like they all have colos they all have hosting uh you know we have we have partner in london we have a partner in luxembourg you have a partner in uh france right they they all make machines for uh you know for the big you know the big lambdas and the big amazons uh and they have a cola business right so so every one of those steps right that you see in the in the building of a box to run the internet you're adding 10 to 50 margin right so that's why like the way we're gonna be advertising ourselves in the future is like you know by by the way the best do which is at wholesale right and you you know we're not gonna do any cloud features so you got to use the bare metal as you see fit uh and like you know we'll sell os and the image on it like whatever you bid to a thing you want but like all the other cloud stuff that if you don't need that and if you're running ai you don't really want that uh like it just slows down uh what you're trying to do it makes it more expensive uh then just do what the big boys do right which is buy from a data center uh directly set up the machine put whatever you want on it and run it right and you'll you'll definitely be saving money at the end of the day a sense for like how cute is the demand right now for for these chips like i know you mentioned not everybody needs necessarily the highest performance gpus but if you're willing to pay for it can you get access or are people getting shut out of the market right now that want it or need that level of compute yeah uh it is uh what's our word for it like it depends so like you know you're if you're if you use uh we know lamb guys really well um they're probably like a year out and like getting like really maybe to the point where they have excess uh and the problem with one is bursting that's one reason why there's like kind of this over like uh sold nature is that you can't do what you need to do to like actually build out your value prop um but then but the second is like i actually think that the the distributed nature of of ai and machine learning and sort of the value prop it creates for companies uh is going to continue going forward i don't actually believe that uh ai is a product i think it's a feature of something else and so in that world you actually don't generally pay another provider to like run your ai rather you run your ai in your own co-o in your own facility right because it's something you add to the key part of your product uh that can continually generate value over the time so you generally will not actually like send that to somebody else right to actually run it as a as a separate product so so i i think actually that's where and the proof of this right is that like why would somebody like a big company that has built this like awesome let's say ai for being a bank teller why would you want to share that information if you're charles schwab and you visit to bank of america right you would not right you you would want to own that ip own those interaction points and continue to refine that over the course of time that's actually the only way the ai actually makes sense right is like is this constant refinement process and the likelihood that it exists as a standalone product i think is like very unlikely but very very likely that it was going to be incorporated into lots of things across lots of different products and also in that environment uh distributed gpus across multiple days and it makes a lot of sense because every way is going to be setting up their own clusters to do their own things that they can share across a large company that they can continue to apply these the feature of ai across different parts of their business to finding the thing that makes sense the most uh i think ai is a standalone product and platform i think it's like going to be a very if it does succeed it's going to be like one or two things right versus like you know how many businesses actually specialize in crms right it's like it's like a ton of them right right because it's an individual products that will buy but from an ai perspective i just i just don't i just don't really see that i see it becoming much more open source much more like build your own uh methodology and it becomes much more of a service orientation industry um so you know yay to bain mckinsey and busting consulting right so like like they know they're going to be like i think really big winners here because people are going to need tinkering and like yeah constantly yeah yeah constantly working through through like how to make the ri better i do not believe it's going to be something that like hey here's a widget but the widget here and it works right it's going to be much more of like over the course of time and you want to own that data you want to own that training because that's actually the value of the of the product or you could say the feature uh and outsource the internet company i think it's going to be not very likely uh so that's one reason why we built what we build is that like as companies continue to build out their own instances and try to figure out how they're actually going to incorporate llms uh they're going to want more and more compute right and just gonna they want to be able to pass it off to somebody else because that is something very different so like that if you know let's say you know bank of america i'm sure they have gpus but like bank of america like they're they they have colos they have their own infrastructure right gpus is a completely different animal when it comes to a lot of these things and so i think that's going to be more of like they're going to look for specialties to like say hey i need a40 to do this or r or rtx to do this or an h100 mainly because the price disparity is so huge right uh and and until we see a more commonality and you see sort of like i think that the chip makers start falling off in terms of like you know charges massive merchants i think you're going to see a wide eclectic need of like okay we're gonna use h100 only for this we're gonna do this for this and this for this like you saw very early on in early web days uh you're gonna see a wide eclectic nature needed to actually do what they want to do from a cost saving and performance perspective and then as you know five or ten years you're going to see much more of an equilibrium i think on a commonality across all of the chipmakers uh to where they can like where that's not going to be as needed right yeah i mean optimization is the future of of where people will invest resources it seems like also as you've described that um you know ai being not necessarily a product or feature that almost is a catalyst in your mind to push us to this post-cloud era where everybody is going to cloud and now it's it's colo owning your own bare metal is that is that right like you think that is the right catalyst yeah i i think it's a callous because of that a lot of companies always wanted to do that if you talk to like uh that's one of the thing about like uh cloud that anyone tells you about the nature of like the cloud business is that it's always the state of being constantly unhappy right if you if you talk to you know shell or walmart or whatever right like like it's always this kind of like back and forth game right back and forth back and forth right uh where the ease of use is nice but then it becomes a limitation to an enterprise software product that they have installed and some colo and then there's like some security concern and there's cost and it kind of goes back right there's actually a data center i think it's the one that tesla bought the data center in houston uh or maybe it was chat gbt i forgot i forgot who bought it is it a tesla or lgbt like that data center has like flip-flop back and forth between like shell like three or four times when shell was like we're gonna do cloud no back to college by cloud dr colo right so so and if there's all these like there's these uh middle middle layer people called um value-based resellers right and so they help uh set up all these big cloud deals for like you know gas companies or whatever uh and they will tell you all the time that like that their business is basically never ending because they're always these companies are always unsatisfied with cloud so what i believe is just like cloud's good for certain things and color is good for other things right so what we what we're just fostering is that for those workloads that you think that are more optimized for you running your own bare metal you can just have a cloud like api and billing system and security system like a user permission model that is very similar to amazon and you just use that right and so it makes it easier for them to divide create these hybrid environments uh because it you little generally cannot beat the security i mean that's by far the biggest advantage of bare metal is the the security component compared to cloud uh but this high performance side is is showing much more the weakness of like virtualized cloud uh that like people would just rather invest in the hardware and uh and like resell it and i think that's going to be the case for the next like couple years until like the shortage gets addressed and there's some like less um like i do believe in ai infrastructure i think that's like the next phase of investment that's going to happen in the space uh i'm less bullish on like individual like ai products themselves uh but i do think as like a holistic approach across all of tech that like ai is like ai lms are like a permanent feature of like what's going to be required in a product and so for that sense ai infrastructure i think is going to be the next like huge wave of investment that will actually make a lot of sense right and there's there's some tweet that came out that like every every uh investment in ai company is an investment in nvidia uh and that's technically true like because that's what you need to actually do it so those companies have to do both like i'm not as bullish on but that company that like provides infrastructure in a flexible way that allows companies to you know to build a feature into their product with it i think that that's like the the next the next sort of two years of value the next cycle of value creation i think i just saw i think it was either united or american just announced that they were going to move away from cloud and do a hybrid structure and i'm curious and you mentioned shell as well going back and forth are those you know fortune 100 fortune 500 companies do you think they would be potential customers for hydra or are they always going to want to have maybe more say run their own solution to do code yeah yeah so so this is why we call ourselves call on demand is like because like you know we're this blend of bare metal is a surface and color on demand so we we focus much more on the aspects that like make the imitation surround color uh then bare metal is a service paramount service tends to be more cloudy uh and and it's basically run by the um the internet cells like equinox is the best example of fairmont service so like i mean you can get barrel service from amazon too so uh but what we focus on is more color we cut it guys colo on demand because we're focusing on clusters we're focusing on like more of the networking problems and security problems about building a mesh between different data centers which is much more of like a colo question uh so so yeah like they i think those larger companies would be a customer for us we're focusing on high performance compute right now because the margins are better uh but on our platform too is commodity cpus if you want to buy it right um but the the the idea that we're trying to present is that all this sort of like headache and pain of like uh if you're trying to manage a colo that like if you either like need a new region and you don't want to sort of cost optimize right now uh you just need something set up in like a day less than a day then like we're the best solution for you uh that we can get it going and then you have all the security all the networking done and you just like turn it on and it's it's just like cloud right um so for for people who want those types of security and resiliency models like uh they have that requirement built into they we are good we are an excellent use case uh you know you're still like of course if you if you verticalize like yeah i mean you're always going to save money right if you're actually like buying and negotiating with digital realty on your location sure right but if you don't want to deal with that right then they were a great option uh for you uh so versus like waiting you know three or four months to finally figure out if you're gonna work with this color provider and getting the machines in there and they set up the rack you gotta pay something to do that right so that's done and you just get it right so so that's the like the the the the type of customer that would be drawn to us is they have those specific needs of like they want the security the resiliency the performance of bare metal uh they don't want to actually go manage a cage themselves they don't want to like determine the networking access and set up and be responsible for all that so we provide all that for you via an api yeah with speed yeah um one thing that i i've been having fun following you do on socials on twitter and linkedin put your uh your links in the show notes uh is you'll occasionally post inventory for available gps i'm curious what's the response been like do people does that does that drive sales yeah it does yeah yeah people will email us directly uh and uh because that's the thing is like it's it's like you know fundamentally we're building like a marketplace but that's the thing with marketplace people right it's like do you go to kayak to like if you don't have intention to buy something the question is no
DeepTech315: Nvidia / EVs / x.AI,2024-02-23 00:10:36+00:00,15,KHe2NDZDeIk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHe2NDZDeIk,welcome to deep tech 315 i'm jean along with doug and our topic is apple and ai we're going to break it down into three segments but this is a big enough and important enough event that we felt that a full episode of 315 should be dedicated to it and so we're going to kick it off i'm first going to give a quick background to what apple has said and done so far and then next we're going to talk about what we think that they will in terms of foundation model and hardware and last we're going to talk about use cases so as a point of reference if you haven't been paying any attention apple has not been saying much about artificial intelligence and to the point where it's almost been comical over the past year where we hear google and microsoft will track this will mention in their prepared remarks on earnings call artificial intelligence machine learning 15 to 30 times and then you have app who has yet to mention it in any of their prepared remarks and only responds to the topic on questions and so uh there's is this tension i think with some investors wondering what is apple going to do and do they really treat this uh opportunity as do they see it as big as what many other of their other mega cap uh brethren are seeing this and the answer is that it it sounds like they're seeing it a little bit more and let me just uh fill in the blank here is since their september earnings call tim cook did say that they are spending a lot of time there and they are pursuing this uh with co with um uh with a a respect caution wasn't the word but they're they're going at it slowly and then separately he said in another interview he talked about the importance of ai and he called it absolutely critical to apple's future and that quote absolutely critical jumped out to me and was just a reminder like apple's been doing something around ai for probably longer than we think and uh so i'm gonna that's kind of the the background and i'm g to shift to what we think how this can play out next year and i'll start doug i think we're going to hear a lot from apple when it comes and relatively from where we've been in the past 12 months from apple in 2024 on a relative basis it wouldn't take much for it to be a lot yeah and i think that that's probably true i i wouldn't be surprised if we do see them launch something at this point because i mean really they're the only big tech company that hasn't launched a meaningful ai initiative so far and we can we can go through and talk about how they have ai sprinkled across all their products i mean that's been true in tech technology companies google meta i mean tesla they've been using ai deep learning machine learning before that in their products for a long time so to say that they have ai on all their products is kind of meaningless in my view in the context of this profound gamechanging technology that is really i think a new interface layer that they were early with siri you could argue but now it feels they're a little bit later as we think about llms and and language in the current paradigm i feel like the part that they've really missed here is just if i was going to narrow it down you know you talked about that val it's really that generative piece of it and as you said it's built in a lot of their products when apple talks about ai and their products they don't like talking about the bits and bites they like talking about the features goes way back to the ipod they wanted to talk about a thousand songs in your pocket they didn't want to talk about 10 gigabytes and so i think that's part of the culture of apple is centering how they talk about technologies into to the benefit of customers which i love that they do that and i think in this case it is still fall short when it comes to just the importance of generative ai so where my head is at is what are they going to do related to generative ai and you mentioned seri that's a a great segue that they can build upon i suspect that they're going to do something on siri but before we get to siri doug you and i have been debating about what apple's going to do when it comes to a foundation model my belief has been that they hired john john back in 2018 from google who ran their ai and his head of machine learning and at apple and would that when you bring somebody like over there over they're going to be doing a lot in ai and some of that was related to the mother of all ai projects tim cook famously said with autonomy we haven't seen what that's going to yield but i'm sure he was working on some things some of it may be related to the interface with vision pro but i think that they have to be working they've had to be working on some sort of foundation model for more than a year and they have now this uh it's been leaked that there's this ajax project which is i think some of the foundation models and when i see that i get excited and think apple's going to do their own foundation model in the next year or two and that we even though we haven't heard about it they've been working on it and if tim cook says it's critical to their every product and absolutely critical to their future they've got to get there and so um i don't know i'm i'm optimistic i know we've been on a different page on this but i'm optimistic that they're going to get to that found they're going to have one of the the key five foundation models i don't know if i would agree the key five there's there's a few factors that go into that i do think it's true that they've probably been working on something whether we call it an llm a foundation llm sort of model uh for more than a year i'm sure that true i don't think they've been working on it as long as deep mind and google and i don't think they've been working on it as as long as open ai either and so there is certainly a time gap i think that's realistic to expect and when we put what apple is doing and what that report you referenced in context i mean that report was talking about a model that would have 200 billion parameters what does that even mean gpt 3.5 so the prior version of gpt was about 200 billion parameters current uh gbt 4 is rumored to be over a trillion some some reports have said 1.7 trillion and so even if apple comes out with a foundation model with 200 billion parameters it would be certainly very functional just like gpt 3.5 was um but i don't think it would be on the same quality level it wouldn't be on the same uh ability level as a gemini or a gpt um and i think it'd be really hard for apple to catch up to that because we're talking about this very large time gap between when those two companies really started building foundation models and when apple did and on top of that i think there's a big data difference you know apple does have a a very prominent place in a lot of our lives but they also have a very specific security focus and so all the data that we put into our phone is not stuff that they can just go and use in models they can't go train their models on all the data that passes through their i don't know if that's true google i i think that do you think that apple is going to go and violate your trust as a consumer violate my trust not violate my trust when you sign in and and set up your apple device it says you want to share data that will make our apps better share it with app developers and if it anonymizes the data if apple's in there anonymizing data which i don't know if they're doing this or not but my guess is they've they've got this data that it is such a they don't they don't have your text messages they don't have your emails they don't have your search history right like those are all things that are passing through different mechanisms not sure if they don't have the search history i mean i understand that goes through google i mean but but they a lot of happens on the device from it though we spend so much time on these devices i don't know what the exact things that they're capturing not capturing but just the peer amount of time that we spend on these devices my my sense is that they have more data than we realize they may have more data than we are talking about right now they don't in my opinion have more data that's relevant to the use case of building a foundation model than open a or google that's the point i'm trying to make yeah definitely google for sure uh that what's the what's the great like grock has great data unbelievable data through twitter x what's the what's the phenomenal data that open ai has they've just scraped the internet for market well that's how they started yeah scraped the internet better than anybody else and then i think they've spent more in terms of dollars on uh human reinforcement learning uh reinforcement learning i think that's important for a big deal that's and on top of that they've been in market as the leader for a year and a half now and so every time someone interacts with gpt now they're getting signal just like google gets signal when people do searches yep it reminds me of the i don't know is this a tech is a tech doug knows i'm famous for taking quotes and kind of putting a jean spin on them but uh the nine women can't make a baby in a month i think that may be the name of like a some sort of a tech book about building products and uh i agree that just throwing tens of billions of dollars at training a foundation model doesn't mean you're going to have the best foundation model and even if you had phenomenal data let's say i'm right and apple actually does have more data than we realize and they're going to do more with it the the time to train it it's a that's a really big deal and well you're grinding through training this data that can't just happen that's not about throwing more people at it well you're doing that gemini and gpt are are just leapfrogging further ahead of you is that basically what you're saying is you can't just throw resources at this to catch up i don't think you can but i think there's there's a lot of nuance to this discussion that's really important it doesn't mean that apple can't create a foundation model that's useful i'm arguing that i don't think they're going to have one of the top two or three in terms of pure broad functionality i think that that is the race between open ai and google at this point okay it's hard to see anybody else challenging them for they're gonna have um with that though even if apple creates a a 200 billion parameter model and then from there i'm sure that they will increase that parameter count and it's not all about parameter count there's other things that matter in terms of making a model useful one thing apple does have and we've talked a lot about this in the context of google too incredible distribution over a billion device users on ios and when they bake that into these products there's a natural distribution layer as long as the product's good and that people want to engage with it and that it does useful things where they certainly can still be a player in ai but my argument is just simple like i don't think it's reasonable to expect and i think the odds are low they're not zero but they're low that they end up with one of the let's say top two foundation models when we think about ai agree i agree i was thinking top five and i think they're going to have enough there it sounds like we're more or less on the same page i think they're going to have enough there to create a product around personalized aa i think they're in a unique position to do that uh i think they're going to have enough there to create something that gets people excited about apple and what they're doing in gener of ai and when i say excited i mean increasing engagement selling devices helping revenue growth and so that's where i'm at i think that this is going to be not in 2024 but maybe 2026 i think what the the groundwork they're going to be laying in the next one two years apple's going to come out as being one of the key one of the key players let say top five in ai i'd be curious your take on it i think that's probably true in some senses it's almost though by default i mean it's hard to not imagine the biggest companies in the world being the biggest five ai companies in the world so yes i think that probably ends up being true um the only thing i would add though in terms of thinking about ai products software products from apple broadly i actually think google maps versus apple mc maps is an important analogy here and a prior learning apple maps is fine it's not as good as google maps definitely i agree they don't have as much data and so we were running into the same paradigm here where i think it will be reasonable to question like is it worth apple's time to try to build their own foundation model or might it make more sense for them to use gemini to use open ai maybe they go open source they use llama from meta that'd be a really funny partnership given their relationship um but but i think that's an open question do i think that they're going to be a huge player in ai just through that distribution mechanism absolutely and when we put it together my view is that because they haven't said as much and because i agree they're going to be one of the key players in ai and that generally is not part of the like investing conversation i think this is a levelheaded view of that but i think just that incremental excitement that can build and doug you and i we're on the same page we think we are early innings of ai and this is going to be there's going to be a a bull market on ai for the next three to five years but when uh but when we think about that incremental piece to let's say shares of apple i would my take is this is going to be a positive for the stock in the next one two years yeah we're for focusing on apple i mean i think ai is a positive for all of the me the mag seven stocks so so yes for apple i think it can be a catalyst i think it could be something that ultimately they whether it's built into phones and it gets people to upgrade a little bit faster or it's something that becomes a service that people pay another 10 or $20 a month for i think both of those are within the the potential set of outcomes for apple in terms of revenue drivers um but again i go back to okay well like how does how does the biggest business around ai get built here i don't know that apple will be the one who does that i think that feels like it might be and i'm just saying biggest in terms of absolute dollars created from the business that feels like it might be more something for microsoft maybe open ai maybe it's google i'd put apple a tier below them in terms of overall total dollar potential awesome fun cop topic we did not get to all the topics we're gonna have to do a whole another episode on just the applications about how we see these playing out we're going to leave it there on behalf of doug jean deepwater and deep tech 315 bye for now
Frontier & Center: Block,2024-02-26 22:31:26+00:00,7,hT-ucmbjpCw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT-ucmbjpCw,welcome to pressure points i'm jean and our topic today is elon musk is raising a cool $1 billion dollar that is b as in bravo for x. a and before we jump into the pressure point which is the speed at which humanity is approaching artificial general intelligence i want to give some quick background to the topic first is that x. aai's goal is to compete with the other foundation models there are four current other models outside of grock grock is from x. that is gpt which is made by open ai llama from meta gemini from google and claude from anthropic and so there are now five foundation models that are today largely thought of as chatbots and generative ai but they're really the foundation of what we're building towards when it comes to artificial general intelligence a quick thought on valuation we don't know terms of the deal a typical we have a venture piece at i do a venture investing at deep water and a typical billion dollar raise they're rare but typically the company's going to ra sell about 10% i was talking with doug at deep water about this typically sell about 10% of the company so figure a normal deal would be about a10 billion valuation on this pretty safe to say because zeon's involved you throw normal metrics out the window and probably gets valuation closer to anthropics last round which is rumored to have been about 30 billion back in october so raise a billion on a $3 billion valuation he's going to find a way to get that done and they are off to uh the races i was just doing some quick quick side math here which if they raise a billion dollars maybe 100 million of that goes to nvidia that takes their growth right next year from 57 to 58% but uh all these forces are pushing forward which gets us to the pressure point which is the speed at which humanity is approaching artificial general intelligence that's when a machine thinks like a human and generally how i've thought of it is there are these four foundation models that are moving towards that that goal of agi and the shakeup at open ai was in some ways related to the pace of pursuing opening ey pursuing that goal elon on the other hand has been critical of some of the other foundation model especially open ai at how fast they are pursuing artificial general intelligence and my sense is that even though he's been critical of this he wants to get there faster than anybody else he said at the recent uh uh new york times deal book uh uh event that he thinks that we're around three years away from that other people in video have talked about us being 10 years who knows but it's years away from when we hit artificial general intelligence and just given elon's personality even though he has said some i guess some words of being having some restriction in terms of how fast we pursue the goal of artificial and general intelligence i think he wants to get there uh everything in his that he's done has been to pursue transformation i think about how aggressive he's been with fsd and trying to get that into the wild and uh there's some uh consequences of doing that in the near term for kind of the greater good now autonomous cars and artificial general intelligence are on a pretty different levels in terms of the impact of humanity so maybe there will be some governing that he's doing here but the bottom line is my pressure point thought here is that i think he's all in on artificial general intelligence and i think he wants to get there first and uh if we thought previous to to him raising all this money that there were four foundation models now we have five so think of this as kind of a 25% increase going from four to five a 25% increase in the amount of energy and investment that is going to achieve this goal of agi and i think that hard to predict when it's going to happen but i do think the key takeaway here is that this uh this concept of agi is going to come faster because x. a is going to be raising a boatload of money and elon is uh going to be able to continue to fund and raise money for this company and so notch this in the camp of yet another wow moment with ai that it's just going a lot faster than anything i've ever seen and we'll keep you up to date on any details on behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now
DeepTech315: Apple Car / Figure / Google & Xai,2024-03-01 16:51:33+00:00,15,lUXckw-4_4k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUXckw-4_4k,"welcome to deep tech 315 i'm jean along with doug our three topics today are the release of cybertruck second elon musk comments related to open ai and the broader threat of ai and lastly we'll talk about uh elon musk's comments relative to disney and them going an f to go f themselves so we'll bring it back to the top the first topic is cyber truck something i've been waiting for for a long time i placed my order back in november of 2019 as soon as that ball broke the glass i thought i think i'm gonna give this thing a shot here and i just spoiler alert doug we haven't had a chance to talk about this but i'm gonna ask for that refund on that order the price was just outside of what i was comfortable with i thought i was going to come in 80,000 for the tricked out version they call it cyberbeast it's 100k and the more affordable version which i was hoping would be out next year but being the 50 $60,000 version at 60 initially isn't going to be out until uh 2025 and a three-wheel drive that just doesn't work in in minnesota and i've got a nice uh ram truck that that's working great for me pardon gas powered truck yeah it is gas powered the quick aside is that as i was watching the video and seeing the different features within i mean the price didn't come out to the end but i didn't tell you about this dou but i backed my truck up and hit the very edge of a construction sign was parallel parking the sign came over a crash and i got about a $1,500 dent in the side of my pickup if i'd have cyber truck that probably wouldn't have even been a scratch so put that in the category of a cool feature but it's just out priced the market it's expensive and i think the other thing that is uh worth thinking about in the context of the launch is talk about cybertruck you know first heard about it several years ago and now we've got these 2 million plus reservations i think it's a million plus that's the funny thing was a million i thought i thought it crept over says it's two million but tesla says it's 1 million plus i' take tesla's number yeah the bottom line though is you think about what's happened with interest rates from when cyber truck was announced to now when it's finally coming out the world is in a completely different place we had zero rates essentially for much of the time as we were thinking about cyber truck launch i think people putting deposits down and you talk about price 100k with a 0% rate environment when you're talking about auto loans that maybe are low single digits analized is very different than a world now where we're talking about high single digits or even even above that in terms of rates so that's going to have an impact in terms of how many get delivered that's not an indictment on the truck i think the truck is cool it's definitely unique um but you know i do think the rate environment might tamper a little bit of those pre-orders ultimately coming through my my big picture sense here is two takeaways number one is that this is going to be a sideshow for the next couple years the i think they'll do 35,000 or less vehicles next year maybe 7525 and 2025 it starts to really ramp in 26 and so think of this as like a model s orx for the next few years but eventually the price has to come down tesla wants this to be a mainstream vehicle they got to get that price closer to the f-150 typical f-150 albeit not as good of a car runs about 10k less so they need to really hit that 50 60k price point there's another uh another kind of vector to this whole conversation about cybertruck and all that's anticipated and that's basically that they're ultimately they're doing a lot when it comes to uh innovation around the truck granted it's really expensive but this this battery share feature where you don't have to buy a battery pack and um i'm considering buying a battery pack but now i'm just thinking well if i just get the truck then i can save my 12 grand on a battery pack like those those like innovative features they got a 240 uh plug in the back of this thing i mean like you dry clothes out of this i it's pretty pretty wicked what they're doing and that just stands uh in contrast to me to what traditional auto is doing which i feel like they're just kind of like iphone upgrade cycle it's just kind of kind of marching marking time where i give tesla credit for at least getting out there and being innovative i think they've always they've always carried that flag and that's something i think they'll continue to carry i don't know that traditional auto will ever be the most innovative i would also say though i don't know how useful or how many people are going to buy a cybertruck just because they could plug a dryer into it i don't think that's a killer feature think it is it is cool it is cool but i don't think that people are gonna make that the trade-off between if they want a lightning or a cybertruck i think it's going to come down a little bit to something more simple which is do you love the design and the aesthetic of the cybertruck which is very unique or do you like a traditional pickup where i believe actually the bed on the lightning is a little bit bigger and more utilitarian than the cybertruck and so i think you're going to have you're going to have use case differences you're going to have um aesthetic differences those are going to be much more important than some of these other features that while cool i don't think are going to be the deciding factor if people are really making choices between a cybertruck and a lightning or you know rivan so that that that pet that this the height of the side of the bed's a huge deal with my truck i on a weekly basis i'm putting hand and stuff over when i'm getting in the truck throwing it in the back there and i think that is something that's probably like this biggest x factor that i think may hinder it from being mainstream they got to fix that that piece of it so uh let's shift to our second topic which is uh the dealbook summit a new york times dealbook summit and elon musk's interview there's a lot there uh the first piece that is made the deep tech 315 was related to some of his comments related to open ai and they were kind of along this line that're he's they're taking copyright information he said that they're just lying when they're not saying that they're taking copyright information my sense is they probably are that elon's right that open ai probably is training on that and i don't know does it matter at this point i don't think it matters i think it's one of those genie out of the bag sort of things almost like if you think back to google and search and i think there was a lot of debate at one point about news and you know can google distribute news it's it's in one ways it's good for the news publications because they get distribution from the biggest platform on the planet on the other side does it hurt their ability to monetize from an advertising standpoint things like that and i think we've seen news evolve much more toward paid subscriptions and a little bit away from advertising probably as a result of some of google's actions so to bring that back to the ai piece i mean certainly and we we saw this with twitter and then ultimately threads some of the throttling that we've talked about in the past where there are bots that go and they're just ripping information off of social networks they're ripping information off of reddit so certainly these these uh these models are being trained on some information that they probably shouldn't be i just don't know how that will change i mean will we eventually see agreements in place between you know an open ai or an anthropic um or google and some of these other providers to access data maybe that's what it ultimately turns out being and it's just an economic thing but i don't think that's going to slow down the development of these models in any meaningful way my thought too came on that it's really hard to track this it's going to be hard to you know litigate where this copyright goes and ultimately is that this idea of kind of silo data i guess that's different than copyrighted data is that silo data is still going to be silo that's probably still a competitive advantage for certain businesses that can capitalize on on silo data so that's this is really two different things we talk silo data versus copyright data but in the end my my sense is that it was for me it was just kind of the latest jab between elon and open ai and i think that uh you know he's got a bone to pick there and this kind of seems to be it's not a huge deal but seems to be his latest and probably in a few weeks he'll have some other bone to pick with him well and i think i think grock is still the one of the most exciting things in ai that's a total wild card right now like it it really hasn't what's the big wild card about it well because it is taught specifically and intentionally on the trove of twitter data so you think about what is open ai learned on it's learned on the vast expanse of the internet all the good and bad that that comes with grock is really i think going to be trained in a much more realtime way it's going to have a more probably realtime feel like the actual conversations that are happening on twitter which is the most real-time social network of all the social networks that's the kind of data that's going to be going into to power grock and so i think that's fundamentally in some ways in some use cases more interesting than what open ai will ultimately do what gemini will ultimately be powered on um so by the way it's going to be a this is going to be a foundational model just like the other four foundational models exactly and i think if you think about the foundational models i mean open ai right they've they've created advantage through uh reinforcement learning i think they've spent more and they've done more uh you know reinforcement learning through human feedback than any other company in the world i think that is really what's created their biggest advantage open ai google's got you know two decades worth of data of consumers literally saying i want to see this show me this and then clicking on things to show them when google's right and so that's going to be a huge advantage for them likewise i think grock with that twitter data that is something that's wholly unique versus some of these other foundational models and so as that starts to roll out more and become more widespread i know there's been some people maybe who are skeptics that are teasing because it's got this sort of maybe elon persona it's got a little edge to it but forget the edge let's just see what the what the service actually does and if it does something unique and interesting that could be another kind of layer another step forward in this ai race lightning round do you think elon's view of you let you go first here do you think elon's view of wanting to be more metered and measured around the roll out of ai more broadly is going to change how aggressively he's going to roll out brock and what brock can do i doubt it yeah i doubt it i think you know he has been to to be fair to him he has consistently sort of talked about his concerns about what could happen with ai i mean that's why he was one of the big founders one of the original funders of open ai you know almost a decade ago and so i think it is a genuine concern for him but i'll go back to the whole genie out of the bottle idea right like all these other companies are doing it and at some point my guess is he's a very logical person he's gonna say well yeah i could sit back and wait and be quote unquote responsible or i can take the technology we've built and put it out into the world and kind of see how the world uses it and it feels more like that's probably what's going to happen despite what he says about you know being safe and and the imperatives of safety around ai i'm in your camp i i don't know when safety ever has stopped him from doing anything look at fsd i mean that that is not safe uh to be out in beta and yet he sees the benefit of pushing it to get to what it ultimately should be which is cars should drive themselves and so i think his history is that he wants to really promote this technology i think he's going to be all over it which gets to uh one of the uh bigger topics of the week here elon and telling advertisers to go f themselves i was uh initially shocked and then thoroughly entertained by it i i uh admit that i watched the video many times and just enjoyed uh the concept of some standing up to big advertisers that know that just appealed to me and um my my thought is just like what you know beyond just the pageantry of the whole thing does it does it mean anything for his brand it's a good move for his brand i think net net it probably is i mean he over the last couple years really it seems like he's embraced being a polarizing figure you know love me or hate me but you know don't don't not care about me is has sort of been his mentality i mean in some ways you think about what works on twitter conflict is what works on twitter i mean that's what twitter is it's this real- time conflict social network and i think in a way like his persona lends well to that he in in some ways maybe by extension is the perfect owner of twitter because he embodies what the the network stands for and so i think he's just kind of taking it to the extreme and and i would say like i've heard various different debates about you know the advertisers really don't need x which i think is true they can go and just reallocate those dollars elsewhere and probably get similar or maybe even better return on their spend so it's not just about you know them leaving x for any economic or performance reasons i think what elon's taking issue with and fairly is that they're making this political statement around you know being uh moral and saying we don't want to promote hate and these other things and i think he takes uh i think think he takes a strong objection to that you know he went out and he said he said something wrong number one uh and number two uh if these advertisers really do care about avoiding platforms that supposedly spread hate they absolutely shouldn't be advertising on tik tok they absolutely shouldn't be advertising on instagram those are bigger platforms they spread just as much hate if not more and there's been some recent studies that they may actually spread more hate and so i think there's there's just a hypocrisy he saw validly and said hey guys like you know f you mh my head scratcher here will'll end on this was disney's shares were actually up fractionally the day after the market was down i was thinking they're going to get some cancellations of uh streaming service based on this so i can't wait to hear disney's next earnings call to see if they talk just about that i can say we will be talking again before disney's next earnings we'll see you next week on behalf of doug and jean and deep tech 315 bye for now"
DeepTech315: Copilot Designer / Rivian / Perplexity,2024-03-08 16:44:04+00:00,15,pgNkW7ZFKMw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgNkW7ZFKMw,[music] welcome to frontier and center where we talk about the broader investing themes in frontier tech and also highlight uh a company within the deepwater frontier tech etf that ticker is l u and so for starters in terms of the investor appetite for investing frontier tech continues to be positive as measured by lo's performance year to date it's up 14% versus the nasdaq up 10% and that compares that's a shift from last year where most of the performance came from those big mega cap companies in the case of frontier tech there are companies below 200 billion in market cap so these are looking for higher growth companies and separately is about 60% of the companies within the etf within lup are ai related so it gives you some context as a reminder frontier tech by definition does change that today it as a waiting hire related to ai there's also robotics in there electrification and over time as new themes and opportunities present itself uh there's readjustments to capitalize on companies that are kind of hitting those continually changing growth curves within tech so we're going to shift gears and talk about the spotlight company this week which is axon axo n is the ticker and this is a $23 billion market cap company many of you may know this company this this of course is the taser and body cam company and ask why is this in the deep water frontier tech etf and the answer is because they have opportunities around augment reality with some of the cameras that they have and also related to ai with what they're doing with drones and also evidence management and making the paperwork easier for uh law enforcement and so uh that's why it's in the etf but a little bit more about axon and their business as i mentioned this initially was the taser company and then into the body cam company and the stock over the past year is up about 50% and the biggest reason is that uh those two businesses continue to do better within their core law enforcement markets and that has been a surprise and i think if you look at 2023 their business grew right around 30% and the initial expectations were they were going to grow 20% but essentially the size of the addressable market uh was bigger than what they had thought a year ago uh they continue to believe that that's going to be a good market but as far as how the company is going to evolve going forward uh they see opportunities to continue to service the that law enforcement market as i mentioned kind of that ai piece and also some of the work around different cameras and what filters what they can uh do with that and specifically when it comes to ai it's this ideaa of digital evidence management dem they refer to it as and what the way they can employ it is uh at the most basic level it can help law enforcement fill out paperwork and make it easier to kind of recapture what just happened you have a uh somebody being pulled over on the side of the road and the camera can feed through and basically build a script to what can happen for what happened for filing of paperwork that's something that that is an obvious opportunity but as they advance there as ai advances they can potentially use that in actually some of the evidence within uh the the courtroom uh there is a slow pace that they're going after that piece because uh this is really important stuff and they want to make sure that you're not going to be getting deep fakes within some of uh the evidence that's going to be introduced into courtrooms that's going to be uh generative driven from from ai and so but that is one of the growth opportunities within their core law enforcement they also have a growth opportunities outside of that within the federal uh law enforcement in the us that's still a relatively small market for them the international piece is another area of growth and then uh actually the the third area is related to whole new business line around drones uh autonomous products that they're starting to test and uh it could be some form of robotics that help assist law enforcement or drones and uh when you put those all those pieces together uh what is at the backbone of of this is a a business that has been changing from selling those devices like the taser the the body cam and some of these other opportunities we've just mentioned to creating a software platform that has reoccurring revenue and that is growing really nice ly in 2023 that they grew that business by 57% and so it was 700 million in their software uh business in 2023 so the growth rate of the software business was much faster than the growth rate of the overall business which i just mentioned was about 30% and when this kind of all rolls up together is this year the company will do just over two billion in revenue and grow about 20% from from last year and so to get some context here is that the software piece is call it a third of the business and is uh continues to grow i envision within a couple years that will be more than half the business and that helps the multiple too uh given higher revenue uh visibility but in a nutshell this company leads in uh law enforcement tools and that market is expanding and they are using more technology to infuse into those products to make this them stickier and to create new opportunities to sell new products and so u that's axon i'm jean and this is the uh frontier and center bye for now
Frontier & Center: CrowdStrike,2024-03-08 19:08:13+00:00,8,qX-voR013D0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX-voR013D0,welcome to deep tech 315 i'm jean along with doug and our topic is open ai a recap what's going on will open ai remain as a company and what the impact is for broader big tech and so doug i was thinking how do we do in a minute kind of the recap there's been a lot of stuff that's been going on here the last few days maybe 15 seconds open ai's board fired sam alman in a shocking move friday the entire week has been consumed in tech with uh rumors about why he got fired what he's going to do next then this morning microsoft hired sam alman and greg brockman two people that left open ai and uh here we are now with over 700 of the 770 employees at open ai saying that they'll leave unless sam comes back and it might be just worth u mention the reason why he left again everything isn't totally clear but it sounds like there is some question about the board who's thinking more of this is kind of a research project and sam alman who's thinking about more this is a more of a business opportunity and what the potential you know how to how much to push and stretch ai so that maybe some of the context to why all this thing came out of nowhere just be clear too you said left he was fired just so just so everyone's clear he did not leave open ai he was fired by the board correct i should have been more clear there and the catalyst of that was sounds like just around d essentially the direction of the company and so here we are like you said uh this gets us to up to dat and we'll start with the topic two which is will open ai remain as a company i mean 700 plus people have signed this supposed petition i don't know where this petition is at but all the major uh news services are reporting on it that's about 90 plus percent of the openai employees basically are saying we're going to go wherever sam goes and i wonder like is open ey even entity right now it's not uh liquid right now i could tell you that much i mean there was rumors that there was you know 8090 billion dollars uh in terms of valuation in the secondary markets just at the end of last week and i'd say that's zero now like no one wants to buy stock in this company given what's going on the the value is zero today um and so will it go on interrup there that's probably the most remarkable uh reduction in valuation understand that that could change in a heartbeat too but i've never seen have you seen anything like that i can't think of a even something that's even clos i can't either yeah it's so insane uh and i mean i think to answer the question will it go on it feels like there's a few different scenarios that could play out maybe this board which seems like they've kind of dug in a little bit in terms of bringing sam back they don't want to relinquish their position because as part of sam's negotiations to come back to open ai he wants the board to resign uh for good reason and uh you know unless they do that it seems hard to figure out what the path is here for open ai to continue to exist if 700 employees don't want to work there anymore without saying it's hard to say what the future of the company would be in that case maybe microsoft acquires it uh in some way i'm not sure structurally how that could work or or how uh that would process because obviously you have a nonprofit component to open ai right now the board obviously would be the one that would have to deliberate on any potential acquisition offers from another company so i'm not sure what that would look like um and then scenario three is you know maybe uh sam and greg bring bring the whole band together at microsoft and they just sort of start it over um it feels like those are the options and i don't even it's so crazy like things are happening so fast it's hard to even put any real like meaningful odds on any of those scenarios right well we won't put odds on it but just kind of go down the path of how does the board save open eye as it is today i am going to go under the assumption that these signatures are real and that effectively 's going to leave the company if they don't do anything if they don't bring him back so isn't it kind of isn't open ai essentially done at this point unless he comes back it feels like it yeah i think if sam doesn't come back yeah it it kind of feels like open ai is probably done which is insane to say um given they just had this incredible incredible dev day two weeks ago um you know and now they're microsoft dev day was just yeah just is there like what would they have like the substance of let's say all the people leave is there like ip or is the is like chat gbt the brand worth a billion dollars or is there something left there that somebody's gonna kind of swing in and scoop up i mean it's still pennies on the dollar either way you cut it it would be i mean obviously they have the models it's unclear to me what exactly the commercial relationships and and sort of the investment um from microsoft does in terms of giving microsoft access to those models as i sort of understood it through a reading once they get to agi so when they actually achieve agi sounds like microsoft kinda general intelligence that is right yeah general intelligence it seems like microsoft's claims to ip from open ai uh cease at that point and so you could debate when when do you get to agi um but it it's it's pretty merk in terms of you know what microsoft has what open ai has that's maybe truly unique at this point um but they do have the model we know that for sure right i mean they have gp4 and they have whatever work they've done so far on gp5 this is a little bit of a exercises and guesses on top of guesses here but if we take the approach of kind of the impact on open a they're effectively not going to be around unless altman comes back and and let's go with the case that we'll do the impact we'll move to the third piece of the pressure point of uh deep tech here and talk about what happens to broader tech let's take the case where alman stays at microsoft and then brings over let's say i me basically microsoft's gonna hire all the people that whatever sam says hire i would guess that microsoft's gonna hire all those people if i were them i certainly would i mean i think this is a master stroke by inella to bring sam over to turn a terrible situation i mean this is the most exciting partnership microsoft has it's just evaporated now he's brought over really the catalyst of it and so my view on microsoft is no matter what happens like if sam goes back to open ai and the company resumes that's good for microsoft because they're the keystone partner if they don't right if sam doesn't go back to open ai microsoft has sam and he's going to bring all the people over so in either case i think microsoft is fine here and they still are in the pole position in my view as kind of the ai hardware or sorry the ai infrastructure and software company of the world so pole position option a is that they all stay over at microsoft and uh eventually alman becomes ceo of microsoft fires down the road option b is that they go back and go back uh sorry all this happened in status quo and that's positive for for microsoft in the the case of the if we think about the um the economic impact is there a benefit to microsoft having all this inhouse just to think about the 50-50 partnership i'll guess that there's just more control that microsoft would have i mean ideally for saa this would be to bring sal and company in house right that's probably the best economic outcome for microsoft product development outcome too it probably is yeah i mean economically obviously you have uh control of all the revenue that you're generating you have control of the entire product uh you don't have to deal with uh this as they say on twitter uh dell mindset of being overly cautious perhaps in some people's views it's a very controversial topic but overly cautious on ai development um that's at the behest of microsoft instead of this board that now is at the top of everyone's mind so net net it could be a really great situation for microsoft coming out of this mh and what would they lose i guess i lose track of how much money had they the money that they put in is part actual cash but a lot of it's like azure credits too so what would they be out on that front probably nothing because all that good that was built there gets brought over to microsoft so should you think of this as like a would there be a write down for microsoft on the open ai portion there might be a accounting right down but from economics terms it would be a wash and to a company that's worth over two and a half trillion dollars in market cap and has tens of billions of dollars of net cash in the balance sheet it's irrelevant doesn't matter yep doesn't matter in that front so let's take let's keep going down this path of let's say it ends up at microsoft again everything is could be status quo but it all this talent ends up at microsoft what's the impact for google deep waters investor in google gole companies like apple amazon some of the other hyperscalers what does this ultimately mean my my take is that if everything kind of ends up at microsoft they kind of had this pretty tight grip on at least the what i would consider the business case of around ai i know that there's other manifestations of it but the business case and that grip gets tighter the product innovation probably quickens and the ability to as you talked about kind of opening up kind of the frame that they can use ai for in the products maybe that expands a little bit so kind of advantage microsoft that advantage bumps up a little bit in the case that everybody comes over and therefore disadvantaged to for to google and maybe apple but there's still isn't today just like a great day to be work somebody who employed at open ai there is a narrow window that's open right now that this this event has created for them where there's still a lot of chaos here right like even yeah even if m microsoft does whether they acquire open ai whether they bring the whole team over whe whether sam goes back to open ai whatever the outcome is there's this turmoil that has been created at the entity right some of the employees might be looking for other options but it's also taken a little bit of the shine off of open ai like like we just talked about a week ago we were talking about how awesome and how fast their product development speed was gpts the store coming all these things that are super exciting that they're doing and now we're talking about this weird board govern issue and firing an iconic founder and so i think that google right now has a golden opportunity to step in and really say we are meaningful in ai we can take the poll position back if we work really fast now i don't know culturally again you said we own google we also own microsoft stock um at deep water i don't know if google culturally has that in them i hope they do as an investor but this i think is going to be a really telling period for google the next six weeks between now and the end of the year if they they really go and they're aggressive and you hear some more things coming out of google i think that'd be good for them if you don't then they miss the opportunity and it's it's hard to have a lot of faith in them i think at that point feels like the true winners here are the open ai employees who are going to probably start getting some multiple bids and yes they want to work with sam but if google's out there adding a zero to whatever's going on that would look pretty good i guess yeah well it's it's maybe a grim consolation because whatever they owned in the 90 billion dollar secondary valuation that open ai had a week ago is worth zero right now so they're all they're all probably thinking about that a little bit more than maybe what they'll get going for either way either way they're gna be fine we know that right on if i could do it all over again i would do exactly what i'm doing right now second option to that would be an ai developer so uh this is obviously topic is going to keep evolving doug and i will keep you up to date on that behalf of deep tech 315 bye for now
Pressure Points: FSD,2024-03-08 19:38:46+00:00,8,e2vEGCgFlWs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2vEGCgFlWs,"welcome to deep tech 315 that's doug i'm jean it's a big week in mega cap earnings and we're going to pick the top three meta google and apple and jump right in here doug rewind uh to about three weeks ago to one of our investment meetings and we've owned meta for the past couple years it's worked out i went and proposed that we should be lightening our position going to the quarter because the stock had such a big move and remember you said if we believe in much in ai as we say we do meta's got a great opportunity in front of it let's stay the course glad that we heated that advice and here we are things are actually coming together when it comes to ai for meta they're a pedal to the metal almost reminds me of some of the optimism and intensity that we've heard from microsoft over the p past year when it comes to the paradigm shift i was thinking the exact same thing if you listen to the calls meta and microsoft it was uh telling i mean basically the entire calls for both of them were about ai and uh if you contrast that with google which we'll talk more about in a moment it felt like google had some other things they wanted to talk about uh almost like they didn't really get it like ai is what matters right now we need to be building ai products period it doesn't mean you have to ignore other products but the market cares about ai and i think that that is where the biggest opportunities are for these mega cap companies i want to dive into what the specifics on that opportunity for meta before we do that just do a quick recap on the quarter stocks trading up 20% plus on the news they basically beat by a couple percent if you look at their guidance at the highend of the range which likely they'll hit for the march quarter it would imply a 9% raise uh versus the street the da number that we've gotten to know so well over the last almost 15 years they're going to sunset that this is the last time we're going to see it but it grew 6% year-over-year that is to 2.1 billion people that's compares to 5% growth in september 5% growth in june and way back pre pandemic it was 1 to 2% to 3% kind of a a groin so we've seen a step up and number that i thought was almost impossible to continue to grow their ad pricing was up 2% year-over-year that compares to last year in their march quarter ad pricing was down 22% and they've announced uh launched in the last since their ai i guess day last fall basically three new ai related products and my question is when you look at this engagement number you look at what's happened with the ad numbers it's still really not emp powered that much by ai it's having an impact but we haven't really hit a point where ai is truly impacting the business would you agree with that i would and i've been sort of arguing this for a little while where i think some people are saying where's the ai revenue and there's two problems with that question in my opinion one problem with it is how do you define ai google meta microsoft all these companies apple they've all been using quote unquote ai machine learning techniques learning techniques before we got into this generative ai moment that we're in right now they've all been using ai in their businesses for a decade so they've had impact from ai they continue to have impact from that application of ai and so when you say where's the ai revenue it's it's almost an irrelevant question because it's not specific enough to define what exactly you're asking for if you're asking for where is the generative ai revenue i think we're probably starting to see a little bit of that from meta now where you can test ads right i mean that's one of the big applications we're going to start seeing it more i think in some of the messaging platforms we'll bring it in for business conversations ultimately those will be monetized but i think on the call i mean they basically said don't expect a ton of revenue this year from generative ai and i think that that is a smart message and that was the question i was asking is related to generative ai and i think that's what leads me to uh continue to hold us having deep water hold the stock is that i think think that eventually that generative ai piece like you talked about freeman and some of those experiences those products is going to have a positive impact on their business we're not there yet and you're right as ai does impact one part that it's fun to look back over last couple years idfa and apple that was about a 10% hit to their ad business it took away their ability to help advertisers better understand attribution and like you said that they back in two years ago they started talking about using ai to help uh advert iers better understand better manage campaigns do ab testing on it so yes ai is having an impact but i was uh specific to the generative opportunity and that still kind of lies uh straight ahead the one piece that still is a head scratcher to me is reality labs uh they had a billion in revenue for the first time they lost four billion they said that they're going to increase their spending on year-over year notably increase their spending in it like 15 billion plus a year i suspect that you're spending more than apple is spending on vision pro and u my sense is i just wish they would pull the throttle back here i think it it's going to be a tough road for any headset maker to try to build adoption in the use cases and i just think meta from a tech perspective they're so far behind um what's your take on just kind of how this plays out for reality labs i think when the core business is doing as well as meta core business is you get a pass to do a lot of things and that's what's different about the story now versus a year ago a year ago the core business was uh declining uh there was concerns questions is tik tok going to kill the facebook golden goose obviously that hasn't been the case and so now i think they have so much more latitude not that investors don't care about reality labs but i think that they get a pass for it i'm surprised to hear you say that you think they should give up on it i i would not agree with that because i think think they need to take some moon shots right like if they have the chance to build the next computing platform they should take it um obviously they also need to invest in ai it feels like ai is really the focus of the company at this point i think zuckerberg has said as much several times but i wouldn't say that they should uh give up on what they've built and i still think you know you think about the paradigm between iphone and android a $3,000 headset from apple as great as it will be from an exp experience standpoint is not a mass market device there's room for someone to build a mass market device if this spatial computing thing is real there will be room for a mass market device that probably won't come from apple given history and just to clarify my position is i think they should throttle back i don't think they should give up i think this is a worthwhile investment my take would be don't spend 15 billion year spend half that i think you can stay in the game and as uh the overall theme starts to advance i am a believer in vision pro thrilled to get our hands on it later this afternoon and i think that uh that it's i agree with that thesis around the android of uh the the spatial metaverse world because google uh isn't doing too much when it comes to spatial computing so we'll shift gears and talk a little bit about google so i mentioned what happened with meta shares since google reported their quarter shares are down 7% they've had investors had a few more days to kind of process that you talked about kind of what really jumped out to you was just to start contrast between how aggressive meta going after ai and microsoft and google seems to be a little bit timid around this and i kind of picked up on the the same uh and i just don't get it it feels like this has been their mo since the beginning of the generative ai craze you know a year a little over a year ago now when it started and i i am of the growing opinion uh not even growing it's my opinion period that google needs to have a year of efficiency just like meta did they need to go and they need to cut heads they need to regain culture they need to get a fire lit under them and really go after ai i think as a shareholder i mean we own google we own meta both in our core titan fund we own them both in our public private hybrid fund and uh what's frustrating as a shareholder watching it is google has all the tools they have all the access they've got incredible data to build great ai models and i think gemini is actually a good product i've used it unfettered from bard and i think it's pretty good on bard it sucks um they've got the infrastructure there's the only three companies in the world that really have it amazon and microsoft being the other two and i think they have the talent there but they just haven't they've been so conservative to your point that they're they're afraid of putting you know great products out in the world i think that's been open ai's greatest advantage is they don't have the same resources that google has even with microsoft helping them they don't have the same data they've just been willing to put it out there a little more and google needs to find that somehow and it's a so it comes down to like a risk tolerance for testing products being able for maybe the model yield something that doesn't look good for their brand or but just taking that risk is um yeah and and opening eye just doesn't have anything to lose so they just go for it i think that highlights you know the difference and we we see it right i mean this is the generational thing startups versus incumbents when you're a big one of the five biggest companies in the world you have a lot more to lose and everybody's watching you the scrutiny is higher the government scrutiny we know about everything from uh the doj side and the the uh you know government watching every move that google's making and i think that that has made them scared to move in some ways it reminds me a little bit of microsoft after the internet explorer case you know it felt like they gotten this period where you know they were kind of just stale and i that's my biggest concern as a google shareholder watching that kind of play out i just want to see them do something to shake it up and get some of that fire back because like we said they have what what it takes i think to build great a product ai products but they just haven't been delivering on it to the same degree in the same speed as open ai meta like we talked about before and microsoft thing that blows me away is 2017 we start deep water we have ai is one of our our our foundation themes and we have google telling investors think of us as an ai first company we used to do that buzz word bingo how many times they would talk about ai i bet they talked about ai as much in 2017 as they do today and it it just feels like a a missed opportunity makes sense about that kind of incumbent that innovators a little bit of an innovator dilemma i'm still optimistic uh with you that uh ultra gemini ultra is gonna prove to be something exciting and i think that their search business is going to uh kind of get on the other side of this see the other side of it and i think that part of the pain i think in google shares this week is that search missed fractionally which doesn't help the case that they're going to be able to navigate their search business through this when they have a a slight miss at uh their google cloud was impressive it grew 300 20 base points increase in growth so that was a nice uh re acceleration there but we're staying the course on google and so we're going to shift gears kind of from the advertising world over to the hardware services world with apple for those of you who uh haven't seen the results the quick recap is they beat slightly for the december quarter looking for 1% growth they did 2% growth uh china was down 133% it was down 2 and a half% in the september quarter china continues to weigh on guidance they effectively guided down to 5% a 5% reduction year-over year for the march quarter previously the street was at 1% and when i looked back at the guide downs over the past year is that it it's uh this is as big of a guide down they've had two 3% guide downs this was a 6% % uh that surprised me a lot of it was based on china uh there is a lot of good news uh related to what's going on with the installed base what's going on uh grew at 10% year-over-year it was 11% a year ago so over 2.2 billion active devices i think that's a sign that their ecosystem is great uh also i think good news relative to basically every market outside of china did well japan up 15% europe up 10% but there's this other piece when i just take a step back and when you're when you're ripping through earnings you get into all the metrics and then i i jammed through the metrics and just stepped back and it was like wait a second the last six quarters revenue was down two and a half percent last year was up a couple percent it's going to be down 5 percent so really this hasn't been a growing business and i just started asking myself like what's the true growth rate of apple i've got an answer i'd love your take the true growth rate i i would say what the numbers are telling me is that apple is toward the end of its bread pan it's a phrase we use at deep water in terms of the market opportunity to grow smartphones i mean i think that the iphone now we're 15 years in it's still the best smartphone on the market i don't think there's any debate about that but is there still large untap market opportunity for them to get more people to buy iphones i think it's getting harder i mean you've got full penetration in major markets maybe there's some opportunity in india southeast asia there's still some markets that are maybe open but they're small relative to the rest of the world that's largely penetrated so underlying growth rate i mean you know i think it's probably lower right now than the underlying growth rate for google or meta by comparison meta i don't think they're underlying uh persistent growth growth rate is 20 plus per like we saw you know i think high single digits low double digits is something those companies could do and i would say apple's probably somewhere lower than that yeah we hadn't talked about this going into this uh this podcast but the number i uh gravitated to was 5% iphone grew at 6% in the quarter obviously it's going to take a step down in the march quarter will probably be flattish in march but yeah it feels like that 5% growth with services kind of coming along and uh i think that you know there is debate where see outside of the stock here what multiple do you put on it is a consumer staple i'm just thinking about this purely as a tech company purely as what's the growth question and i think it's probably 5% is the underlying growth and there are some wiggle room around the edges in terms of does something happen with vision pro i think if something does happen we're three to five years away from that being a measurable part of the business could they get in other categories like automotive uh yes potentially and so they're uh i don't want to say apple's going to grow at 5% and that's kind of the end of the story i think they do have optionality out there but i think it's just helpful for me to step back and say let's just look at this and it's the reality is that um half their businesses the smartphone like you said smartphone market is slowing they're gaining share within it but it's still a slowing market and they got to look for other things it starts to make the vision pro even though it's so far out kind of increases the what's at stake here for them to try to crack that coke i got to believe the growth question is on tim ko's mind that and probably what happens in china i think probably those two things and i would imagine generative ai is also a question is m brought it up finally on the call for the first time i mean not the first time but it was the first time in prepared remarks yeah i buried the lead there uh that is that's a is worth mentioning as you said doug uh cook mentioned it for the first time his prepared remarks we have a prediction that they will announce a foundation model at wwdc this should allow them to do generative maybe eventually get into the market of doing personalized ai by the way meta talked about having a ai chat bot to help you do tasks too so seems like that theme is getting some attention so glad you mentioned that that is important ai could be a beneficiary to apple here don't think changes that topline conversation i think it's still kind of in that 5% range um we're going to wrap there on behalf of uh it's been a fun and informative week on behalf of doug jean and deep tech 315 bye for now"
Pressure Points: TikTok Ban & Meta,2024-03-12 14:41:13+00:00,7,KEYkQmEb-WY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYkQmEb-WY,welcome to pressure points our topic is apple getting ready to jump into the generative ai race that of course will come on june 10th at the wwdc keynote and as far as pressure points we know there's going to be a lot of talk of ai at the event i wanted to narrow into what i think is the most significant news or significant development there and then talk about some less significant but still ai related uh developments and so the pressure point is related to what i believe is going to be a monumental change in the os both ios and mac os i think it's going to be the most significant change since the 1980s with the point and click methodology was established that methodology was the same framework that was used for the scroll and tap when ios was announced in 2007 and so i kind of think of those two as the same general paradigms but what i think we will see in june is a new paradigm related to how the os interacts with different apps and programs on the devices and specifically instead of using a scroll or a point type of a methodology it will use a either text or voice input prompting to get actions done and so at the most basic level an example would be in in the old paradigm you would open your phone you'd go to an app you tap in the app you go to the hamburger menu you'd find what you're looking for and then you execute that so for example if you were getting an uber that would be the process of of summoning an uber and the new paradigm you would either through text or voice just ask your phone get me an uber to the airport and the uber app would have some links built into that would connect to the underlying uh operating system that has that generative feature and together they would work to perform the task and so it just essentially takes friction out of the process you can imagine another example would be order me a pizza or kind of endless examples uh so i think that this new paradigm shift is something that we'll hear more about and i would consider it the most significant announcement at wwdc uh this of course would be a big step forward a huge step forward for apple but it would not be as significant relative to what's already happened and at microsoft and google's developer date in 2023 so this is may of 20123 both companies announced variations of their uh in microsoft's case the windows operating system powered by co-pilot which did some of that same functionality that i just described and separately as google even though they don't really talk as much about like an operating system but talked about different like the g suite of products allowing you to uh use prompts to get work done and generate text for emails things like that calendars and so there is this uh piece of wwdc which is some of it is playing catchup to what has already been announced by microsoft and google and keep in mind that microsoft and google will have their 2024 dev days before wwdc and so presumably that bar is going to get even wider so you know what's that gap that apple's going to close that's going to be one kind of uh contour to the debate around how to think about what's going on between these big tech giants but another piece that's i think less relevant what i think is more relevant is just relative to the apple experience uh it will take a meaningful step step forward relative to how the operating system interacts with the user and so that's what i think is the biggest pressure point to simply a better way to interact with your operating systems they will announce it it probably ends up coming out in the fall as far as what powers those changes whether it's their own mm1 model whether that includes licensing some features from gpt or gemini to be determined but the the most think important context is just this step forward in terms of how their os works so that's the pressure point i do want to mention a couple other pieces what i think will come out from the developer conference related to ai and one is uh tools to make it easier for developers to add ai models to their applications and so again how this comes to fruition whether it's linking to an apple foundation model that should be announced this mm1 uh smaller model or working with gpt or gemini that could be the case as well and of course as part of that infusing generative ai into apple sua products whether it's in messaging today it does predictive text it does not do generative ai but actually generative uh messaging emails pages numbers calendars all of that should start to see some impact from generative ai and then the last piece is what's going to happen with siri and of course siri is comically behind when it comes to ai even though they had a big opportunity call it almost 10 years ago to be a pioneer around the topic and i think the case what they could add is just simple functionality to make it more conversational so i don't believe that we're going to see siri powered by ai more conversational in the summer it probably is going to be late 2024 but i kind of put that as uh something that i'm optimistic we'll see so to put it together i think the biggest news is going to be relative to the new operating system i think we're going to see ways for developers to integrate ai into some of their apps and then uh the last piece is related to what can happen to siri i i do want to add another piece is kind of longer term and we're likely not going to hear anything about this but i do think long term apple has a unique opportunity run personalized personalized ai and this would be the ability for apps to do complicated tasks on their own beyond just summoning an uber it would be resolving for example uh maybe an issue you have with your uh your cable company about a bill u there can be uh an opportunity there is an opportunity with apple just given their their brand around private y to create a product around that but that is down the road and so uh that's my expectations for wwdc it will be a big day for apple and on behalf of this episode of pressure points i'm jean bye for now
Gene Munster on Deepwater Asset Management,2024-03-14 16:27:38+00:00,5,2YMGHfIyh-w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YMGHfIyh-w,[music] welcome to this week's episode of frontier and center i'm jean monster this is where we discuss frontier tech more broadly and then highlight one of the companies within the deepwater frontier tech etf as far as the broader theme around frontier tech is that the trend continues to be positive year-to date the lup etf as a benchmark for frontier tech is up 99.8% that compares to the nasdaq being up 6.8 %c and so uh since inception l is up 82% that was back in the summer of 2018 next we're going to shift to focusing on one of the companies within the etf and this week we're going to talk about take two take two interactive if you're under the age of 30 there is a high probability that you have played one of their games of course they're best known for grand theft auto and nba 2k along with red dead redemption they also bought zinga a few years ago but this is a gaming publisher it's a 26 billion market cap company over the past year the stock is up 38% and that compares the nasdaq up about 32% so it's done slightly better so just drilling down deeper into what this company is all about and the reason why it's in the etf is that we believe that from a time spent perspective a value and entertainment perspective gaming will continue to be an important layer and we'll be gaining increased usage of our time and when we think about the key publishers there's only really two left after activision's acquisition from microsoft that leaves ea and take 2 as kind of the sole publishers and the ch2 story over the past few years has been muddled they bought zinga the mobile gaming company at probably the worst time it was at the peak of the everything bubble and sales were quickly drifted lower they overpaid and once the uh the pandemic started to unwind so did the adoption or the use of some of their mobile games and so what we saw is a company that's been challenged on the top line over the last couple years and one of the key questions from investors is when will the mobile business which is half of their overall business start to grow again and the answer is in the next year we'll start to see uh growth again from the highest level this company's business last year is basically flat and it's expected to be up about 35% next year i think it actually can grow even faster than that so this huge uptake and for those of you who know grand theft auto you know what i'm going to say next is there is an upgrade coming grand theft auto 6 this is a big one about as big as it comes in the gaming world the last time it was updated at least the core engine was in 2013 uh that will be about 12 13 years in between upgrades a a just a a a lifetime unprecedented uh span between upgrades there that obviously is going to be positive for demand when that does come out it is worth noting that the game hasn't been stale since for the last 13 years they have been doing these updates in terms of service packs and also adding new content that you can purchase and that's been kind of moving the business along they typically sell about six to $800 million a year and some of that additional content which would be like for example purchase a car in grand theft auto or an apartment maybe an airplane and uh that has kind of moved the business or kept it going but the big picture here is pretty straightforward is that there's only two publishers out there and take two has the biggest game biggest upgrade coming in gaming history next year which really gets down to the pressure point uh within take 2 at least over the next uh year is going to be what is the anticipation going to be how excited our investors going to get in anticipation i think we'll see multiple expansion we typically do going into these cycles and then ultimately when the rubber hits the road those first four quarters of the release how's it going to do and typically over uh the first four quarters of a upgrade we have to go back again to 2013 but they sold about 40 million copies over the first four million uh first four quarters and we expect them to exceed that so at deep water uh this company is in our view position to have upside to numbers next year not only because of the underlying strength of the initial upgrades but also this is going to be a shot in of adrenaline when it comes to their g their content their in-game content and so that should also increase call it going from around 600 million this year to to probably 1.2 billion in that first full year of grand theft auto 6 and so uh two positives here one is mobile returning to growth half the business and the other is finally we get to see grand theft auto 6 if this is the first time you've heard about it i guarantee you'll be hearing about it a lot over the next nine months i'm not a gamer but i'm excited to read the reviews and see uh the the sales on this move in the right direction so on behalf of front this week's episode of frontier and center i'm jean bye for now
DeepTech315: TikTok / Apple EU App Store / xAI,2024-03-14 16:37:39+00:00,15,EMkw1cWGesQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMkw1cWGesQ,welcome to deep tech 315 our topics this week are inflation versus ai which of those two forces will dominate the tech market for the next year second we're going to talk a little bit more about the opportunity and what expectations should be around august 8th in the robo taxi announcement from tesla and last we'll give some of our thoughts related to recent commentary from jamie diamond and elon related to where we're at in the whole cycle of ai so we'll take it to the top here as of this recording we are on the same day where a hot cpi number it was an expected hot but it was even hotter than hot and specifically is that the core inflation number is running at least the last six months they average over the last 6 months at 3.9% high since july of 2023 the trend is not the friend when it comes to inflation we at deep water don't think a lot about inflation because we want to focus on paradigm shifts and competitive advantage within companies but we are have to navigate within that environment and so here we are the nasdaq down call it just about 1% uh on that news and we have companies like amd that are down two and a half percent and then nvidia it's actually up it's been down 10% over last few weeks but it's up a percent plus today and so uh you know as you think about this is the tug of war that i think is going on here is do you believe that the stronger arm is inflation or the power of ai at least over the next 12 months i think that it it might be a wash in this sense i've i've always felt that the mega cap tech companies are a mechanism for offense and defense they're offense because they have these ai plays they've got probably the best optionality aside from a few private companies that we do try to invest in at deep water um you know i think the mega cap techs have that ai optionality and then on the defensive side they've got fortress balance sheets and so even if we get a recession even if we have to get pushed into recession because inflation doesn't go down to the fed's 2% goal i think these companies are are in a good spot does that mean the stock can just keep going up forever probably not i think if the market pulls back broadly those stocks may slow down too but i say it's a wash just because like i believe in the power of ai in a longer time period but when you talk about 6 12 months it might be one where it's just this tug of war and we we kind of end up maybe nowhere the rate expectations are probably sitting right around a couple cuts still after this hotter number a couple cuts this year that's down from i think originally it was five uh eventually we'll probably get to no cuts this year and my sense is that no cuts is going to be kind of the the the headwind not the death of the market but the headwind of the market but these death by a couple cuts here that just over week to week to week people just getting more on board that we're probably not going to see rate cuts this year that probably does create a headwind agree with you on that but i'm more optimistic at least in the next six to 12 months i think that uh what we are going to continue see the pace of that curve the innovation curve is exceeding what our optimistic expectations were a year ago in terms of how we're seeing ai being deployed and i think that we'll see it in the numbers not that it's going to be any big liftoff in numbers whether it's big tech or smaller companies but enough to reinsure investors that this isn't a head fake that ai is not a head fake and i put those two still those two forces i'm g to take ai with a slight upper hand here and say that we're going to continue to be forming a three to five year bull market that's going to be driven by ai i hope you're right number one because that's that's how we are positioning ourselves thinking beyond the short term because i i agree with you 100% if you think about the three-year picture you think about the four-year picture i still believe that we will have a continued ai bull market we're just now still in the heart of the infrastructure buildout phase we've got reports that microsoft is going to spend a hundred billion dollars to build a super supercomputer potentially so we're still building you it's a huge number and so i think that we're still in that build phase to your point about seeing it hit in some of the numbers for these application companies obviously we haven't seen revenue inflections from some of the companies that offer software instead of hardware i think we will get that probably not this year i will caveat that i think it's probably more like next year we maybe start to see some of those numbers really get impacted by ai i think the is still kind of a slow build year from an application standpoint but i mean we're believers in the power of the technology we use it for uh doing projects like intelligent alpha that we talked about before where we're using it to pick stocks and it's very capable at that i think it's going to be capable of a lot of things that humans do in the future too by the way intelligent alpha is such a juicy topic i think we have to do an entire deep tech episode we'll break it down into three pieces but talk about intelligent alpha uh keep that on our our r uh so i i just want to uh make it clear for our listeners two things number one this is not investment advice this is just doug and i thinking and second is uh my view that i think the market still goes higher even though interest rates will remain higher for longer and uh want to get your can you cap kind of encapsulate your view i said that they probably offset each other i think that we probably are sort of range bound let's say for the next sixish months is would be my guess love it uh second topic is a sequel to a topic that we discussed last week which is elon and the robo taxi when we recorded the last episode we felt like this was going to come there was going to be some sort of announcement about an event and in fact it did come after we had recorded the episode and the case of course is august 8th where we're going to see uh whatever they're going to say about robotaxi i do think it's appropriate uh before we talk about that event to go back five years almost to the day to tesla's i think they call it the ai day or autonomy day uh back in in 28 2019 april 2019 that's when they showed off a lot of the bells and whistles they talked about the robo taxi they showed like a a mockup of what it would look like on on an app and then they uh and elon proceeded to talk about having a million robo taxis on the road by the end of 2019 um uh by maybe it was within a year or year ahead either way uh the stock did nothing when that happened because investors it went in one year appropriately and out the other who says markets aren't efficient right yeah that's right since then uh elon continues to reiterate uh that it's we're one year away from full autonomy and since then we've got 12.3.3 which is in my view a measurable update i'm taking a lot from what i've read about it and what i've heard from our own andrew murphy who has used the product uh i i heard today that there was a uber driver who did 45 minutes in san francisco using it just videoed the whole 45 minutes two or three rides and had no interventions so uh this piece it feels like there's definitely more meat than five years ago but going into as we start thinking more about what's probably going to be a tough quarter when they report on the 23rd tesla and the negative about what's going on with evs and then the positive about the autonomy event um i'm i'm pretty bold up understanding that uh there's a long way to go here but this i think has the potential or not i think this does have the potential to i think change the investment view on tesla i think it has the potential i think the timing is still going to be the big question for for me though and that's always my role as the the rational optimist i think if they are able to deliver on the promise of robo taxy the long the long debated promise um it is potentially meaningful i mean you look at uber uber is a more than hundred billion doll company you look at door dash another 50 plus billion dollar company um there's a lot of value in creating things that can transport humans and and goods um so certainly that that exists that potential exists like we've talked about before though i think the question is really how quickly can you bring it to market not just from a product standpoint and a technology standpoint but from a regulatory standpoint that might be the biggest bottleneck and you know i think that that timing probably will matter in terms of when you actually see the impact on numbers and then to the stock um you i just want to uh recap that was a great point about bringing up uber's market cap uh did you say it was 150 is that right i said over 100 i know okay yeah 154 billion it's a real company there's tesla's market cap right now is right around 500 billion so i mean this has a lever obviously uber is global aot is a long way to get there so but you're uh i would agree with your entral point that this is a real market and and maybe from a kind of a fit and finish what to expect my sense is they're going to say they're going to have an just like they talked about in 2019 and you can participate you can have your car participate or maybe this is opened up to third parties who buy them with a license some sort of a business license and you buy 10 20 30 cars or does actually tesla own the cars because if you do the math and we're going to be showcasing more of this math you get to you get to a point where it is um could be pretty powerful to tesla to actually own the cars i think that is um important for a few dynamics because when you have this self-driving robo taxi network that we've talked about one of the unanswered questions is who's ultimately responsible right if if there is an accident and there will be accidents robots won't be won't be perfect just as humans are they'll be better than humans but they still won't be perfect um is that the responsibility of tesla if it were a person's car someone who owned a tesla and was renting their car out through the network would it be their responsibility so to the extent that obviously if tesla is owning and operating the vehicles i think it makes that part of the story clear and i do think that that part of the story does play into this broader regulatory question because i think i think the government is going to want to know ultimately where will responsibility lie they might even want to have a say in terms of where that responsibility lies i think it also lines up having tesla having their own fleet lines up with what they've talked about optimist and about labor and kind of disrupting some of that and those opportunities too and so i'm uh i'm uh keenly awaiting for august 8th and uh final topic here mentioned that elon and jamie diamond had some comments related to a we're just going to focus on one of those comments i'm going to pull it up here to make sure i get it right is that uh elon said this week on a podcast that this is related to i think artificial general intelligence but i'll read you the quote want to get your reaction to it my guess is that we'll have ai that is smarter than anyone human probably around the end of next year can you decode what that means well this is one of my favorite debates about ai because what it means to be smarter than a human is highly subjective right does that a agi or not i don't know is smarter than a human agi i would argue that's probably not agi but i think what agi is is even debatable like we can get very philosophical about it i think what elon is basically saying and this is how i think about it again going back to what we talked about with intelligent alpha i use these products with a lot of depth and i think when you talk about is ai smarter than a human it's it's a difficult question it's even a flawed question to some degree because you're trying to equate it to humanlike intelligence mh versus capability that's the distinction that i think is really important to make is ai learning and thinking about the world like a human right now no i don't know that it ever will do that but in certain contexts in certain use cases even self-driving take that as an example is it as competent as a human i think it probably is self-driving i think we could make a good argument that it's probably better than a human if you look at accident rates for the technology versus human beings sure so i think we're probably close to certainly use cases where ai is smarter than a human and i think from a a broader standpoint and we're seeing it with llms because they are so dynamic they can be used for so many different things and they can learn so many different things um i think that we're probably getting to a place where again from a capability standpoint not does it think like a human from a capab standpoint i think elon might be right exciting uh exciting to think about that exciting to think about what comes after with super intelligence and appreciate everyone joining us for this last this episode we'll see you next week on behalf of doug and jean bye for now
"DeepTech315: Nvidia's ""Woodstock"" / Apple's AI / Reddit IPO",2024-03-21 14:53:59+00:00,16,Tbj6VDgnDpM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj6VDgnDpM,welcome to pressure points i'm jean monster we have a special edition a preview of apple earnings and they report thursday night february 1st there is no single pressure point here there's several topics i will start with uh what i believe is going to be the most compelling data point that i'm looking for is their annual update to the active device base the last time they actually reported a number was back in february of 2023 on their earnings date they don't commit to reporting this metric every every year but i'm hopeful that they will give that metric uh that number a year ago was over two billion active devices that grew 11% from 2021 so we have the 2021 data 22 we're looking to get 23 active base when they report this quarter that's important because i think that is really the substance of what where the investment thesis on apple is evolving it was a device company services and now we're moving to this uh consumer staples approach and as the active install base grows investors can be confident that you can have a good quarter or a bad quarter with the iphone but if you continue to grow that active base eventually those upgrades are going to come and they're going to find different ways to monetize that base with services and so i'm optimistic uh that we're going to see that number but that is first and foremost on my mind but of course that's not what most people are going to be focusing on it will be the overall business and the iphone so as far as the overall revenue for the quarter the street's looking for just under 1% year-over-year growth now recall when they reported their september quarter this is early november they printed that quarter uh luca the cfo gave some guidance that ended up having a negative impact on the stock as soon as he said this the stock traded down 5% in after hours trading but he talked about the business trajectory uh relative to 13 weeks in this december quarter versus 14 weeks in the year ago december quarter and what that meant is that the street numbers were going to come down by 3 45% and so those numbers gravitated to this 1% expectation that we have going into their earnings now luca did say at the time that on a quarter on a week over week basis that the december quarter was tracking up 7% and so when you take a 14 we quarter that's up 7% and then you change that into a 13we quarter that changes the growth rate to like up five to six and a half% somewhere in that range and again the street's looking for up 1% so i actually think that there is room for upside on the overall revenue number the margins the expectations those numbers tend to be pretty high people are continuing to expect margin expansion but i think that the positive here is i do see a path to upside which kind of goes in the face of what has been some more concern it's rare that you see apple have two downgrades before they reported the quarters those are colors came at the beginning of the year in the first few weeks of january and the substance of those downgrades was concern about china so we're going to uh go to the second topic here which is related to the iphone and china and the impact and so just very broad strokes here obviously iphone just over half of the revenue it's more as a percentage of revenue in the december quarter but that concern about what happens related to china was one of the catalst there was the piece about the macro in china and separately this concern that the chinese government is directing some of the government employees not to purchase iphones so we'll start with a macro piece china in in the september quarter was down 2 and a half% for apple and the data that idc has come out with for the iphone specifically in china in the december quarter was that it was down 2% so i think that's probably a good benchmark to think about china being overall down a couple percent uh and again that's 20% of the total sales is going to be related to uh china 20% of iphone sales are loosely going to be related to china so my by my math i think that that china business will be down call it 2% now there's the added piece about what happens with this government uh and the government direction it's not a formal uh ruling or formal direction from chinese leadership it is been talked about and i believe that it's kind of well known that the wink and the nod is that those government employees should not be buying iphones and if you look at the overall iphone base and look at the number of government employees that uh that are in china and then you can overlay percent that get the uh the highest end phones it basically comes out to be about in any given year about 3 to 5% of iphones come from that chinese government worker and so if that went to zero that's going to be uh a 3 to 5% hit to overall iphone and again iphone just over half a revenue so about 2 and a half% to overall revenue of course it's not going to go to zero but it may be a headwind and i think that there's still some some uh lack of clarity in terms of how china ultimately plays out i think it's going to be fine but i think that in part the overall iphone number is going to be fine because i believe that the uh outside of china i think that the growth has been pretty good we've heard from the us carriers that they've seen a good upgrade cycle on iphone 15 we usually usually hear that we're glad to hear that as well one more piece i forgot to mention too there was also some concern in china about discounting and i want to mention that it is typical that apple runs short programs for discounting around chinese new year and it's my understanding that these discounts were similar they were doing discounting but similar to previous uh new year discounting that was done and so kind of putting all of this together the streets looking for iphone growth of 2.8% year-over-year in the december quarter i think that's a good number i think that uh there may even be room for a little bit of upside relative to that number so just kind of moving down looking at the the next line item that being ipad think of this is called it 10% of revenue ipad's going to have a difficult quarter just based on what some of the product releases were a year ago so the street is looking for ipad to be down 21% really get hit pretty hard here i think there's probably more room for upside given the expectations are really low there probably a little bit of room for upside it's still going to be down meaningfully but i don't think it's going to be down 21% as far as the mac business again call 10% of revenue street's looking for the mac to grow a couple percent i don't have a strong view on how mac plays out this quarter and last is wearables and at least on the product side on the wearables front uh this is coming up against a difficult comp because of some of the new watches that came out in fall 2022 specifically the ultra came out of course there's the ultra 2 but it was a pretty uh small upgrade so there's a difficult comp there and the street's looking for the wearable segment to be down 16% i could see it being down a little bit more than uh 16% uh so we'll see how that dynamic plays out uh which gets us to services and the streets looking for about 12 12% growth in services i think we can see a little bit of upside in services that that has been continuous show uh surprising strength i think we can see a little bit of upside in services but the biggest i think that's going to be an important topic on the earnings call related to how to think and model about services and so specifically we have these new rules that are going to affect in march so they've developers now have the ability to work with a new tool kit this is related to how the app store plays out if we think about services overall just over 20% of revenue i believe the app store is about 35% of the services revenue so um you get some scope it's not all services but a big piece of services does come down to the app store and of course there are these changes that are happening and they're pretty significant and apple has uh talked about them lowering their the take rate that they're going to be uh charging developers that want to distribute their apps through thirdparty app stores so you'll be allowed in europe starting in march to to download a third-party app store and if you transact within that app store apple's going to take a lower fee they will allow developers to continue to use the app store as is but they're going to give the option to distribute some of those apps through the store now it's a complicated topic i should just do a whole podcast just on how the take rate is going to play out in europe but the bottom line is this is that for the biggest developers you could see the take rates going from 30 to 20% and from some of the smaller going from 15 to 10% and there's this other caveat that whatever decision that the developers make if they decide to go off platform they're really not allowed back on platform it gets for technical reasons it gets confusing and so i think the net of this is there is going to be a headwin relative to the app store business in europe if we think about that as a total percentage of the app store call that a third of the overall app store revenue so this is something that could impact how analysts start to model the services growth uh going into 2025 basically so as i mentioned the street's looking for 12 and a half% growth in december for the march quarter similar growth rates 12 a half% and for full year 24 and 25 similar growth rates 12% so i could actually see a little bit of downside to that and then of course there's the question about the whole steering and how apple is are they going to be allowed to charge the 27% for app developers that steer in the us and there's an open-ended question there so uh there is more questions than typical going into apple earnings starting with what's going on in china demand with the iphone separate we talked about the app store there is of course the blood oxygen sensor eventually they'll find a a workaround related to to that i don't foresee that having material impact on the 2024 results but it is something that is in the category of a a headwind and in wearables in 2024 so you put all this together and come back to investors are looking at the december quarter to better understand what it means for the context of the business in the full year 24 and 25 and for the full year 24 the street's looking for 5% revenue growth so is looking for a little bit of a step up in revenue growth i feel that that's ultimately going to be the right number i don't see big upside to that number the reason why i don't see big upside is we've got some of those variables related to what's going on with the app store and separately a little bit on the uh the wearables front and then for 2026 the street's looking for similar growth like 5 and a half excuse me for 2025 similar growth like 5 and a half per. so putting all of this together i think that this is going to be a solid quarter for apple i think that their outlook is going to to be optimistic i think that they will uh have talk about some of these headwinds but say that they don't really expect some of these headwinds with the app store for example to have a material impact on the business at least in the march quarter and so there is one other topic one more thing which is of course artificial intelligence and we know that apple has not said anything about ai and their prepared remarks in 2023 the only uh mega cap company that has and mum on the topic they do address artificial intelligence when it comes up in the q&a but is i think this is an opportunity where we're going to hear more on the prepared remarks from apple and the reason is that i think they're getting closer to coming out with a foundation model their first foundation model and expect that to be announced at wwdc in june and i've kind of had this working title of the model it's code named ajax they call it ser sir maybe siri's brand isn't where they want it to be because it's kind of stuck in this single question that more conversational and generative so maybe they come out with a different name that's neither here nor there what's important is apple has an opportunity to build a foundation model and i think that they will get there i think they'll get there this year i think it's important because when we think about that point where we started from about the active install base when you think about these customers that have multiple devices and apple being unique and kind of bringing them all together the desire to have ai embedded not only just in how the products work but how we interact with them is going to be increasingly important to that base and apple has an opportunity they've got great talent around ai an opportunity to do that their number of white papers that they've written around ai has increased recently so i think that that is a clear opportunity uh for them to say more i do uh believe that apple's gon to have a great foundation model i don't believe it will be the best foundation model because of how they're getting data and training data i think that they're going to really limit uh a lot of the data that they have they don't want to use that because they don't want to compromise their brand around security and and privacy and so but i do expect the model to be good enough where they can be a key player where we love their consumers love their their their ai uh enabled their personalized ai that i think that they can build into a lot of their products so uh of course there's going to be some questions lastly about vision pro not expecting much this year along with most analysts uh they're not going to give a number it's going to be in the weable segment they probably did 500 million in the march quarter in terms of vision pro revenue so it's still relatively small and i think what's most important is the number of apps that are available at release it's got to be more than 50 i'm i think if it's below 50 that's going to be a disappointment if it's above 50 i think that's going to be a positive there's rumors that it's going to be around 200 that's kind of uh where people's uh consensus is there but this is the year for tech enthusiasts and developers to try vision pro build those applications that get us more excited about using the product longer term i am optimistic that eventually vision pro will be 15% of revenue so a lot there i'll be reporting back after earnings at at what the pressure point was relative to the quarter but going into this i think that apple and its the investment thesis will remain intact on behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now
Frontier & Center: Axon,2024-03-21 19:00:28+00:00,7,A5uK_s-wdos,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5uK_s-wdos,"welcome to pressure points i'm jean monster our topic today is the cyber truck this is going to be launching on november 30th we're going to talk about the history of the cyber truck the size of the market the expectations in terms of units and production and lastly the big picture and we'll start with the history the cyber truck was announced in november of 2019 that of course was the famous breaking of the glass event at the time the company talked about that being a $40,000 a year vehicle and it's rumored to be 60,000 plus today and they expected it to be available sometime in 2021 i'll give tesla a pass on this despite all of elon's over promising and under delivering on time frames we obviously had some headwinds in 2020 and 2021 but here we are late in 23 and we're ready to get this party started so that's the overall history when shifting to the size of the market the light truck market in the us is sizable it's about 20% of total vehicles sold there's somewhere between 13 and 15 million vehicles sold every year in the us and about 3 million of those are light trucks pickup trucks if you're curious passenger cars account for about 25% and about 65% or 55% are from some form of an suv so this is a worthy market that they're going after the leader of course is the ford f-150 and they do about 600,000 vehicles a year so that's the overall market and now the impact to the numbers and expectations on production we'll start with 2023 the most of analysts in wall street just generally sees this as kind of a throwaway there are numbers as low as a few hundred and as high as 10,000 we're at 1 ,000 for this year again generally a throwaway 2024 we're at 35,000 the range from the street is 25,000 to 100,000 so all over the place in 2025 we're at 175,000 and the range is 100,000 to 250 in terms of estimates the real question is that 2025 number and this is the year that they said that they will at some point on their last earnings call elon mentioned at some point they will hit 250,000 in 2025 my interpretation of that is not 250,000 for the year 2025 but a run rate of 250,000 that implies 20.8 th000 per month and my sense my guess is that hit that milestone is hit in september so when you kind of do the hockey stick ramp in production that we learned so well with model 3 and you add that all together you get that big jump from 2024 from 35,000 deliveries or production to about 175,000 and then near-term their capacity is capped out at 250 so 2026 is likely 250,000 vehicles produced i lead with a production topic because i think it's most important the demand piece seems to be in a great place they said on the last call they have more than a million reservations many of those will fall away i expect probably half of them to fall away there's a $100 fully refundable deposit so you'll see a lot of people kind of bought it for a gag potentially but i think that there's still meaningful number call it 500,000 real buyers behind that and when you think about that ramp that i talked about 1,23 3524 175,00 25 250 and 26 that gets you to 470,000 for those combined first four years and that is below what is likely the real uh penup demand number of call 500,000 over time some more of those are going to fall off and some will be added on as people s see them out and about so i kind of think that's a good back uh a good solid number as far as the demand piece and other words investors should not be concerned about demand but should be concerned about production and the reason to be concerned about production is when you look at it in the context of overall numbers so they're going to do about 1.8 million vehicles overall this year tesla will and by my math in 2025 without the cyber truck they'll have about 19 20% delivery growth with the cyber truck call it 25% growth in 202 26 they'll have call it 28 29% growth without the cyber truck and with the cyber truck call it 30% so you're looking at a few percentage increase in growth rates with the addition of what is a a spectacular vehicle that's going to catch a lot of attention that in other words there's just not that much pop to the overall delivery numbers based on the cyber tru and the reason of course is the capacity and to put this in perspective is that that 250,000 outlook for capacity for the next several years that compares to the model 3 and model y which are each around 800,000 vehicles today so the real pressure point here is how does tesla get the cybertruck production up to $800,000 a year to really have a bigger accelerating impact on overall deliveries and getting those back into 30% plus delivery growth so we're standing by for now for november 30th i can promise you this this is going to be a a grind of an of a ramp in production probably not as bad as model 3 but pretty bad patience is going to be a virtue and more importantly i think the product is going to be a smashing success i think this is really going to capture people's attention it's going to be a lot of utility for the dollar and i'm excited to see this roll out in a week or so so more to come after november 30th on behalf of deep water i'm jean bye for now"
Pressure Points: Apple's WWDC AI Updates,2024-03-27 15:20:38+00:00,8,VIu_vXzJysE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIu_vXzJysE,welcome to deep tech 315 our three topics this week are tesla and the sec potentially locking horns separately we'll talk about the apple ipad event and last talk about apple related to their chip opportunity maybe in some of their own data centers and so taking it back to the top on the morning of may 8th uh tesla there was a a roers story out and understand the history between reuters and tesla but there's a reuters story out that talked about uh the sec is considering an investigation so we got a rumored and they're considering this investigation related to this uh essentially tesla overselling fsd and the basic idea is that uh they have uh inflated to consumers and therefore that money has come in and has inflated the stock price which then crosses it into a line with the sec uh that is is now something that they're looking into and my initial reaction was not surprised to hear the sec continues to orbit it feels like this just bad blood between them and they're kind of angling at it my second was the more substance question which is uh fsd is a real product and it is in beta they don't recognize all the revenue up front and so they're doing that as these incremental upgrades come it doesn't feel like tesla is doing anything wrong here i think the question probably stems from what exactly is elon probably specifically sort of saying publicly about the capabilities of fsd is he sort of maybe implying that it can do more than what they can legally market that it does it feels like that he's pretty measured on it he'll he doesn't claim it's full self-driving yet no i think i would say though if you're right it's hard to do this this going to sound crazy put yourselves in the shoes of an sec investigator though there are probably comments that he makes where you say um that feels a little bit more aggressive than what uh perhaps ford might say or gm or one of the other automakers who are more buttoned up and i think that's just we've talked about this before with elon like that's who he is as an entrepreneur and it's almost who he has to be to build a company right the first real meaningful automaker in a hundred years you kind of have to break some eggs and i don't think you're ever going to remove that dna from him or probably tesla either so to me the question just is okay how aggressively uh is tesla allowed to talk about this product and then ultimately does that result in some sort of change where they have to market uh fsd a little differently and might that impact consumer adoption it's hard to imagine it would do it in any meaningful way but that feels like the outcome that might happen here and if this feels like deja vu you're not alone of course nits has been orbiting around this topic in different versions since 2016 with autopilots doj has been around more earlier in this year as well and so this is kind of just this stew of regulatory bodies kind of pressing against this whole fsd opportunity and they have added nags since some of the things with the department of justice and appease n i think the next version of the point upgrade that's coming with fsd is going to actually have reduced number of nags which uh think will make some of those users happy but at the end of the day like you said it comes down to how um like how aggressively they can market this i don't think that they're being too aggressive with it um and we'll see how it plays out i think again it's rumored i think nothing comes out of this is my my sense do you have any any you want to put your hat in the ring on whether anything comes out of this with the sec i bet i bet they get uh something that's slightly worse than a slap on the wrist i don't know that's how i would try to quantify where they probably have to change a little bit of the generally the same ballpark there next topic is the ipad event it's been 15 months since we've seen an ipad event uh at that time when they did upgrade the ipad sales of ipad soared 29% in a quarter besides that the other nine quarters around that event if you're following this uh the ipad has been down a lot uh in fact on over the last 10 quarters it's been down 8% i think part of it is that people are just holding nine of these devic deves longer and i think it's just generally a saturated market i also see some of the functionality with ipad starting to blur with some of the other products they're making the ipad pro for example with some of the the chips it's more comparable to a macbook pro and actually more powerful than a macbook pro and then on the flip side uh they're uh you know bringing up the ipad air to be more like the ipad pro and so there's this kind of blending of forces here and so from one respect i applaud apple i think that the features the changes that they made have been impressive but from the other p and we'll see a bump up i'm sure a sharp acceleration ipad revenue but just over the next few years i generally think this is an important category it's 7% of their business but it's probably going to be on a slow decline going forward i agree with the slow decline i would say it's you know it's not really that important a part of the business at only 7% of revenue i think it was even 6% last quarter kind of one of the trough quarters and so it doesn't it doesn't move the needle and it never will is the reality of it um it's a fun product i think about my own use cases i update my ipads less than i update my macs you know so it's it is something that you kind of you get one and you can use it for a really long time the thing though you mentioned the chips i actually thought that was the more important thing that came out of the announcement because you look at how they talked about the m4 chip they talked a lot more about ai and its powers in ai then i think they've talked about ai in almost any product release ever that they've done so far and so i do think you saw a little bit of that changing of the dna them recognizing that they need to talk about ai not just because the market the financial markets are really excited about ai and they want to know what apple's doing in ai but i also think customers want ai products like ai is not a bad word it's not like this mystical thing that people don't understand it's something that i think people get excited about now and i think they're going to talk more about that obviously at wwdc but i think across all their products as well just to put a finer point on that that chip piece it jumped out to me as well went back and looked at the gap between when the different m series chips have come out between one and two was 19 months then it went to 16 and now between three and four it's at seven months so you see them they're getting these chips out a lot faster i was surprised that they're announcing this new chip starting out with an ipad usually you'd see it obviously in the higher end macs at first and so i agree i think that they have uh they've gotten religion in a short amount of time around ai and i think are pushing their silicon hard because they can see that as a competitive advantage i also kind of read into this is it makes me now again the m chips are different than the a chips that go into the iphone but it uh makes me believe that we'll have some sort of branded ai phone not by name name necessarily in the fall but i think that they're going to really play up the ai features of course so good job there which leads us to the the final segment in terms of what apple's doing in chips mark german from bloomberg has been reporting this week a couple times related to apple uh building some of these higher-end chips and then having it in uh building some of their infrastructure and if we rewind to their last earnings call uh cfo uh luca mentioned that they're going to take kind of a two-pronged approach to building infrastructure they're going to do part of it themselves and part of it with third parties and that translation is of course doing a deal with like google or microsoft or open ai and to to power some of their models and so i hear lucas's comments or read between the lines on his comments and then i i see german who does great reporting on them wanting to do chips do they kind of want to do it both work with third parties but also try to advance their own initiatives around hardware and ai certainly seems like it and it's been their strategy in the past to your point of kind of doing a little bit of both sides i do wonder and i would say beyond wonder worry a little bit that uh i think there's value in having sovereignty as being a meaningful ai player whereby you're not reliant on some third- party hyperscaler infastructure if you're a if you're a major ai player if you're just a fortune 500 company you might want to do inference locally or something like that it's fine to rely on other people's models but i think when you're really building your own models and trying to create truly unique product i think that probably begs your own proprietary infrastructure and bigger picture i mean we've talked about this thesis before in the past i feel that every hundred billion dollar plus ai company that is a true ai company meaning they're building you know real and trying to create unique models i think they do need to all build own custom silicon it's why open ai i think is exploring it google microsoft amazon all are already there right everybody's trying to reduce reliance on nvidia and apple of all of them other than google with tpus right apple of all of them probably has the most experience designing silicon for their consumer products so you know maybe there is a world where you they've got a little bit of that experience they can uh confer that into some advanced chips and and maybe they invest more in infrastructure than they're currently thinking makes sense i don't expect apple to be selling these highend chips but clearly going into some of their infrastructure and that's a wrap on this week for deep tech 315 bye for now
Pressure Points TSLA Q1 Deliveries,2024-04-02 14:56:36+00:00,6,IvNgFGomb3E,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvNgFGomb3E,welcome to pressure points i'm jean mster our topic is google earnings before we jump into the pressure point which is their search business wanted to talk a little bit about the results and another important topic which is related to their cloud business so as for the results they exceeded revenue expectations by a percent earnings by about 3% their search business was just a little bit below expectations they missed by. 3% and as of this recording shares are trading down 52% in after hours it had a bottomed out at about 6 and a half% and the reason is related to some of the commentary from the outlook which we'll get into in the search and the pressure point top part of the topic but before i do that i wanted to shift gears and talk about the cloud business and google cloud had a great december quarter it grew at 25.7% year-over-year that compares to 22.5% the september m quarter so we saw about a 320 basis point acceleration in google cloud growth now that number was uh particularly strong when you compare it to what happened to azure azure grew at 30% up from 29% in september so they accelerated by 100 basis points so google cloud actually had a better acceleration in december relative to azure now azure is growing faster overall it is a bigger business it's 22% market share versus google cloud at 11 so still incredible what azure is doing but for google's business this was a uh a dynamic a data point that really stung shares after they reported their september quarter it showed what i think was an impressive a bounce back in the december quarter so that's the cloud business now we're going to shift to the pressure point which is related to uh the search business uh this as i mention it misf fractionally but this is the topic that just keeps orbiting in the back of investors minds how will google play itself out how will they defend their 90% plus search market share when there are these other generative search experiences that may take up some of the search share and this topic uh generally follows that investors don't believe that google's search business is going to go away it just believes that this could be not this business could not grow or maybe decline a little bit as they just get kind of uh paper cuts from across the board from other uh these new generative search experiences so uh they hit the topic right away on the earnings call first topic was just how ai is going to improve search and they gave examples about how ai is improving search today with comparison search they talked about the impact of ai on their new generative search and they which they previewed last year and more multimodal using google lens and text and combination and having ai powered results so they gave some tangible examples about how ai is being used today by google to improve search also ai tools that are used by advertisers to help build search campaigns and so i thought it was helpful it was the right call for them to address this at the very top of the earnings call i don't think it really satisfied investors the question came up again during the q&a and and the q&a the question was have you seen any impact in your search business relative to what the other generative experiences are out there and they didn't answer the question just kind of went back to this we're an innovative company we've innovated around search in the past we're going to continue to innovate around search but they did not specifically answer the question about competition and when you miss the search number by. 3% fractional is it generally still means that this topic about how google is going to navigate the competitive environment is still alive and well and this topic is probably going to orbit the google investment thesis for the next few years now at deep water we're invested in google and we believe that what they have around search in the 20 plus years of leading intention data is a competitive advantage and ultimately will train a foundation model that is one of the top foundation models in google will benefit from that but that topic is still alive and well and kind of adding to some of that concern was cfo ruth pat's commentary when she gave the outlook and she talked about growth in 2024 and said that it will be uh her words uh sustaining healthy growth off of a larger base and when you use the words larger base that is code word for analysts and investors to expect lower growth numbers when companies are pointing out that they have a larger base they're hinting you got to keep your numbers lower so going into the earnings call the street was looking for about 11 and a half% topline growth for google in 2024 i suspect that that number will probably drift to around 9% after these model revisions so and then a separate piece is they had some commentary about capex mending and they said in 2024 we expect investment in capex will be notably larger than in 2023 uh that also means that uh there is a potential impact on margins capex is can be a little bit deceiving about how it impacts margins because there's a depreciation uh component to it and how it's accounted for it's not operating expenses for example but in general what i i think investors heard there is we're still in an aggressive investment cycle and so when you put that combination of the commentary about larger numbers and then the capex it kind of left investors wondering when's the exciting part of google story going to kick in as i mentioned deep water we are invested here we do think they're going to play an outsize role we still think this is one of the best position companies to benefit from ai longer term so i'm going to leave it there on behalf of google earnings i'm jean bye for now
DeepTech315: Tesla Deliveries & Robotaxi,2024-04-06 17:51:49+00:00,14,f4dfyI0HT7A,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4dfyI0HT7A,"welcome to a special edition of pressure points that's andrew murphy behind that vision pro and i'm jean monster and our topic today of course is vision pro and i'm going to start with the punchline the pressure point and then we're going to back up 16 steps and talk about the significance of this with apple and their product lineup we're going to talk about the hardware experience the user interface and what our own experience has been at with the device for the last call 3 days and so uh just from the most high level the the impact to the business is that going into this weekend i had thought that this would be about 15% of apple's revenue caught in 5 to 10 years from now more closer to 10 than five and after experiencing using the device and andrew had spent a lot of time with it as well our our conclusion is this is probably 10% of the business similar to what the mac and the ipad are so when you think about this in the pantheon of apple products think of this is another ipad another mac something that's important it's not as game-changing as the iphone is will continue to be and i'm going to pause there andrew because i i love the kind of the the arc of this conversation just jumping into this impact on apple's overall or where this sits and kind of how jobs felt about this when he kicked things off with the iphone in these big devices well everyone's wondering how big is this is this going to be a dud is this going to replace my phone um how big is vision pro for apple and for the world for uh users of consumer technology devices and um after using it for a few days i feel like uh i've got a better hold on how important this will be in terms of my personal computing um in the years to come and i think that can help us size the business bottom line is i came independently to a similar conclusion as you but i was uh wanting to go back to that u moment that you and i shared um at the mac world keynote in 2006 2007 when steve jobs took the stage and and he was reflective almost sentimental kind of pacing back and forth uh i went back and read the quote what he said to the crowd at mcone that day was this is a day i've been looking forward to for two and a half years every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything one's very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these products in your career and apple has been very fortunate it's been able to introduce a few of these into the world and then he went on to introduce iphone to the world um he was right uh that uh he was on stage that day introducing a revolutionary product and you and i have been fortunate uh even since then to watch apple introduce ipad apple watch and now vision pro uh can be added to the list of these potentially breakthrough category creating products that apple has inv ed um so where does vision pro stand on that list i think those devices each sit on a spectrum of utility the iphone being the highest in my opinion i use it all the time uh every day uh dozens of times per day hundreds probably probably too much right um uh the apple watch is something i bought on day one i use it every day i look at it hundreds of times a day and i've worn it every day since i bought my first apple watch years ago the ipad has been different for me um i have one i don't use it as often maybe once twice a month and uh as such i upgrade it less frequently my personal habits and practices with these devices are somewhat reflected at least correlated with the size of each of those businesses for apple like you were saying the iphone's about half of apple's revenue and that's why um you know it's it's half of apple's revenue because it is such a useful device to so many people and the ipad is a much smaller business because its utility is much lower where does vision pro sit on that spectrum after using it for a few days i think it's much less useful than an iphone phone for a few different reasons we can talk about um it's probably more useful longterm than something like airpods or um an apple watch even um price factors in here because we're talking about revenue so i think it's somewhere similar to the ipad a device that um is an extra computer uh that some of us use for some things every day and many of us don't need at all um and as such i i think that your initial gut reaction when you used it that apple vision pro could be or the vision product line would eventually be about 105% of apple's revenue seems to sit right with me so we we'll uh so we're basically on the same page i was at 15 now i'm closer to 10 you're at 10 but that gives probably the most important perspective on this but we're going to dive into different components of this the experience we're to start with a hardware piece and i would sum up my hardware experience as i tested it back when it was first announced in june of 2023 it was a relatively short test call it 20 minutes the as i as i started to use it longer i would sum it up as the two best parts about using vision pro are putting it on and taking it off and the the hardware piece is really tough for me to get comfortable with i had experienced some motion sickness like walking around with it felt heavy when you put it on just feels heavy uh it is uh you know kind of leaves a a mark there's this sense when you're in it uh and you're enjoying things and we're going to get to the things that i really enjoyed about it but from the hardware perspective of kind of wanting to break through it and i was curious did you have that same feeling of like i'm in this but i kind of want to break i did have that feeling a couple times in fact i've been wearing it now for eight minutes and i will take it off uh not because i need to but um just to show a few features of it um the computer in this device the the the chips the display um the technology they've packed into this you know goggles shaped uh device is unlike anything i've ever experienced the vid the cameras um the ability to process the cameras in real time um even even i've used a lot of different headsets the magnetic uh enclosure or the magnetic attachment of the light seal um the the band and the way that it attaches to your head the way that you can tighten it using the hardware is uh night and day and lighty years better than any other headset that got but it's still a heavy headset not to mention the battery pack that keeps you kind of tethered to the desk if you've got it on the desk um or tethered to your pocket or kind of the cord behind you um it's handy to put the battery pack in your pocket but there's these trade-offs that they've obviously made with gen one that um will get result solved over time but they will be an impediment to adoption too mh comfort is certainly one of them in addition to some of those other hardware features where just the weight weighs on you know you can see the mark above my head forehead um under my eyes i think it's a big deal like for the mainstream adoption this like this has to be version one underlying exclamation point because uh that we need to get some a form factor that's lighter that uh doesn't have the social stigma attached to it now you were brave more brave than i i was and you actually took this out into the wild and and used it at a a sporting event h yeah i did and what was the reaction from people around you when you pulled this out well i wanted to capture spatial video my daughter had a volleyball uh tournament over the weekend and i thought i wanted to uh try to experience what like a courtside spatial video would be like um and uh so i pulled it out of my backpack i i told the other parents i was sitting nearby that i was going to nerd out for a minute and use this new vision pro and i got a lot of questions um but i will say that i uh i wanted to do it as um uh secretively as i could uh i'm not totally sure why but i didn't want to attract attention or yeah you feel sort of and maybe weird or like standing out and you could build a case that 10 years now there'll be 30 parents in the audience that have them but probably not and i didn't want to embarrass my 14-year-old too much either yeah i took a 26 second long video and uh you also did hear about it afterwards when we were talking you also mentioned it's just heavy to kind of it's a commitment to carry it around yeah um unfortunately i'm i'm i've got a killer backpack i can i can pack for two or three days in in a small backpack and when you're traveling right every every ounce matters traveling with vision pro is a serious commitment right you're it's like bringing a pair of running shoes on an overnight work trip or something right you're it's it's going to take up most of your backpack and and weigh it down and just on that size and that travel piece when i picked it up it's deep water owns this device it's not android or ours it's for the firm we're going to be investing in companies that are building applications around this so it's important that we have one and as we as i purchase it they offer me apple care and i said no and immediately i realized this is uh $4,000 almost uh with taxes and everything we should get that so based on that kind of the feel a lot better the way that the the cover attaches that that made me feel okay about throwing it in my bag but the lenses are still exposed on the inside and so we we upgraded that we added apple rugged by any means $25 a month for apple care call it 600 a year you could buy two years in advance for 500 so but you probably want to get apple care with this too it just kind of makes it even more expensive on top of everything so from if i was going to kind of uh sum up the hardware and i want you to do the same here and sum up hardware uh it just i realized like this is not going to be a mainstream device and its current form factor it's just too heavy and there's too many people probably like me who get a little bit motion sickness yeah you bring up motion sickness too the the another important piece of the hardware is the video pass through and i've noticed some people get very sensitive to any kind of blurriness in in the headset and i personally feel like it's uh a little bit of a fuzzy version of reality um i my mind normalizes to the video pass through pretty quickly um summarizing the hardware it's unlike any other headset i've ever used um you know 10 times better kind of a thing than a quest for example and still not light enough for mainstream adoption or very long sessions of use love it let's go on a second topic here which is the user interface what were your initial thoughts yeah super fun to experience a a whole new design interaction paradigm from apple for the first time right when the home screen of apps appears in front of you uh it's sort of one of those you got to see it to believe it moments um that uh was fun just a special special thing for people that have been using computers and nerding out about apple products for decades um even those that haven't that um are familiar with iphones or a mac um i think are also instantly familiar with the user interface settings is everything is familiar there of where to find your subscriptions photo yeah but i i jumped over the most important point i think which is the gesture recognition um it it's amazing that apple has been able to continue to innovate on user interface from the mac point and click with the mouse to the ipod with the scroll wheel just very naturally scrolling through your list of songs to multi-touch with the iphone pinching and zooming and looking at photos or apps or i mean for a company to go four for four on a new interface with the gesture control the eye tracking and the gesture recognition is 10 out of 10 i think lights out they nailed it and it works um incredibly intuitively for young people old people um people that are from familiar with headsets and people that aren't um that's something i think only apple can do and puts them instantly ahead in the race for the headset uh category if spatial computing is something that grows you know to be an increasing share of our computing paradigms agree across the board won't add much to what you said but want to emphasize something it is a out of 10 it's so good the eye tracking and the gestures and the clicking and all that it's so good that it almost is eerie at times as it's reading your mind and so great job apple on the interface front uh let's switch to vision os and talk apps well just the operating system itself um again is instantly recognizable and yet uh a whole new paradigm um siri works flawlessly right that's uh easy to easy to use it's actually one of the easier ways to input text um i think the other thing about the os that uh surprised me having used a lot of different headsets with augmented reality was that the windows when they're in front of you in space stay in position right those objects are anchored in space rock solidly and that that is different than any other uh headset that i've used and i think it's important to make it's a big deal yeah just to make it useful and um and uh easy simple uh to the point where i could go in a different room come back and my desktop or my itunes window is still in the same place that i left it and if you go behind it you can see the back of it which is white by the way uh i've never seen what the back of an application window looks like until vision pro and apparently they're white um but that that solid anchoring i think adds a ton to the vision os experience and uh yeah and then you start downloading apps and and surrounding yourself with apps and and trying all sorts of different use cases before we jump into the apps i want to give you my or recant my experience here is that the ease that you could bring your existing apple world into it it was a login you knew exactly where to find it you don't need instructions to figure out how to use it but you log into your icloud account and all of a sudden your videos start uh dropping in there you get your text messages phone calls it just was seamless so from the os perspective just awesome how about apps uh what apps jumped out to you as being most valuable that's kind of seems to be one of the bigger questions yeah what did i download in order i think it was well remember this is a work device so i i downloaded zoom i downloaded slack i downloaded microsoft word so these are most of these are just existing iphone apps that have been ported over uh each uh let's see the slack app is the ipad version of slack so it really it's not optimized for spatial it's kind of just two dimensional ipad the zoom app is a native vision os app okay and i think the word application is also a native vision os app but it's very much what you would expect a two-dimensional word processing by the way those don't feel like true vision os apps when yeah so another app that i downloaded was fruit ninja and um that was i mean i'm not a huge gamer uh i've played fruit ninja before in different on different devices like an ipad um but i thought it' be cool to use my hands and the gesture recognition to slice the fruit and play the game um i found it to be okay um i think my hands were moving so fast fast that the they weren't being recognized when i slowed them down to slice the fruit it was a lot better my experience with third-party apps though so far has either been kind of what you would expect like with slack or they're not quite there yet okay and it's really like the apple tv app with some of those immersive videos or um i guess uh disney plus is a third- party app that got a lot of use over the weekend um or the meditation app right like that that truly immersive three-dimensional the the app ecosystem is not there yet in summary agree officially they've got a million plus but those are iphone apps ipad apps ported over uh they got 600 apps that are optimized for vision os so we'll see that grow my expectations probably 2,000 plus by the end of the year next topic is the video experiences and this before we move on from apps sorry i i will say um i was um on the vision os side one feature that i think is an obvious and hopefully urgent feature that they add is uh multiple user accounts on a single device that would be super handy for a family so that you can not you know so you don't have to log out and log back into your icloud gu accounts but those don't don't really cut it right i think multiple user accounts was it it took a while to bring that to ios even and um the apple tv and i think it'll come i was a little surprised though that they couldn't get that ready to ship on on day one because it it really does help share and build excitement amongst a group yeah we're logging in the office we're in out and deleting our data and put back it up it's kind of it's clumsy video experiences this was the one back in june 23 demoed it with the spatial video that was just i thought this is going to totally redefine how memories are iphone 15 comes out i wasn't going to buy iphone 15 they announc this is in september that it's going to be able to capture spatial video i buy iphone 15 a month two months later it comes out you can they announced the feature a couple months later and i start capturing so i had captured probably 30 or so videos in spatial uh going into this so once i logged in and updated it i got to experience those videos again and i can say this exceeded my expectations i had high expectations around spatial it exceeded it to the point where like i just i was just got lost in watching these and it it does bring you back it's hard to yeah you feel like you are there feel like you are there you're sitting in the room with people back when that video uh like emotional for me the one thing i did not like about it is there's this kind of at least for the spatial video shot with the iphone there's this kind of dreamy effect on the edges of the video now the video that you shot of that volleyball game it didn't have it it it kind of captured most of the screen but the the videos are getting captured with your iphone um but just these snippets and i just think for capturing memories it's powerful check the box for me that was a success and but you when we talked about it too you said they're cool but you can't do them for long um i may have been talking about the actual immersive videos like like the 3d movies and things like that 3d movies and stuff like that yeah so what's not long like 10 minutes is that yeah i i haven't um so let's see backing up on video there's three different kinds of videos i encountered that well four um normal two-dimensional videos right where you're looking at a pain and you may be surrounded by an immersive experience but it's really just a two-dimensional video pain then there was a similar experience with 3d movies that are limited to a paint but they're three dimension uh there's different layers in the video and sort of like a 3d movie at the theater with glasses on um then there's immersive 3d experiences the one that i kept showing people was an apple tv video where a woman is uh slacklining above the fjords in norway or something like that um very high peaks se that for like eight years from that wasn't that kind of the basic idea of the original you put a phone on a device and you're looking at vr yeah and and it's different in vision pro i think uh either the quality of the cameras and or just the the vision pro fidelity right um audio and visual uh it it gives people um the sense sensation of being up on that cliff to the point where they're spooked i' actually i'm curious to hear your thoughts yeah i get i get motion sick just even thinking about that yeah i know just not to throw you or not to not to expose too much but i know you also have fear of heights and i'm wondering what if if you experience your fear in that video uh try it out and let us know uh then there's the spatial videos that the vision pro or the iphone 15 pro can capture and then you watch back and that's the most magical of of all of the of all the video uh categories and i did that volleyball one to try to give people the um experience of what it would be like to sit courtside and watch a well produced nba game on vision pro unfortunately it's 14 year old girls playing volleyball and it's not quite that same experience but here's my guess my guess is it's going to be amazing for 10 minutes then you're gonna want to take it off and then probably go on and watch it for another 10 minutes yeah by the time they can produce something like that uh friday night baseball in in uh spatial video or the nba finals in spal video my the device won't weigh as much right doesn't the hardware i mean it's going to be incredible these experien are going to be incredible but doesn't the hardware basically prevent us from truly experiencing them right now right now it does for a long time yeah it does and what what's what do you think what's the threshold for you terms of for me it's 10 minutes but i'm a glasses wear oh oh the the time duration time duration like how much you watch longer sessions i did some longer sessions 20 30 minutes with the um headband that uh goes over the top of your head head and um i didn't have any dizziness or motion sickness um for me i could do 30 minutes to an hour uh using the device uh where i was okay i had a little eye strain at the end i had a headache because of the pressure on my forehead but i'm okay for 30 to 60 minutes there was two or three other people out of 10 that i showed who were within a minute or two um too dizzy didn't like it and want to take it off so maybe that's the right way to think about this is that piece of it's maybe 20 or 30% of the population so anything more on video before we jump into kids reaction no so with kids uh i've got a couple kids i don't want them messing around with this uh andrew you're you're more brave uh what was your experience they a little older a little older they they've shown themselves to be pretty responsible with with screens um one moment that i thought captured it was after uh my older daughter had used it once enjoyed it she did the dinosaur thing she actually got spooked by the dinosaur um like she was uh her mind was tricked right into thinking that it was realish or scary at least um so she liked it a lot and wanted to use it throughout the weekend um but i saw her on the couch at one point uh just kind of wanting to veg out after uh this volleyball tournament that she was at and um the vision pro was sitting right next to her and i had the thought that uh an iphone with tik tock to a teenager is really stiff competition for vision pro and that's the case with us and our laptops too or us and our phones um we're getting to the point where um the spectrum of computing is pretty well well saturated by apple devices right if i'm exercising a watch is great if i'm at my desk a laptop is great um if i'm on the go on a subway my phone is great so we're pretty well covered and there's a lot of competition across that spectrum for vision pro and i i i think she's more um in i think kids in general are hooked on their phones because they're convenient um you can whip it out of your pocket muscle memory opens up tick tock in two seconds and you're scrolling two seconds later and with vision pro it's put the headset on wait for 15 seconds for it to boot up yeah and there's no tik tok today there will be i'm sure yeah and and who knows when when tik tok does come out like is that immersive and and cool enough to want you to to i could see tik tock and spatial be a thing well this is where i think you and i get most excited is the possibilities of new businesses that are newly possible because of this new device and the value that'll unlock for people and for investors that invest in these types of companies like what is the uber of vision pro what is the instagram of vision pro or the tik tok of vision pro we don't know yet but that's exciting to consider do you think that from like a gaming perspective that this from a kids and gaming perspective this is kind of has that potential where kids will put it on and just have it on for five hours like they sit in front of their playstation um i do i i think that uh i remember even as a kid like playing video games for too long and you get kind of a headache or uh you know either too much mountain dew or too much nintendo but you get lost in something that is uh so stimulating and vision pro is certainly on that on that level even despite the the weight and things like that i think yeah that's i think there's real concern around mental health eye health um just mental wellness in general uh that we should be aware of and and conscious of and apple's done a good job with screen time limits that feature does exist in vision pro so you can we got get an eye doctor on here and have them talk about what the impact of these devices are for a different top for a different pressure point uh let's uh wrap anything more on the kids fromont before we go to general thoughts no more your general takeaway h well we hit up at the top um just that i i do think uh this is a new category of computing and one that i think will move the needle for apple i think it's uh much smaller than the iphone i don't think it will replace the phone um at least in in the next decade or two um so i think it's much smaller than that then you're looking at bus or or businesses or categories that are smaller for apple and um and i think this fits somewhere in there near the ipad in terms of uh usefulness um over the weekend i used the vision pro a lot more than i thought i would i put it through its paces and tried almost every use case i could um to see what's it like to watch a baseball game in vision pro uh what what's it like to play a game what's it like to facetime what i i tried it all um love it and uh when i come away from it i i think it's still not obvious to me what i would be dying to do on day one if i bought a vision pro personally and that wasn't the case for iphone um it was immediately obvious to me that i would love to have the desktop class internet in my pocket and it was immediately obvious to me with the app watch that i wanted to track my fitness and exercise and workouts every day and i've done that every day since vision pro it's not obvious to me and and you could say wait till the future generation we know this is going to get better or we know there's going to be more apps and stuff like that but with the iphone and the apple watch you didn't need to wait it was immediately obvious what was capable and what you wanted to do and why you would want to buy this device device that's why i think it's more similar to the ipad um which for me wasn't and still isn't totally obvious like what i love to do on my ipad that i can't do anywhere else uh so my general takeaway is that this is an exciting paradigm shifting device that is sort of similar to the ipad in terms of my personal computing and i'm excited to see what spatial computing brings us from here love it my take away is this is going to be a long road it's a worthy road for apple to go on to i'm in that population where the headset itself was prohibitive to how much i can use it and look forward to lighter versions and maybe even someday some form of glasses that's a long long ways away just from a techn from a tech perspective but i do believe the concept of immersion and look forward to how different apps can be built i think the best use case for this is somebody who's working at home two days a week because you can just put it on in your office you can teleport to your to be with your other workers you got some amazing screens around you you can take it on and off throughout the day that to me is the initial target market for probably the next year or so so uh safe to say andrew uh we are optimistic about this long term but know it's going to take time so i'm going to wrap us up right there we'll further updates as we continue to use different apps and things jump out at us this is a topic that is going to be front and center for us for a long time so on behalf of andrew myself and pressure points bye for now"
Frontier & Center: GitLab,2024-04-09 21:07:13+00:00,9,QQ6tfVKYpaE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ6tfVKYpaE,"welcome to deep tech 315 our three topics today are what is the status of the potential for a ticktock band second we're going to talk about layoffs at tesla what it means for the company deliveries profitability and last we're going to uh give some our uh perspective on some comments from tsm about the overall chip market slowing a little bit more than what they had believed before still growing but not growing as fast as kind of what they they thought the industry would grow up before so we'll go back to the top uh it is tick tock as a reminder about a month ago the house voted that they wanted tik tock to be divested they had six months to divest once it was signed into law president biden had said that he would sign that in so it was waiting on the senate the senate goes slower than the house and it was expected to take a few months for the senate to vote on this but as the senate was looking at it they were giving feedback to the house saying that the time for divesture was too aggressive that they felt that they should give them more time so to try to move the bill forward uh the house is now added an amendment to it or is voting to amend it to basically give tik tock a year once it's voted into law to figure out its divesture so going from six months to a year uh this is being folded into a broader uh package that includes aid to the ukraine and i believe something related to israel so unclear whether that's even going to see the light of day but what stuck out to me is uh this matters tik tock matters it matters because if you look at what happened to snap stock on news that they were going to try to fasttrack this or respond in anticipation to what some of the senate's concerns were the stock traded up 7% meta at the moment that that was announced traded up about a percent and a half on this and of course3 million 100 million people in the us use tik tock daily so they they care about this and uh i want to finish kind of my thoughts on this and gonna turn over to you dog but my big picture is there is energy in the house to try to get this banned there is a momentum or uh some commentar as i mentioned from biden the house vot in was 352 to 65 in favor of a band which is surprisingly uh uh unified there and then it comes down to who's going to win the presidency because all this is going to naturally fall on the next president's desk and if you look at the odds it's basically 50/50 now if we were talking a few weeks ago trump was favored i'd say comfortably favored now it's kind of a coin toss here so putting all of it together stirring it up what's your take just the beauty of our government in motion how long things take i mean we were talking about this four years ago go donald trump signed an executive order before he left office uh and then president biden then signed an order to overturn president trump's order so we've kind of been messing around for four years originally was in favor of keeping tick tok well his his order overturned the the uh order that president trump had signed for i think it was another uh body of the government to essentially investigate more as if we needed more information at that point that tik tok was doing the farious things i i just think uh all this motion is great but when you've been working on something for four years and it still hasn't happened um i don't think it makes any sense to pat anybody in the back i mean if we think that this is an issue with national security it should have been done a long time ago um that's the reality of it and it seems like there's some general consensus that you know the united states is built on freedom we're built on free speech but we don't want to allow platforms that uh encourage domestic espionage in some ways or domestic sabotage uh in some ways from uh foreign adversaries so let's just get it done and the biggest fear is we're actually talking about the four-year cycle we're back into a new cycle now where who knows what happens here if we have a change in office president trump has said he has changed his stance on the tik tock band so we might be talking about this in four years from now as well makes sense i don't know how it's going to all play out i do share your views that this should be banned programming note i am not a tik tock user so easy for me to say let's jump to our second topic tesla had some headcount reductions this i believe did not catch our last episode last week and uh they are cutting call it around 10% announced earlier this week and what i think this speaks to elon said that there's some redundancies loves being efficient of course he wrote the book on that with twitter entered with about 8,000 employees and it was estimated that he cut it down to at 1 point 1500 so call it an 80% headcount reduction so he definitely wants to get more out of people the tesla executives that i've talked to and tesla employees who have left over the years always talk about that they get worked really hard so i wonder how much of the 10% cut is really needed and or versus him just trying to kind of force the the issue but i would say my my central uh takeaway here is that the delivery numbers for 2024 are still too high for tesla they are the street as of this recording is looking for 5% delivery growth if you take what they just reported for the march deliveries call 370,000 deliveries and grow that at 10% sequentially for this year which i think is been on the favorable side of the equation that's going to get deliveries for the full year to be down 5% so i suspect when they report on the 23rd we're probably going to see some revisions down there and i think that this headcount reduction is re is in reaction to uh what is a different ev environment i think the bottom line is tesla's just in this uh everything is bad news cycle right now i mean often times and particularly in tech over the last 18 24 months when we've had these job cuts the market has tended to react favorably to it they did not in the case of test and i think that's just the reality of this this compounding um number of questions around the stock what's happening with model 2 if we've got price cuts with fsd why are we cutting price on you know your most exciting product in many ways um and what can we really expect from robo taxi you know i think the number of unanswered questions just skews investors to say hey their their cutting head count uh that can only be a bad thing it can only mean bad things for demand right and so uh until tesla can find a way to get out of that negative cycle you know it's it's going to be a tough tough road for them i think in the nearer term i'm glad you did mention the what's going on in fsd robotaxi we should kind of fill in some updates on that front as well is that they are um reuters is now doubling down on what they said and that model two is cancelled that's what we had said a week or two ago that that's basically on hold and that they are fully pursuing robotaxi and elon has said that uh he's i think it was his quote was balls to the wall for robo taxi and autonomy if not um you're just a carriage a horse carriage something like that so it feels like they're really he's building the the line around what's going to happen in autonomy august 8 but what's what's it going to take though like talking about this negative news cycle what do you think turns the tide for them like how do people get positive it's just they need a quarter over the last seven quarters margins have gone down six to the last seven quarters sequentially there's one quarter that was flat the gross margins now 17.5% it peak at 29 and a half percent as i mentioned seven quarters ago they just need some stability need to move that in the right direction or they need to move deliveries start to grow again they just need some good news because when you come off of such a high growth phase and numbers keep going down people don't know where the bottom is and so investors are just keep guessing that it's uh maybe lower i think ultimately the pendulum is is swinging too far negative here i've been positive much higher so keep that in context but i think that's what's going on is what's it going to take it doesn't take for them to figure autonomy out they just need to show that electrification is there's a bid in the consumer market for electric cars and that they're growing their deliveries year-over-year yeah momentum is great when you have it in your favor and it's brutal when you don't they just don't have it right now well to brings us to our final topic which is is tsm this is a in our in uh one of our holdings at deep water and the uh they of course are the company that makes the chips for companies like nvidia and apple and have been powering the ai uh this this infrastructure build and they reported they report their kind of their units on a monthly basis so when they actually report the quarter there's not too much mystery around it but they do have commentary about kind of how things are looking forward and they did talk about this incredible demand that they can't keep up with the ai chips are about i thought they said 10% of their total 9% of their total business today they expect it to be 20% in year 2028 so that is growing really nicely but the piece that has spooked markets and the stock today is this comment that they expect the overall industry to grow at 10% previously they had talked about more than 10% kind of this um generic comment about more more than 10% when i put it all al together it feels like so what if the overall chip industry is down i'm trying to get the read through to the ai infrastructure like 70 or 80 90% of their business you kind of forget about it don't you when you're looking to try to figure out what's actually going on with ai it seems like the market's not forgetting about it entirely just given that the stock's down a little bit as we're recording this post earnings but that's my view is that you know look i think we were all sort of thinking this semiconductor uh slowdown kind of demand around consumer electronics auto we were kind of getting through the hard part getting out of the woods on some of that stuff and it feels like the commentary said hey maybe we're just not quite there yet and uh i don't know that that's that big of a deal it feels more like a timing issue you know i think auto will come back um i think the consumer demand we've long talked about the potential for sort of an aid driven upgrade cycle at some point for the consumer electronic space so that could be a future tailwind uh so to me it's just it's more delay in terms of timing that was probably a little bit disappointing for investors positive thing though if you think about the read through for the broader semispace in ai was they talked about revenue there growing double or sorry uh over double not double digits over double over 100% year year yeah and then 50% kager for the next several years in the ai space so that space still feels like it's growing incredibly fast uh probably as as we would hope them to say yeah that i mean there's so much dependent on our outlook over the next 3 five years on making sure that the ai infrastructure is getting built at a at a at a speedy rate and their commentary would support that so uh i was encouraged next stop i next big stop i believe will be nvidia and that is they're kind of on an off cycle quarter so that's probably going to be it's an april quarter takes them a month to kind of put things together so it probably puts it early june before we uh hear from them does that sound right early june i guess right and we got we got the mega caps next week though that'll be mega caps next week pit stop on the way to nvidia i gu yeah it's like it's gonna be a big pit stop next week i'm looking forward to that on behalf of deep tech 315 bye for now"
DeepTech315: Inflation vs AI / Robotaxi / Future of AI,2024-04-10 20:40:03+00:00,15,xpw_Paw4wSU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpw_Paw4wSU,for deep water asset management i'm gene munster the topic today is why tesla is the winner in the united auto workers negotiations three points first we're going to talk about what the strike is all about second we're going to talk about the current and future gap between cost per hour of a worker from united auto worker unions versus tesla and third we're going to talk about the bigger picture the transition to electric and what all this means for that dynamic and going back to the top in terms of what's at stake there are several factors here i'm going to highlight three first the wage increase that the united auto workers are looking for they originally wanted a 40 wage increase they've backed that off to a 35 percent as of this recording which is about 12 hours before the the uh the the deadline second is they want a 32-hour work week also to make more money that 35 more money but on a 32 hour work week down from 40 hour work week and last they want protection for those those workers that are working in powertrain that includes engines and transmissions those of course are going to get upended in the next decade with electrification your engine goes away you still have a form of transmission with a motor but essentially there's going to be a retooling on that and people are going to lose their jobs they want protection for that understandably sell but that's essentially what is the kind of the dynamic that's at stake second is outlining the difference between the cost structure of tesla versus the big three and this comes in part from reporting from axios in the washington post but it stands today this is before the negotiations is the big three pay on average this includes the your hourly wage pensions and profit sharing about 66 dollars per hour average tesla worker is about 48 dollars an hour as i mentioned the gap right now is the uwa wants a 35 wage increase and the auto the big three are kind of right around at 20 at the time this recording let's say it nets out to a 25 wage increase that would take the overall plan overall comp plan again including pensions and profit sharing up by about 20 it wouldn't be up as much as the wage increase and so if you put that that gets the average hourly rate just below 80. 79 to be exact and so that would put the gap between the big three auto worker per hour and tesla to be 79 versus 48 which is about a 65 percent more or less gap and so big gap there but that's not where the story ends when this goes through when this negotiations end undoubtedly tesla is going to want to give their workers a pay raise or they will want a pay raise even though they're not part of a union but i'm assuming that there's going to be kind of a 15 pay raise for tesla workers in the next year as part of this changing dynamic and at that point that would put the cost differential between traditional auto and tesla somewhere between 40 and 45 percent after everything is said and done before all this started it was about a 37 gap and so and that is it's going to get worse for the big three relative to tesla when it comes to cost per hour of manufacturing labor and the last piece the most important thing is that traditional auto is in the red when it comes to electrification and they will continue to be in the red my belief is for two plus years now most of them don't give data related to this topic there's going to be of course the initial hit when they announced the strike and most believe that a 10-day strike is going to cost the industry five billion dollars that's not the really important part the important part is just the transition to electrification some of the losses ford again is the only company that has really given details about their transition electric and some of the losses they're expecting this year to have a loss of four and a half billion dollars that initially was a three billion dollar loss but they upped that since some of the price wars that have gone on and some of them lower the price price of for lowering the price of their cars so it's a four and a half billion dollars they're expecting to produce 600 000 electric vehicles sometime in 20 20 24 sometime middle of next year uh that's about six to nine months behind what their initial target was so that continues to kind of lag behind and when you put this together is tesla in the june quarter produced about 10 times as many electric cars globally as the big three did in the u.s and so there's a big advantage that tesla has just in terms of production which obviously creates more efficiency which is one of the reasons why tesla is in the black when it comes to making evs kind of a high teens gross margin when it comes to their car business and as i think about this delta that's going to increase between the cost to labor for traditional auto versus tesla that will just further put pressure on this transition for the big three and it is going to come in the form manifest itself likely in the form where tesla continues to keep prices lower and that continues to keep the big three in the red and i suspect it's going to be two plus years it could be even longer before the big three starts to see some profitability in electric and i continue to believe that ultimately that some of these car companies that have been kind of the cornerstone of how we've thought about cars the last hundred years will be a fraction of their size in the future which ones are at most risk hard to say but i think that what's going on with the cost of labor is an important dynamic about that transition to ev and dynamic that has going to only increase in tesla's favor in the weeks to come on behalf of deep water asset management i'm gene munster bye for now thank you
DeepTech315: TikTok Ban / Tesla Layoffs / Chip Market,2024-04-19 15:00:43+00:00,13,wCS5QC610LM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCS5QC610LM,"[music] welcome to pressure points our topic is wwdc and while there were several layers to the event i'll jump right into the pressure point which is will the new ai features be enough to motivate apple's base to upgrade their hardware more frequently and therefore allow apple to exceed estimates over the next few years and so let me take a couple steps back stay within that pressure point is when i previewed the event a few days ago and talked about siri being the pressure point one piece that i missed was that these new ai features are going to require you to have an iphone 15 pro uh or later and also on the mac and ipad side an m1 chip or later and so effectively 85% of the devices out there will not be able to run these experiences and so that creates this question which is will the features be enough to get people to get excited and before i jump into why i believe that they'll be enough to cause a better than expected cycle over the next few years some context is that it's true that all the features that we saw today are features that we have seen over the past year and demoed by open ai and microsoft and we've seen gemini and all their examples so while this is nothing new for those of us who are following this most people are not following this most people have heard of ai have maybe episodically used it but in the case of integrating this within apple's devices it gives an opportunity first for these generative experiences to be more tailored to people they refer to being personalized ai and that's because some of those features run on apple's small language models on device and in their private cloud which is allows you to do things on your personal data for example use your emails to index and be able to search those through ai compose emails do proofing you could have imessage uh different features whether it's generating uh different experiences for what you're sending out message or being able to organize messages and in photos to be able to better organize your photos search photos and uh generate and make adjustments to photos so all those uh that generative ai experience that small language model experience is power powered by apple and that's something that users would have never been able to do unless apple rolled in this integration the second reason why i think it's exciting is that they're really taking the friction out of using ai i oftentimes get asked jean you're so excited about ai how do i actually experience it people don't know you have to go out and sign up to gemini or or gpt and and and get an account in the case of apple they're just going to make all these products run seamlessly they're not charging for them explicitly but they are making them run uh seamlessly in the case of uh the more advanced pieces they're doing they also will allow you to summon gpt in siri and through other experiences like doing emails and for generative text uh but to do that you don't have to set up a open ai account a gpt account you can just go and it just it works and so that piece that apple does so well of making technology easy for us to use i think that is going to be a moment for people to get uh wanting these new devices and again i think that it's going to take time for this to build the initial there's going to be a wave of people who get excited about initially once they get those devices in their hands call it the december quarter this year they'll show them to their friends and i think people will increasingly get excited about upgrading and so that's the pressure point i want to jump into a couple more topics one is related to the technology piece and so as i mentioned there are some pieces of apple's ai experiences that are powered by their small language model that's a three billion parameter model 3b as in boy billion and that is important because in context to the gpt model that they're integrating with which is likely a a one trillion t as in tango one trillion parameter model that's a large language model apple's using a small language model but these are night and day in terms of how advanced they are and so they both come together to create these ai generative experiences but when you think about kind of the substance of the most exciting parts of what ai can do you really are going to have to opt into what's going on with opt in a gpt uh which apple's going to make it easy to do that it does big a question that i've had in my mind about what uh apple's future is in ai and ultimately do they have control of their destiny this is the same question that i have regarding microsoft and amazon and their need to partner with third parties but i just want to point out that there's a pretty big distinction about the the what the power of these models are but again from the consumer perspective they're really not going to care they're just going to be able to do some things that they've never been able to do and i think that will be positive for the upgrade cycle and i would be remiss not to mention that while siri kept her its name it ultimately got a huge upgrade and is going to do a lot more in part through their small language model but also you'll be able to opt in and do siri with gpt and capitalize on that bigger model and so i think the siri experience not just through voice but they have a text option too is going to be something that people are going to get excited about so i think there's a lot of reason to be enthusiastic over the next three years about what's going to happen with device growth not just iphone but mac and ipad too the last piece i wanted to talk about is just some historical context and shares traded off 2% on this of course they've been up 15% over the past month well the nasdaq has been up 5% so it's understandable there's one natural buy in the rumors sell on the news but i think that today was a big event and i would put it as big of an event as the iphone coming out which may sound like i'm out of touch by making that comparison but if you look at what has come out since the iphone is come out kind of in reverse order we have vision pro we have in 2019 apple tv plus arcade and news plus and then uh rewinding further 2015 apple watch we had the ipad we had the app store that's basically has been kind of the con the the the contour of product announcements from apple the last c 15 years and back in 2007 the iphone what really made it special was touch and what that did is allow the phone not just to be a phone but to become a computer in your pocket and really opened up this whole concept of the whole app ecosystem and really doing so much more than just making a phone call or sending a text message or taking pictures like you could do with a flip phone and i think ai has that same power to really fundamentally change the types of things that we do on our phone much more advanced things that didn't get into today but allowing third parties to tie into apps to do more advanced things for us uh reconcile a utility bill to go and book different events organize different calendars between multiple people there's so much you can do i think it fundamentally will change how we think about that computer in your pocket and so i do not believe that apple shares are going to go up 4,000% in the next 15 years as they did over the last 15 but i do believe this is the most significant announcement since the iphone and i'll leave it there on behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now"
Pressure Points: Tesla 1Q'24 Preview,2024-04-19 19:39:12+00:00,9,wSL3DZ5g6b4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSL3DZ5g6b4,[music] welcome to pressure points i'm jean monster from deep waterer asset management our topic tonight is amazon earnings and no surprises here on the pressure point which is aws and before we jump into results i want to take a step back and frame in why aws is so important to amazon stock it's just under 20% of total revenue but it's more than all of their operating income and it's growing faster than the rest of the business and that means that investors see this as an increasingly important part of the business and that's been the aws importance for the last few years but over the last year it's become increasingly important because of ai and specifically is the ai opportunity over the next couple years should one of the first areas that it's going to land is related to increase spending in cloud as companies move these models into the cloud train them and get inferences from them the hypers scales that being aws with about a third of the market share microsoft azure with 20% and google cloud with about 10% are positioned to grow well and the setup going into earnings tonight was there was a bracing aws growth has been slowing and specifically going from uh about mid 20% a year and a half ago to uh expectations of 12% growth in the september quarter compare that to azure and google cloud which are growing kind of in the mid 20% so aws has been losing share what investors were looking for going into tonight is to see that share loss um not be as extreme as what it's been more recently and drum roll for the results is aws in fact missed the street expectations for september growing at 12% the expectation was for 133% growth but again that outlines how they've been losing share shares of amazon based on that were basically down 1% on that news until the earnings call when jesse ceo jesse talked about that the deal pace within aws has quickened more recently and specifically is that in the month of september they signed a handful of deals that in aggregate more than equaled all of the new bookings that they had in the first two months of the quarter and as you quickly play that forward to the december quarter because they did not recognize that revenue importantly that revenue was not recognized in september it will be recognized in december that probably means that the street is going to have to upwardly revise their aws growth estimates for december it was at 14% maybe it goes to 15 or 16% so as you think this through it's 12% growth in september to call it 15 16% growth in december that's moving in the right direction it's still losing share to azure and google cloud but moving more in the right direction than what initially looked like when the numbers came out and not surprising once that happened shares rebounding and as of this recording they're now up 5% so we saw a 6% move in shares based on that the a reason why jesse is talking about the success that they're having very recently with aws relative to ai is he said that because they have such large market share all the data or a lot of data is on aws and what he's seen is companies are moving their ai models to aws and then they train them there which makes sense you don't want to go and pull out all of your data and move it somewhere else and that seems to be having a benefit to the company more recently so the pressure point looked like it was in a bad spot after hearing a little bit more commentary it looks like it's in a better spot but still losing share and the expectations for in investors through 2025 is that it's still going to be losing share analysts currently have 18% growth for aws in calendar 25 and azure and google cloud will probably be going in the mid 20% in that year and so um i'm moving in the right direction but still they have to solve the growth challenge related to aws and so uh it is a separate piece to this important pressure point is i think the reaction to amazon stock is evidence that the year of efficiencies and margin improvement is largely a thing of the past for investors and they're all focused on growth the great upside we saw in amazon's earnings the raised margin expectations for december that doesn't matter when it compares to uh commentary regarding aws so that is the tail that wags the dog and that is a wrap for this episode of pressure points on behalf of deep water i'm jean bye for now
Pressure Points: Tesla 1Q'24 Earnings,2024-04-24 01:02:33+00:00,13,SjG62Pqd6zA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjG62Pqd6zA,welcome to deep tech 315 i'm jean mster along with doug clinton our three topics today are open ai dev day second elon musk's x a.x company and their grock model and last we're going to talk about humane in an ai device a ai pin device and so we'll take it back to the top the beginning of the week i'm still reverberating from this 45 minute uh preo that sam mman did at open ai dev day and uh i was uh just mesmerized by it uh as you're watching doug what were you thinking felt a little bit like an apple presentation i think intentionally i mean apple it's it's funny i guess to say but like they've set the standard for what a tech sort of demo day should look like and i think open ai is kind of carrying that mantle forward in terms of being super innovative i mean i think they're the most exciting company right now in tech and it's probably obvious to say it uh but the demo day really pro that with gpt um with the store that's coming i think that there's a lot to be excited in ai so yeah from the gpt piece so the two big announcements outside of just how exciting what they're doing around generative ai and just seeing the products in motion that that outside of that piece the two big announcements were gpt builder which is going to make it easier for i'll say non-technical people you're probably still kind of developer is don't you think to put these together and just i can try to give an explanation of it is you would go into their platform this is gpt builder if you want to train it the example that he gave was to give founders advice on a startup and so he just went in selected a a i think like a ted talk or something like that that he did and use train the model off of that and then turned it on in a way they went and so it was pretty powerful it looked pretty easy to do um do you think it's as easy as it looks i think it'll be pretty easy i mean the way i think about it is you have you know gpt for turbo i mean that's the most current model as of demo day uh that is your general intelligence right now now i'm not saying it's agi not artificial general intelligence but it has this general understanding kind of of the world that is your starting point and then i kind of see the purpose of pt builder as a tool to basically let people go and take that general intelligence and specialize it for something that they think would be really interesting so you gave the example of sam alman kind of teaching it up on some of his prior talks about startup you know business how to how to create velocity in startups how to run a startup that's a perfect example of a specialized you know gpt that we see out there i think you could see thousands hundreds of thousands millions of these gpts over time that are trained with very specific use cases and have these sort of narrow applications very specific use applications that people will monetize but for for me as i'm watching the demo i'm thinking is this as easy as it looks and you said you think it is but is that the right uh perspective do i get the right perspective here if it i think it will be i mean i've i've spent a lot of time using chat gbt claude bard um i've experimented with all of them and and i've created a lot of the these uh stock index products active strategies using just ai built on performance is pretty good by the way for many of them it is yeah and and um that has been relatively easy so the way i think about it is you need to go in you need to have some knowledge about how to create an effective prompt for ai so there is some learning curve it's i think it's a pretty thing a pretty easy thing to kind of get high on really quick so i don't think that's going to be a big barrier for people people who really want to do it who really want to learn will be able to go and it's nothing like trying to learn the code it's a way easier learning code curve than that yeah i was just thinking like this what all this great stuff we've heard around customer support and some of the improvements that we've had about adding these genera of experiences like that's still been more technical in nature and developers and bigger companies have been doing that now i feel like the doors are kind of opening up for a much bigger audience that can roll out these models and so that leads to their second announcement which was the store and they kind of think about this as like an app store for um for generative ai and as a reminder apps are not just on your phone apps are on computer apps are kind of everywhere you can have an app on a you can have an app on tv and so uh that really i had to kind of have a flashback back to when apple announced its app store in in 2008 like it really changed the v the phone from being a a device an internet device and a phone to a computer in your pocket that was a huge unlock and so in the back of my mind i'm thinking is this as big of an unlock as the app store was for apple it it opens up the technology to the wider creativity of humanity i mean that's fundamentally what the app store did was it took all the great ideas that apple had and it said okay let's let's take this technology and put it in the hands of developers and see what they make and now we have millions of apps and things like uber came out of that things like airbnb i mean you could argue some of these platforms maybe wouldn't even exist for sure didn't have an app store and and i think you're going to see the same exact thing here you know with an even wider potential set of people that are creating these applications and so if you rewind back to 2008 say man like the app store was so obvious i wish i knew how to code and create apps back then now you're going to have another chance to sort of do the same thing just got to figure out how to prompt these ai as well yeah and i also was thinking in the back of my mind like what does apple think of this ultimately and got me thinking about apple or open ai eventually doing a phone and uh then we were talking about this after too like and you know you're like don't just stop at the phone uh kind of remind me remind us where uh you were going with this well yeah i think it's it's uh everything i mean ai could touch anything that has uh a connection right now which our door locks have connections our toasters have connections our ovens have internet connections so anything that's connected right now you could reimagine in a new way with ai which we're going to talk a little bit about the humane pin a little later but um i don't think it's just about a phone i mean the phone is the thing we kind of live and experience a lot of the connected world through but the idea of an ai interface instead of a touchscreen interface is something that i think we could see kind of pervade throughout connected devices uh not just phones uh we're kind of in our research meeting we were kicking around the idea of what would happen if you're having all this economic value essentially that's getting pulled into open ai store and they're going to divide that for example build something where a customer service person would uh be distributed through an app and then some of that value is going to be kept by open a and some's going to be distributed back to um to the developer to the company and i was i was just thinking what if apple could pull that back that same stuff and this is going to be for another week but apple is just they got to be moving on this behind the scenes because if they don't they're missing a huge opportunity so in the interest of time we're going to shift to the second uh big topic which was related to elon's company and grock uh their their new model i'm going to give a quick setup of what where that name comes from doug and you can just kind of give everybody a one-onone on what the product is uh the name uh is inspired by a book a stranger in a strange land which was written like 1960 one of the characters in the book uh came from mars half martian half human but the uh one of the words in his language was uh gro that kind of with sted the test of time as he came to earth and that word happened to be uh meaning like a uh a a great meaning and so would uh if you want to give some context into what uh what's the product actually like what are they doing here with grock grock is x. ais's foundational model and what's different i would say about it versus you know an open ai or a bard is it is incorporating some of the data from twitter x now uh to train the model and i think that's really important because if you think about you know what's happening on the internet and really like real time nature twitter is that platform and so there may be some advantage you could argue for grock that they have more realtime understanding of like what is happening right now in the world than maybe any other ai platform out there um that's the advantage i think that they should push now i think there's probably some other question of you know what other uh of these models are pulling in twitter data how are they accessing it i know that that's been an issue all year uh facebook meta talked a little bit about threads i think and uh some of their data being pulled into these models and i more sense of before we get into the the data point and the advantage that um x twitter has there it it feels like it's they're positioning this is interaction with uh like a a disrespectful chatbot and it's supposed to be funny but i i'm still struggling with their starting point should i just ignore their starting point and think yes it's starting with this chat bot that happens to say crazy things and just look at the bigger picture yeah i think the starting point is it's it's a little bit of like elon's persona imbued in a chat bot you know elon's a little bit devilish and it's a little bit more cheeky and more fun you could argue than open ai which is more specific but is is this is this like a trojan horse where you start just kind of interacting it but ultimately is there a much bigger opportunity or is is elon just trying to entertain people with this i think there's a bigger opportunity i think he's trying to create something that's different if you go and you chat with bard claude and open ai you're g to have a fairly similar experience um you're going to have an experience where it feels like you're talking to a stayed you know normal personality l human i mean that's basically how these things are programmed they're not programmed to have a bunch of personality you can give them a personality through prompting and have fun with it that way but at a base level going back to kind of the beginning of the conversation kind of that general intelligence is just meant to answer your questions and deliver on your prompts i think the idea was the idea that elon wants us to start to inter interact with grock because it's fun it's different and then ultimately build in some more substance to it i mean are we going to be doing is there going to be like a microsoft co-pilot element to this where it's going to be probably not be crafting my emails but uh they i mean they want to kind of have that same vision because reading elon's book feels like he's going the isacon kind of framed it up that he's going right after open ai doesn't feel quite like that with grock i think that would be a misread i think that that the personality element of it is something that's meant to be fun i don't think elon i mean look at some of the other things he does with that this product isn't going anywhere but el to think it's not serious yeah it's a misread to think it's just this like toy i the personality is meant i think to uh again set aside grock from some of these other things and say like you can interact with a computer and it can still be fun right out of the box just like taking uh i think the sound on a tesla goes to 11 like no car manufacturer does that it's an inside joke that's what he does right uh let's end the topic of this question do you think elon wants to eat open ai's lunch i think that elon is so ambitious he wants to eat everybody's lunch and everything he does so yeah i'm sure he wants to compete with them love it checking the clock we've got two minutes here humane this is this pin xa apple people put together you wear it it's an ai pin it's going to go on sale uh for what was it 650 bucks $6.99 $6.99 and then you got to pay like 25 bucks a month for you can do like phone calls and things for it it's got this kind of clever hologram even though there's not a screen on it you can use your hand and it will kind of superimpose some of the controls on there reminds me of the shuffle when it came out i thought apple would never do a screenless ipod and in fact they did but it didn't last very long and it feels like this is kind of fun that we're experimenting with this but uh my my sense is that it has a place but doesn't really capture it's not going to replace the phone don't think it will i think it's a um it will be a fun thing to see in terms of how people try to fit ai into a device and make it ai first and not screen first because we've never seen that before we've never really seen that uh and so i think what we could see is the pin could inspire some other companies maybe like apple more likely maybe even like open ai to think they could make devices johnny iv and that whole rumor piece to it which by i understand sam alman's an investor in humane too which kind of the plot thickens around that we're we're quickly running out of time here too but um does uh how does it work since it's voice driven there's some gesture based but does it work when you're in public or in a group of people it feels like that's kind of a pretty big headwind to this product i think it's the same headwind is if you were trying to use siri in in a group of people or in public i think it's basically the same so we'll see is the answer ultimately technology has to be as good as apples but yeah they call siri out in public all the time so sure uh like you said we'll see we'll be getting one be fun it'll be one of our topics for another deep tech on behalf of doug jean and deep tech 3 15 that's a wrap bye for now
Pressure Points: Meta 1Q'24 Earnings,2024-04-24 22:30:14+00:00,7,Muo-p7Mc6HA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muo-p7Mc6HA,[music] welcome to the first episode of frontier and center i'm jean mster from deepwater asset management and this is a weekly podcast discussing frontier tech for those of you who are new to the concept of frontier tech a brief definition frontier tech is investing in where the world is going over the next five years these are emerging tech themes typically three to five themes within broader frontier tech and what is special is that these themes can change over time it is not wed to a single theme like crypto the metaverse robotics it has opportunity to reweight to where the bigger opportunities are for example over the past year ai has become a bigger part of frontier tech and so that's what frontier tech is and as we discuss it one thing we want to do is measure it and the best way to measure it is to use the deepwater frontier tech etf it's powered by innovator the ticker is l we're going to use that as the way to measure how these companies are doing and really track the performance of how investors are thinking about these emerging trends and so each week we're going to start with a performance piece and then separately talk about one of the companies within the index so starting with performance year to date off to a tough start down 3% this is l down 3% that compares to the nasdaq which is up a half a percent the reason why it's been under pressure is interest rates have inched higher based on higher cpi numbers and that has a greater negative impact on emerging companies just because the way the discount rate works and so an inch up in interest rates has a more negative impact on on how these smaller companies sub 50 billion in market cap typically are performing as far as since inception which was 20 18 uh it lup is up 69% just to give you some broader context there so that's the performance piece let's shift to the company and our first company we're going to highlight is new bank and new bank is based in brazil headquartered in brazil and they're a fintech company and this is riding the wave of just expansion of fintech within latin america and also just a growing global importance of latin america within the global economy as some center of gravity is shifting from asia to latin america and the company was founded in 2013 has a $44 billion market cap in 2020 2021 it had hyper growth was growing at 200% plus and that was a period where its market share has just grown immensely gone from less than 1% in 2019 to 8% in the region and uh through that period per the numbers have been getting harder the law of large numbers and so the growth rates have moderated a little bit now it's down to 50% growth in 2023 and will likely grow revenue at 35% in 2024 earnings should grow faster more like 45% this year and when you put all of this together look at that revenue and earnings growth relative to the valuation we believe it's attractive it's trading at 22 times and growing earnings at 45% there's a discount there because this is latin america investors obviously in the us generally don't like paying up as much for assets outside of the country and so you see a little bit of that but we think that gap is probably not justified and so that's just the highest level as far as what's the substance of what's driving this incredible market share gain over the past four or five years is that they're taking a digital first approach to banking this is the first company that's really done that well and in latin america that's particularly important because number one is that there's an intimidation factor around banking for the underbanked population and think of in more broadly in latin america the underbanked population is about a third of the population now compare that to the us where the underbanked is more like 5% and so you have this larger base of people that just have never been exposed to financial products and in the case of going digital it just makes it more accessible even the things as basic as setting up account to be able to do that online line versus go through the hassle and some of the uh what is viewed as intimidation around setting up a bank account and going into a local branch not having to do that is a powerful advantage that new bank has taken advantage of and separately they start with banking but they also extend credit and credit cards is they have the ability to use more technology more ai in terms of identifying which of those people are most appropriate for credit and they've done a great job of making those identifications and giving people credit for the first time it's crazy to look at the numbers still like in mexico for example still almost 90% of transactions are still done in cash so still largely cash culture here as far as geographically where this company is doing the best it's brazil about 95% of their customers are in brazil that accounts to about 85 million customers in brazil about one and two of the bankable population in the country there's just over 180 million bankable people in brazil about 220 million people in total so that's their center of gravity that's been the focus that's what's really working for them and they're starting the process of expanding into mexico and colombia and in those two countries new bank now has just over 5 million customers so it's still really small within that but those two countries specifically have probably the biggest growth opportunity one because they're coming off of a smaller base but two because that underbank population is greater in those two countries and so that is an opportunity and as far as specifically how they're going to continue to drive growth it's pretty simple is it start with a digital first approach get uh basic products of banking and credit in the hands and then start to expand products including investments insurance payroll in 2023 the company added 40 different products some of the 20 in the in different countries and but 40 in total across their platform form in terms of new offerings and so that idea of being first digital land and expand is the opportunity and last is one of the most important pieces one of the beautiful things that we do at deepart is we invest in both early stage all the way to some of the biggest companies and one thing that's true all along is just always it's about the founders about the leading the leadership and the founding team in this case you get it both you get a founder leader which i always love to see david 's he's next level done a great job and uh as part of my excitement and confidence in the story is related to him and his vision his ability to make good on executing on that vision so that's new bank that's our first episode of frontier and center i'm jean and see you next week
Pressure Points: Google 1Q'24 Earnings,2024-04-25 23:12:12+00:00,7,KzeB6H3lXP0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzeB6H3lXP0,"welcome to this week's episode of deep tech 315 that's doug i'm jean we had a fun episode we're going to talk about nvidia earnings and more importantly the outlook second what's happening in the ev space rivan lucid down big this week and last we're going to talk about elon's opportunity with x. and how it fits into the pantheon of foundation models and so we'll take it to the top all attention this week clearly on nvidia in case you didn't see it uh they exceeded estimates by a little bit they raised uh guidance by about 9% for the april quarter the current quarter we're in and by last count my last count is analysts overall have taken their numbers up by about 20% their earnings numbers up for calendar 24 up about 20% the stocks up about 15% as the time of this recording so actually nvidia's multiple on the next 12 months out has actually declined slightly today it trading it's trading right about 20 eight times uh those expectations and so i'm g to pause there that was kind of the the how the quarter was but more importantly what did you take out of the call that it feels kind of like ai is this unstoppable freight train at least the infrastructure spend on it so far i mean nvidia now has had i think a string of almost four quarters uh going back to to calendar q2 last year when they really had this huge inflection um and you know the the hyperscalers are investing we're hearing more about sovereign nations potentially you know building their own models they'll need to invest um and so even though it feels like the stock has been on fire the chart is up and to the right um it's been supported to your point by the numbers you know this hasn't been really a story of multiple expansion it's been a story of business expansion and i think the question that investors just have to ask now is can this momentum continue because i think everybody sort of knows and anybody who's followed semi sort of knows like this historically has been a very cyclical industry and eventually you get to a point where you know demand uh slows down infrastructure is built out and uh these stocks then go in the other direction in the in the counter cyle will move um definely i want to highlight that scar tissue piece to it a lot of scar tissue in the stock if you look at that call it 50 analysts that cover it they're all over the board in terms of how they see this playing out and typically the ones that have been covering it longer have this belief that there's going to be some blow up it's surprising to go back and look at in their this in their january of 23 quarter so a year ago their business was down 20% year-over a year in the april quarter it was down like 14% year-over year and then as you said kind of in the back half of the year it really started to accelera 100 250% kind of growth it will grow around 230% in this current april quarter and so you're exactly right that's this kind of boom and bust um scar tissue that is is i think plaguing some of the or impacting the multiple impacting the view that people have and i come back to like is this is ai g to have that same boom and bust or is this at least for the next few years such a big paradigm shift that it will power through what has been a history of boom and bust it feels like that's becoming the more likely scenario right that the investment level this investment cycle continues for instead of it being whatever 18 months maybe is is what optimist thought it was when this started maybe it is more like three years you know maybe it is more like four years and we've got a pretty long investment pathway here obviously nvidia they have new chips coming out h200 um that'll be their newest chip and i think you're going to see some upgrade from that they talked about continuing to have demand that exceeds supply on the call and so i think the reality is this ai cycle probably just extends much longer than maybe even the optimist thought before the call jensen wong's final comment this closing comment i always remember just stick on just stay on that the conference call listen to what he has to say he basically built the case that the compute market is going to be several hundred billion dollars he said in the next five years and you can kind of go through some loose math and and conclude that they can grow their business at greater than 15% in calendar 26 27 and 28 and i think i would consider that a win he does highlight uh you talked about the hyperscaler piece phase two is enterprise which would be like co-pilot service now salesforce part three is heavy industry with generative ai and then the sovereign piece that you you talked about so if he's right uh we're going to have more than 18 months agree with you this could go on from for the next three years and ultimately grow at 15% plus you know i'll just throw one last thing that does triangulate with what amd's been saying too 400 billion by 2027 so we're starting to get a couple of those couple hundred billion dollar numbers out there makes sense second topic is the ev space those who've been following doug and i this has been a fun debate fun topic and this one in particular is a fun one because rivan here uh based at the time recording is down about 25% they lowered their delivery expectations for calendar 24 from roughly the street was roughly at 85,000 uh units uh the street knew that ev demand was slowing analysts knew that when they put the 85,000 number out there and they had guided to mid-50s or high high 50s so call it a 35% guide down stock down 25% i remember when i saw the numbers dug i remembered a debate that we had about nine months ago stock was was $17 i really wanted to have one of our funds investing in rivan big believer in electrification i still am uh and you came back and said look at i actually think that they're not going to grow as fast that ev demand is going to slow and ultimately been spot on and i think that this if we look at what's going on with rivan and separately lucid reported they also had some difficult numbers low their delivery numbers caught from 15,000 to 7,000 much smaller uh but their stocks down 15% if you look at some of the commentary from uh rivan's ceo on uh on squawkbox this morning he talked about this the high interest environment is having a negative impact on evs that's the same thing that elon said and i i buy that i think that high interest rates do make a headwind here for evs but is there something more structural going on in terms of how people are thinking about switching to evs i think people are just getting to the point where they say is it really that much better than gas i think it's that simple you know if gas prices aren't astronomical and they like the design and i keep coming back to this too a brand matters design matters function matters if they like the design and the ability to just go and fill up their car in three minutes and get back on the road i think that is still a useful value prop i think is probably for depends on where you live if you live in the cold it might not be the better option uh like minnesota it's tougher um but i think for a lot of people electric probably is a better overall option for a car but like i've been saying it's just it's going to take way longer than people think to get that adoption curve uh to to shift dramatically in favor of electric and on top of that you look at riv i mean these are premium price vehicles these are very expensive electric vehicles they're not entry-level vehicles and so i think you might be seeing in the context of them maybe some even more saturation at the high end of the market where there are more options 75,000 plus the r2 of course expected to be out later this year expected asp 45 to 55,000 uh that should change the equation there's a question are they going to have enough capital to get r2 up to capacity because they got to build out this georgia facility to do that and um that mean that's that's all accurate i think that the it's pretty compelling to be able to fill up your car in 3 minutes that's uh quite a fast charging network actually say that sometimes and i feel like we have two gas cars our next cars are going to be electric but the i'll say i'm going to charge the car trying to get myself in that that habit but i'm still a believer in the benefits of electrification uh just because i think cars right now are a a great place relative to the performance i think they do have better performance than a gas car it's not about uh great performance but just ease of use you talk about going to the pump i actually don't like going to the gas pump and if um you're in a lucky category which i'm i'm fortunate enough to be in where our home can have a charger at home i think i would prefer that so i'm still on board with this i think that tesla's going to right siize things when their new productions going to come out i'm still optimistic on that but i i think it's uh fun to report back you were negative on this you were right i'm glad that uh the fund and myself heated that that direction and we'll see how this plays out going forward one one other quick thing to add too when we think about rivian why the reaction i actually don't think it is because they missed the supposed guidance i doubt that any buyid investors thought they were going to do 85 i think the problem is if you look at the numbers i believe that they basically guided for flat production year-over-year when you're supposed to be you know a great growth company and you're investing a lot of money you're not generating earnings or cash flow you can't have flat year-over-year numbers it just doesn't work forget about consumer demand for a minute that just doesn't work as question he got asked it by phil this morning and he basically said we got to evaluate our options when it comes to raising money i think as a growth company and i hear about needing to raise money that's that's a big red flag yeah especially when you're not growing that's the hard part it's g to be the hardest part makes sense uh thankfully tesla doesn't need to raise cash we'll jump to our final topic which is related to ai something uh happened this week related to google so they have a multimodal gemini gemini ultra it's multimodal which means you can put in uh you can ask it to do different things whether it's through images you can has an image generator within it but effectively there was a kind of a swirl this week around asking it to produce images of people and there were certain colors of people that were not represented that didn't make a ton of sense that essentially that the the ai was not representing what what happened in history and so it kind of created this stir around is google too biased and uh when i first saw the story i actually didn't believe it and uh we went back and dug you played around with it i don't know if you had that language out there but basically confirm that this did happen that that uh the gemini was showing some kind of false images and how it generated images since then they've paused it correct doug they have we tried to use it earlier and the current prompt or sorry the current response you get if you give gemini a uh image prompt is we are working to improve gemini's ability to generate images of people we expect this feature to return soon and will notify you in release updates when it does and when i saw this i just thought uh this is score one for elon and x. because he's really trying to build a model that's truth seeking he is is and i think um he gets criticism for xia he gets criticism for twitter because i think he also is trying to make twitter a place for truth um and some people don't uh don't want the truth i think and that has nothing to do with politics of left or right i think everybody wants their side to win everybody thinks their side is correct um but some things are just factual especially things that relate to history and when you see um kind of regious changes uh in how history is presented i think it does invite these orwellian sort of questions and comparisons where if ai is going to be this really powerful technology that shapes how humans think and how we interact with uh information broadly that information should be based on truth and i think um that the second thought i had other than you know this seems ridiculous was the first thought when i saw this google issue the second thought i had was exactly what you said which is for all the uh i think heat that elon seems to get sometimes from a political perspective what he's building is actually truly valuable not just in an economic sense but in a societal context like you have to have some truth seeking uh oracle right you have to have something that adheres to fundamental reality you can't just go and rewrite things because you know it seems like the nice thing to do and i think that's what xai stands for and that's what elon stands we're believers that this is going to rival tesla and spacex x. in terms of generating wealth for him uh right now his net worth based on bloomberg is estimated to be $210 billion doar but these models could be foundation modeles top three foundation models could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars and i think that that uh probability is on the table informed by a lot of the real time intention that data that he can get from twitter angling that into to x. and just want to i say one final topic here our goal again like you said doug is we don't want to be political on it we just want to recognize that there is this battle going on with ai and relative to how people think about the future and the past and we just want to highlight that there are different companies going in different directions to try to solve that so staying out of the political conversation just the facts with deep tech 315 on behalf of doug i'm jean see you next week"
DeepTech315: Earnings: Tesla / Meta / Google & Microsoft,2024-04-26 14:29:47+00:00,15,kM70BJfpjCE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM70BJfpjCE,welcome to deep tech 315 that's doug i am jean our three topics this week are tik tock changes to apple's european app store and lastly grock x. sounds like they're kicking off with open source approach and so we'll take it to the top this has been grabbing most of the headlines in tech this week is related to tik tok something happened that i would put in the category of unprecedented in the house the vote it was 84% in favor of banning tik tock if they don't sell it so they got to sell it this of course goes to the senate it'll probably take two to four months to be presented to the senate and then eventually it gets on to if it does get through it's considered a 5050 whether it gets through the senate it gets to biden but we didn't want to focus on the mechanics of the political side of this and will it get pass or will it not past but just from a first put some perspective on tik tok's us business and then doug i love you to just to talk about the platform more broadly in terms of the mechanics of its maybe relationship with china in the past we've talked about the importance of tech has played in terms of influencing public opinion when the ukraine war started we talked about just uh tech this kind of an important weapon in propaganda and that is new part of new modern warfare and so just wanted to uh get some context to how tik tok plays in this whole equation but just in terms of the us business they have 170 million users tik tok does they spend on average about 80 minutes a day that compares to in uh they have 170 million users tik tok does that compares to instagram with 180 million average tik tock tik tok user spends as they mentioned 80 minutes a day average instagram spends about 40 minutes a day and that includes real that gets put into that instagram bucket it's rumored that the revenue for tik tock in the us is somewhere between 10 and 15 um billion dollars per year which if you apply a meta revenue multiple on that it puts the valuation somewhere around 100 billion and you know these talks about these other investor groups potentially getting together are corporate groups and so uh just wanted to give context that that's the size of the business the us business tik tock is about roughly 20% of the size of meta's us business so that's just all context a lot of usage 65% more minutes watched on day on tik tok versus what is watched on instagram and that's why of course this grabs a lot of headlines especially related to meta which is one of our investments in our core titan fund and so doug um maybe you could talk i know we've had conversations about just the mechanics of tik tok beyond all all the headlines today uh what should we know about how this all works well i think what's that issue and why the uh government has sort of been concerned about tik tok for several years now and now they're finally taking action on it is that there's been a pattern of evidence that uh you know whether it's tracking users that may have the app on their phone in certain ways whether it's perhaps manipulating which hashtags might be trending in the us um or even the types of content that we see in the us versus in china i think there's been a pretty uh growing pattern of evidence that the uh things we see in the us are different than in china and it it seems like there may be some i don't know if you want to call it espeon that might be too strong of a word um or scop is a is a word people love to use online um but certainly there's there's enough evidence to warrant concern that uh there's more going on than just an algorithm deciding that the wants to see different content than china so rewind a year ago to those memorable times when tik tock ceo went to capitol hill and there was i would say unanimous uh angst against tik tock from those lawmakers and they talked about project texas working with oracle to seal off the servers and so would your what's your view on that so tik tok's response would be uh what you just described isn't happening because we've sealed everything off in the us through texas again actions speak louder than words i think that there continues to be evidence that some of the same behavior is happening and so uh even if you seal the servers off uh that doesn't eliminate the human angle um and even having the servers quote unquote sealed i don't know that that guarantees that um other actors still might not find ways to get access to the system okay makes it of sense i think that the kind of the news flow of this is largely going to cool down over the next few months probably we'll get talk of different groups that are trying to build some momentum to purchase if in fact it does legislation goes through but i think in general this will kind of cool down i gotta ask the question doug what when you think about the three outcomes here uh you know this is one of my favorite things to do i think it's probably your your less favorite things to do but put odds on uh things happening but we got three outcomes uh one is nothing changes the second is a ban and the third is a sale i've got my numbers locked in i say most favorable odds most likely outcome is a sale of the three okay i got a sale at 25% 50% chance that nothing happens which leav 25% on a ban stay tuned few months we'll be back at this topic next topic is related to apple some additional changes to their app store in europe uh europe has been a paino for apple when it comes to navigating some regulation they've had these kind of flare ups really across the globe on their app store related to developers and some of their frustration of course apple has had this 30% take rate for the bigger developers 15% for the smaller and that is getting unbundled and uh app this week announced what i think was the biggest change was in europe the ability for larger developers with a million downloads or more basically a million users or more can now uh d directly allow the user to download from their website i thought that's a a nice feature for consumers and gives developers the advantage that they can skate around some of the fees related to the app store with the direct downloads also gives them just more pricing flexibility to to change prices and kind of do what they want to do and so uh apple uh is not doing this out of their goodness of their heart they're doing this because they're continuing to have a dialogue with the eu regulation body and that is prompting these changes but of course apple doesn't want to just make the changes and kind of leave it as is they are essentially trying to find ways of of working around and i'll give you some kind of broad broader perspective is that probably 98% of app developers are going to pay less in europe because of this and the european business they haven't broken it out but cfo luca mro on their last earnings call said that it's 7% of the global app store revenue comes from europe and that basically equates to half a percent of apple's total revenue comes from europe and uh comes from the european app store and so this is a small piece but it's important because it's half a percent of revenue but it's probably a percent of profits and of course what happens in europe could end up becoming what is precedent in the us and so uh this is why we care about this the abor is a great business it's a highly profitable business for apple and apple wants to maintain that and my general sense is that they're playing this pretty smart they're recognizing that they got to make changes but then they come out with these other fees that they're charging developers in this case if you're a developer with a million or more downloads you're going to charge uh zero a half of a euro per download which includes any updates on an annual basis and so what that means if you have three million downloads you're going to get charged you're have to pay apple a million dollars a year and it means that about 2% of these developers are going to actually pay apple more under this scenario and so when i put all this together my guess is apple's looking at this in a very uh they're just they know the levers that are getting pulled here and they're probably going to get the app store to be more or less where it is in terms of revenue and earnings contribution after these changes and so love your take doug is this something where uh you see is this kind of the decline of the app store or are you more in my camp where uh that these changes are the fact that they're able to charge different ways are able to kind of navigate what's essentially an economic head in i think it's still the middle of the battle i i think we're already seeing and i i believe i saw that epic um filed a lawsuit suggesting that apple was sort of uh ignoring the court's orders uh in in something related to their case i didn't go deeper on that but i think the bottom line is when you talk about the 2% of developers that might pay more um those 2% of developers i would be willing to bet are some of the largest developers in the world and some of the developers that generate the most money on the app store and for the app store so they are you saying more they have a more ability to kind of work around the app store then no you you said 2% are going to be paying more into the new regime correct those are the biggest ones yep and so if they're going to be paying more under the new regime i think they are figuring out ways to say look we can we can cut a break to a lot of these small developers who don't really pay us much but we can get that back maybe by exerting more pressure on some of these bigger developers who are the ones who are fighting it the most and i think this is only going to make them fight harder so it feels again to me like this is still the middle of this story i don't think this is the end of all the questions around the app store and fairness in in charging that i know we've talked about a ton the courts are obviously looking at um i would be shocked if in a few months we're not talking about a new policy uh because they needed to adjust something whether that's related to new regulation or developer feed or whatever it might be mh well we've already had yeah one change to your point we've already had one change in a matter of basically a month in europe up and my attention is what happens in the us and that's uh i think a bigger um economic challenge in terms of the app store we're going to jump to the final test here final uh chapter which is elon this week said that o uh x. gro is going to be open source just as a quick reminder there are two basic foundation modes we'll call them on one side is close source that would be obviously open ai with g gpt google with gemini anthropic um and cloud and anthropic and then you have on the uh that's basically you pay for those models you get more support for them uh the models uh don't give you as much insight in terms of attribution and it's a little bit hard to customize them but those are where all the kind of excitement and economic activity is and on the open source side we of course have llama 2 meta said llama 3 is going to come out this july and that is um a free application easier to make tweaks to it and usually used by people with more sensitive information or smaller developers and so we've been waiting a lot to hear what's xai going to do uh they're sounds like they're going to jump in as an open source and uh what was your reaction to that not really surprising in two specific contexts like obviously we have this lawsuit between musk and open ai u and him sort of pushing the idea that open ai maybe is ignoring or has somehow uh defaulted on its original premise right open ai the point of it was that it wanted to make open technology to the world and obviously i think musk is arguing at least they saw this ability to try to maximize profit and they sort of went down that road uh even though there's a lot of nuances to the deal that they cut with microsoft on the second point i actually think this is sort of a pattern of behavior for musk and his companies you look at tesla they opened up all their patents several years ago on the ev front uh they've now basically partnered with everybody on charging in the ev world and i think that they've kind of had a pattern of being a pretty open company and finding ways to monetize their products by actually being open just because you make something open doesn't mean you can't monetize it i think that's a fallacy when when people hear open source was and closed source you can still offer managed services right i mean meta for example they have partnerships and they don't make a ton of revenue from this today but they have partnerships with uh azure for example where if somebody goes and has a hosted llama uh instance on azure meta gets a little bit of revenue from that um maybe over the long run meta starts to offer it manage service for llama maybe xai decides they want to do the same thing with its grock chatbot so i think there's still a lot of ways that they might find to uh to make money off of this but i think spiritually this is just what kind of elon does with his companies and i think he sort of had to do it given the lawsuit with open ai to make a statement makes a ton of sense uh this again is probably one of the hottest deals i think in the private space uh what's going on with x. all eyes are on when and if if and when elon is going to raise money for this they're doing something pretty unique here with this truth seeking ai and we're going to leave it there on behalf of doug i'm jean bye for now
Pressure Points: Apple 2Q'24 Earnings Preview,2024-04-30 16:31:45+00:00,9,anDkflx-AJs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anDkflx-AJs,"[music] welcome to pressure points i'm jean mster our topic is tesla earnings before we get into the details i want to take a step back as of recording shares of tesla are down about 6% in after hours trading and i suspect that sher decline will continue tomorrow tesla's business is being impacted by the macro slowness and evs and i note that while other car makers are pulling back on their investments in the future tesla is increasing those investments and ultimately i believe that that will be the formula for tesla's value to increase down the road and so since this is an earnings uh period we're going to break down some of the other important topics and then jump into the pressure point and i've outlined five other key points and we'll start with the first which is related to profitability now typically the pressure point with tesla earnings is related to profitability this time it's more of a setup towards it of course the key metric here is autog gross margins x credits that came in at 17.2% in line with expectations it marked the first time in a year that that metric has improved but that positive factor was muted by some of the commentary from the cfo that they are reaching some of the limits in terms of how they can expand margins on their current u production of of platform and i read that as to expect that margins will probably decline in 20124 obviously the growth rate comes down but you have this concept of reaching some of the limits of the production margin expansions and also they're going to be investing in this new nextgen platform which will likely also have a negative impact on margins and something else that caught my eye is in their their investor deck they did remove mo their margin slide and so i think they don't want to draw too much attention to that so my thought is that margins are going to be under pressure for probably the next year year and a half and won't start showing some improvement to the back half of 2025 when that next line gets up and running which probably means we don't see margins back to 20% plus until 2026 it's a long road but that's the update on profitability second the cyber truck elon reiterated 250,000 plus units my sense is that's in 2026 most analysts and other people who follow tesla are thinking that's 2025 i think we're probably that's probably a year or two optimistic but in aggregate tesla the cyber truck is still relatively small relative to what will be this is called 10% of total vehicles our third topic is related to optimus this got more attention than i was expecting expecting on the call and maybe no surprise elon said this product could ship as early as next year uh i rolled my eyes when i heard that and said i'll take the over please as far as uh what is uh unique or what kind of dawned on me during the call is that they really uh like human life uh includes moving around in vehicles and then you move around to get out to do work and so i think the two optimal form factors for robotics is something related to a vehicle which would be fsd and then something related to an autonomous human which is a humanoid or optimus and so elon's on to something this is the most difficult technical task that tesla has taken on is to build this robot so we'll see where it plays out but kind of that teaser uh made me uh confident that they're continuing to invest in the right area of things that could unlock measurable shareholder value uh next is related to um autonomy more broadly so they give a metric every quarter related to total autonomous miles driven this would be on their fsd cars that are in the market and the the number they have a graph in their shareholder deck it looks like about 750 million miles driven that's up about 44% since september and then from uh june to september that number was up 78% and then from march to june that number was 100% so the growth has gone from 100 to 78 to 44 that's noteworthy to me because when things are ready to break out the technology is just getting used more and more and more and more quickly and so even though those are high growth rates they can sustain those high growth rates and i think what's going on is that the number of people that are trying fsd in their base isn't expanding at a rate that is encouraging at this point for whatever reason it's not encouraging and i think that there needs to be a course correction there and it makes me believe that we're not a year away from autonomy i still think it's closer to five years away uh so that's the update on autonomy and last a pretty boring topic which is taxes uh their tax rate is going to go up from about 10% to 25% this doesn't impact cash cash flow but it does impact some of the optics of what tesla's earnings look like and that could change how this scores for some investors so those are we'll call the other topics and we'll next we get to the pressure points the key point here is related to what is tesla's growth over the next two years and as a point of reference going into this year the expectations were that revenue was going to grow 19% the same rate that it grew at in 2020 three and in their outlook session section they made a change usually that outlook section in terms of sales growth is unchanged about this 50% keger that some years it's higher some years it's lower this time they said because they're making a shift to a next generation platform next year that's going to have a measurable or a notable was the word they used impact on revenue growth this year and so my best guess is people are going to kind of end up at around 10% revenue growth in 2024 and the reason why revenue growth declines in there is because the more that they talk about this nextgen platform and that nextgen platform is probably a couple vehicles that are priced more like $30,000 so below where model 3 typically comes in which is around $40,000 more in line with what like a honda cord would cost and well below what the average new car costs in the us which is $48,000 but the more that it gets into the marketplace that tesla's building this lowcost vehicle the more the people who are thinking about buying a model 3 or a model y are going to say let's just see what that looks like let's just take a step back and see what that's going to look like it's worth waiting a year to save $10,000 and so that's going that's a decision that they've made is to be up front and to overc communicate that this platform change is coming maybe they have to just because of some of the infrastructure they need to build around it and eventually it's going to get out there but that's the decision that's been made and that has a negative impact in the near term and related to revenue the good news is that if they do come out with a $30,000 vehicle they said it could be as early as mid next year for production beginning we should start to see a bump up in revenue growth grow and i think this year again comes out around a 10% revenue growth and next year the back half of the year i think can be 30% so when you blend that with the first couple quarters at 10% and the back half at 30% maybe you end the year at like a 20% growth and then it bumps up to 30% in 2026 but that's kind of the trajectory and that's why this is the pressure point is what is ultimately the revenue growth going to look like and so when i boil it down i think we're going to go from call it 20% in 2023 to 10% in 24 20% in 25 and then higher in 26 so when you put all this together this was a sobering outlook for a company that has a massive opportunity in front of it but has a lot of work to do to capitalize on that opportunity i think they're making the right uh strategic decisions to do that and i think from an investor perspective patients will be rewarded ed longer term on behalf of pressure points i'm jean moner bye for now"
Pressure Points: Apple 2Q'24 Earnings,2024-05-03 13:23:56+00:00,9,HdmaCwoLnOg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdmaCwoLnOg,welcome to deep tech 315 our three topics today are preview of wwdc that's on june 10th se second we're going to talk about the relationship that open ai is having with some of these other big tech companies and what that ultimately means for everyone's future this being open aai microsoft apple open ai so we'll go back to the top we're at the doorstep in my opinion here call it 10 days away from wwdc and we're starting to get some of those contoured lines now and all these previews it's looking like uh a new siri not just a new siri but like a radical step function improvement in siri going from just a point question to a conversation uh separately adding more generative ai within kind of the core products like message for generating text messages or mail uh pages for the very few people who use pages uh to use that or keynote and then uh just more ai built into both the mac os and ios for uh being able to do basic things find files i think of this as essentially what we saw at uh a year plus ago from microsoft as they started to integrate co-pilot into windows we'll probably see a lot of those uh same similar features uh the one piece that uh we will probably not hear much about it's more reserved for like a september event but is an important part of the conversation is what does this mean for apple hardware and suspect that we'll see improvements with the chips they're ed the aeries of course with the iphones that's different than the m series that goes into the mac and just recently the most advanced m4 going into the ipad but they'll probably hold some of those the chip related silicon this device runs small language models really well conversation till september and so those there's a lot of other little things improvements in apps and better control of your home screen a lot of kind of shiny stuff around the edges but um i i uh wanted to pause there and just get your reaction doug if that ends up playing out as i just uh envisioned it what does it mean for apple i think the bar is really high for whatever apple does because we actually just had two pretty powerful ai demos with open right gpt 40 and then google with gemini and its advancements and so i feel like the bar is really high for apple and that's something that hasn't been talked about as much and in my opinion maybe enough and i'm i'm not sure if they can beat that bar because this is really their first forray in ai so i i think the better view to kind of go into this event is lower expectations they are going to obviously announce something in ai i think it will be a step forward but do i think it's going to be as good as some of the stuff we saw from open a and google over the last couple weeks i don't think it will be and so we just i think we need to be prepared that people might be disappointed if they want to see apple do something even more amazing than what's already out there i think there's the initial reaction to the event bar and then i think there's the bar about what longer term investors are thinking about and i think the bar for longer term investors is lower than what it is around the event because i think longer term investors are generally concerned about how apple is going to navigate an ai world there's this sense that this company is incredibly innovative and they will figure it out but in the back of mind present company included as an investor i i have this sense that that they're uh like we need to see something here and agree that what we saw in the last two weeks from the other big tech around their dev days has been was incredible but i i don't think that that is uh really the bar over the next month or two months i just think they need to show investors that they mean business that they're going to do something dramatic to inject ai into the business but the real shiny exciting part like ai agents doing work for you or giving developers tools for them to do that i don't think we're going to see that shiny stuff and i think that that's okay um so but makes sense bars high i still think that if they just show a good show force forward one unique approach to apple's ai strategy of course is this partnering piece which gets us to to our second topic here and that is related to are they going to do something with gemini or open ai just feels like all the momentum now is that they're gonna announce something with open ai and when i uh think about that that dynamic i come back to the relationship that microsoft has with open ai and with the idea if they do something can you just walk us through a deal gets announced with open ai and apple from uh not a financial perspective but from just like an integration perspective what's your best guess of how it all fits together uh in terms of what what do you mean fits together like the like they announced a deal with open ai that open ai is actually going to be powering the generative text within apple mail or is it open ai is uh going to be used for developers uh they're they have a uh like an api call or or some way that they uh try to direct developers to use open ai gp to power some apps that are being built like like what's kind of the spectrum of when we hear about apple and open ai what's the spectrum of the level of integration that we could see i think the base level of integration you should expect to see is that it ultimately powers generative products that are on apple devices that would be the first level right so it probably to some degree um could be built into future versions of siri and make siri more compelling obviously we know yeah with gp4 and the recent demo it's capable of of doing things they have to do that they have to show generative ai inside of siri if that doesn't happen uh it's going to be needle across a record and the funny thing is like they would almost apple would almost be better in my opinion of just scrapping siri entirely and using open ai to just be the voice layer uh given what we've just seen from them i don't think that's effectively what they'll be doing just keeping a siri brand around it but that's yeah it's possible might just be almost fully powered by open i think that' be smart i think that's kind of the first piece of it and obviously one thing on siri sorry about interrupting one thing on siri is that sometimes when we think about siri we think about our phones we think about like a homod but uh with the exception of airpods basically every apple device has siri built into it watch you can use siri uh apple tv has a siri it it really is this 2.2 billion devices so they've got great distribution when it comes to devices that can use it it just is you have a jaded user b that has kind of viewed this product as being uh unuseful but surprisingly because it is it is unuseful but i think people will give it a shot i think if apple came out and said uh it's much better i think people would at least give it a shot i think they' probably give a shot i think the leash would be pretty short though because of how much we've siri and being frustrating but to me that's ler one and then the wild card you mentioned sort of like you know what could happen with a developer focused product you know could it be something that is embedded perhaps in uh how apps get made and approved on the on the app store that to me feels like a wild card i doubt there would be something uh super aggressive out of the gate on that front but i wouldn't be surprised if we heard some kind of insinuations that maybe uh gpt is kind of the preferred uh ai layer for apps that ultimately get approved on the iphone and maybe that means those kinds of apps could have deeper integrations into apple's os yeah that's a it's a good point related to i didn't think about that this idea that when apps get approved there's uh kind of an underlying dna of the app that apple looks at and you know the model is another form of that that framework of a of a model so of an app that model is an important part of it um so uh that in in the context of kind of that app perspective what are develop is going to be listening for are they listening like i need tools to make my app to easily build ai into my app do you think that's what's on developers minds going into this not really because they already can like if you're an app developer today there's nothing preventing you from building features from open aai into your app now i mean you look at something like perplexity you can download perplexity on your iphone right now they use third party models with no problem um so i don't think there's some undying need of you know how can we get ai into our apps i think the bigger question is what is ai going to look like in apple's os how is it going to impact how people interact with these devices and then as an app developer how can i maybe build unique products and experiences for my users to uh to enjoy the you know apple ecosystem even more um before jump in the financial piece i just want to uh give context i think actually that the dev day uh apple's dev day is two weeks from now investors are generally going to view this as a positive move forward but one piece that will not be enumerated is in terms of how the financials work and so the base case that gets thrown out a lot of times is that google pays apple $15 billion doll a year for search placement therefore uh the open ai should pay apple something for the distribution the access those 2.2 billion uh users i know you got a little bit of a different take on using that analogy uh in terms of who might be paying whom yeah in this case well i think that the uh the idea that you know google obviously pays apple a lot to be the preferred provider of search on ios uh is different than what we're talking about here because every time somebody does a search google has a chance to monetize that and in effect what that deal does is allows apple to share in the money that google is making by being that preferred provider in the apple ecosystem in the case of whoever ultimately wins and it seems like it might be open ai for the ai preferred vendor open ai is not going to be making any money directly in any obvious way right now so over the long term could there be some sort of a developer relationship where you know like we just talked about they're the preferred provider maybe but out of the gate if open ai is just powering services and experiences in ios they're they're at just uh spending money to to provide those services to apple so i think it's hard to see how apple i mean maybe the deal is actually for minimal monetary compensation because there's benefits to both sides but i i i find it hard to believe out of the gate that you know one side or the other is going to be paying a ton here well there there's a piece to this with that kind of mirrors each other one side is that apple has this relationship with google that's very profitable as you add generative features uh does that make google feel different i guess they could really uh wall these off so you just can't do a general generative um you know on on you're not doing search like features by having open ai ai integrated into os i think it's there is kind of a wall there but i wonder how does that relationship with apple and google change when open aai comes in and similarly how does the relationship with microsoft and open ai change because if i'm microsoft i've invested 10 15 billion dollars into open ai i was there for you sam when things hit the wall last november and now you're going to do a deal with apple that doesn't feel right from microsoft's perspective i think i mean there's obviously news reports out about that right now and i i think they'll probably find a way to uh move past that would be my guess because at the end of the day if open aai becomes the preferred vendor for ai for apple that compute is going to be run on microsoft servers so so microsoft point from that deal um and i think that i think there's there's a little bit of like historical stasis too of like how much do microsoft and apple hate each other in my view they they play in almost very different games right now i mean microsoft has become very much a cloud infrastructure you know and and office product company an enterprise focus company they still have windows sure but it's not the same thing as when it was like windows versus you know mac os 15 years ago i think that's kind of evolved so is it a story sure do i think that it's going to hang up a deal i doubt it microsoft did come out with with new computers two weeks ago and said that they're mac killers y so there's still some there's still something uh still some friction there appreciate that uh distinction about the enterprise versus the consumer uh it's going to be an exciting

DeepTech315: Apple Earnings & AI / FSD in China,2024-05-03 18:30:15+00:00,15,wntGfGAOf84,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wntGfGAOf84,"welcome to this week's episode of deep tech 315 that's doug i'm jean our three topics today is nvidia mak some product announcements second is apple considering working with third parties for its foundation model and last is we have a new public company of peer play and social that being reddit and taking it back to the top the week kicked off with commentary with the woodstock of chip events i heard that there was like 10,000 people at this event crazy think like all this momentum has been sucked from apple over to these nvidia events pretty geeky audience but they're the ones who are really powering this ai paradigm shift and jensen made good on all the project uh projections predictions uh related to the event and announced the b100 chip uh that uh replaces effectively that will replace later this year the h200 which is kind of the high-end chip from nvidia now specs are roughly twice as fast for the b100 over the h200 and so kind of the easy analysis here is that this was largely expected uh given the leadup to it and things kind of leaked out which is pretty normal for these big tech events but there's some more substance behind this in terms of how it could impact i think the business more near- term yeah this is just a hypothesis something that we've been talking about internally uh we've we've kind of seen this in the past with apple for example when they release or they're at least known for let's say a pretty regular device update schedule and for some people when they're about to upgrade their phone particularly when the rumors are that the new iphone upgrade will be a meaningful one sometimes we see this hawthorn effect we've talked about this before even with tesla where customers wait and they say look i'll just wait for the next generation one you know i can i can suffer through another year with my current iphone and again this is just a hypothesis but we've kind of been talking internally given how powerful the b100 is and right now nvidia is selling the h200 so a good upgrade meup the b100 how powerful i kind of framed it in it's 2x the speed power of the h200 is that the right way to think about it it is i think that is right i mean ultimately you think about it in terms of total cost of ownership that's what jensen likes to talk about so you know if you're i forget what his exact saying is but something to the effect of if you buy chips you think about the price of chips if you build data centers you think about what is my total cost of ownership and so if you can get a chip that is 2x more efficient at handling these kinds of workloads and not pay 2x more to purchase the hardware install it etc etc then you should have an advantage in terms of total cost of ownership which is what it's all about makes sense so back inter you're talking about the hethon effect yeah just that i think it's worth asking and i wouldn't even say that this should be a base case but it's worth asking could nvidia see an air pocket here in the next quarter or two as customers know the b100 now is coming later this year do any customers you know pull back a little bit on their orders and say look you know we'll we'll pass on a few 100,000 let's say of the h2 200s we'll put that into b100s i would say i think it's possible and i like to try to put things into probability it's probably unlikely that that happens because we do have this really i think acute arms race right now to get compute for ai but i think it's at least worth thinking about if we were going to see one of those air pockets and people have kind of talked about this when could we see a slowdown in nvidia's demand maybe those are some of the ingredients that could go into it yeah maybe the read would be if nvidia gets through their next quarter is the april quarter so they're going to report that called the end of may but they get through the april quarter and they they don't talk about a slowdown in demand i mean bucking the hawthorne effect here i think is you could read this is like doubly positive for nvidia that they they buck the trend that that 10% chance didn't happen and uh i think that would be reaffirming for that kind of this idea we're still early in this um was was that it a lot of attention was it the b00 anything else talked about this making chips more affordable for the masses and was he talking about that total cost of ownership piece or like a lower price chip he always i think he's always sort of referencing some of the total cost of ownership thing that's what it always kind of goes back to for nvidia when they think about okay what is what is the value we're creating ultimately it's not just about the raw price of the chip um i would say though the price of the b1 100 talk about affordability it was a little bit lower i think than people were expecting you know he had said the price is going to be somewhere in that you know 30 to $4,000 range he's been out in the media saying that i've seen a $38,000 number uh online i believe and so you know that was a little lower than i think some people were thinking it could be kind of in the 40 to 50 range um so you know maybe maybe the chip is coming in a little bit more cost effective or cheaper hard to say cheaper at $38,000 but cheaper than maybe people expected let's shift to the second topic kind of breaking news uh late sunday early monday morning doug you sent me an email i was on vacation i read it early in the morning and i knew my day was going to be very different uh than what i thought when i went to bed on sunday night and that of course is mark gman who does great work uh in at bloomberg in terms of he's just got some incredible network inside of apple but reporting that apple is working or considering working working with google to license or gemini foundation model and or and also open ai and pre the previous dat of this to kind of bring all the pieces into this is apple had basically put out a white paper uh suggesting or saying that they working on a multimodal model of themselves and so there's like three things floating around here my reaction when i saw the news was uh this is really good for google because it's validating we've talked about all the challenges that google has had but validating for google uh the second piece is i couldn't remember when apple has licensed like a core competency i mean they they'll license some patents but this is very different than you know apple's been bringing core competency inhouse over the past decade a lot with the chip design pieces and uh getting into services and it feels like this vertically integration um mindset and so it it to me just hit at how fast apple needs to move at this or maybe how far behind they are that has gotten them to a point that they're considering licensing gemini to do some features ai powered features they may use their own model gemini and so that was my initial reaction was man things are changing a lot this obviously after them cancelling the titan project and it just feels like uh they've got a fire lit under them does and i would maybe invert one thing you said a little bit in terms of apple being far behind i actually think it's more about how far ahead open ai and google as much as we've sort of criticize them for being slow with their ai rollout and development really about how far ahead they are than everybody else and i think that this sort of uh integrates a little bit with another piece of news that came out yesterday which is that inflection which is uh highly well-funded startup they uh had a couple of their co-founders leaving to join microsoft to start ai uh microsoft's basically ai lab division there um and i think that that's kind of a sign for how hard it is this company raised over a billion dollars um to build large language models it's hard it's hard to build a really unique and dynamic model without access to unique data which we all know google has um obviously tremendous resources but then the distribution too that we've talked about which not only aids in getting the product used but also refining the product and making it better when you get feedback from users so i would actually give it more of a hey look how far ahead and and just the reality of the ai game a couple of these players are and apple just as for as much as apple has one thing they don't have is as much unique data as google or probably even open ai at this point in terms of what open ai is done with reinforcement learning from human feedback apple of course passes on a lot we don't know exactly how much a lot of that data because of their privacy focus approach and so they're not capturing a lot of that data that they could use they in my view are capturing enough data where they can train a model that is going to be valuable enough to make their products uh more useful with ai and we've in the past talked about this opportunity around personalized ai and this would be an idea have a kind of a subscription service where apple could uh you pay maybe $10 a month and then it does some basic tasks for you it can do calendar obviously the all the things around text and email but maybe even do some customer support resolution recommend uh different flights travel uh there's a lot of different ways that they could take it does partnering let's say they go the route of partnering with open ai or google and this view that that we have about their opportunity and personalized ai wouldn't that dilute the fact that google is has just a whole different approach to their privacy would that dilute how apple can approach a personalized ai product or maybe sell a personalized ai product i don't think so and there's there's two things that go into that one i mean almost everybody who uses apple products also uses google products i mean there's already i think an inherent level of trust or whatever you might want to call that terms of the crossing of the user base there um so i don't i don't personally think the privacy thing would be that big of a hurdle to figure out some work around too given that but the other thing is this the other piece of news that came out that was not as uh i don't think well reported or didn't have as much fanfare at least was that uh one of apple's ai researchers talked about a new paper that apple had published about a multimodal model that apple's been developing called the mm1 and so it's not that apple's going to do nothing i think it seems clear what they're looking to to figure out is the mm1 is largely a a smaller kind of parameter set model i think the largest uh number of parameters in those models that they did the paper on was 30 billion to put that into context both gemini and gpt 4 have been reported to have over one trillion so well more than 20 times in terms ers of magnitude difference here significantly bigger and what that means though specifically is that when you have a smaller size model the ability to run that locally on a device like a phone maybe is much greater and so what you could see is apple tries to figure out some llm where they're handling some of the real specific stuff that people want to do locally on device which could be calendaring and things like email you know they don't need necessarily pass that off to google but when somebody asks a question that's beyond what is sort of native to that in device experience you know like okay what's the capital of rome you or that is a capital right bad question but hopefully ai would get it right um they would pass that off right to google because that's not something that is core and like needs an immediate response you can have a second of latency grab it from gemini and bring it in i think either way you cut it from apple's perspective they just start infusing add of products whether through licensing to google or it's their own model i think that is would be viewed as a win in investors's mind just given haven't seen anything from them or not much nothing from generative ai and so we're going to jump to the final topic which is uh get to know reddit uh for those of you who have been living in a cave when it comes to meme stocks this of course is a social platform uh that uh off wall street bets did i get that right dog off wall street bets w stre bets just wall street bets thank you um made meme stocks of course part of our daily lives and uh they are now ready to go public uh just a little quick background on it is their private valuation pequ around $10 billion it's looking to go public around six six to seven billion something like that kind of initial valuation yeah six and a six and a half and this is uh they did last year 800 million in revenue uh growing at 20% and put that in perspective is snap last year did just under five billion in revenue growing at 14% so snap's market cap is 18 billion and then here we have reddit coming in at a call it six and a half billion market cap with one quarter of the revenue that snap has and it uh you know the first blush it just didn't really jive with me i think part of what is uh in the reddit story that people are excited about is there is an ai angle which is they've signed a deal with google um i believe it's either $50 or $60 million a year where redit is providing its data to google to train on and so i think there's some value at least theoretically there's some value in their data on an ongoing basis as you know these subreddits that are in some ways sort of localized expert networks um you can question maybe sometimes how much expertise is really in the networks but certainly there's a lot of knowledge about 100,000 different topics right there's 100,000 different communities i believe on reddit right now and so i think that that data is valuable obviously to google they're paying a lot of money for it and i think that as part of that you know some investors are viewing reddit as a potential ai beneficiary i wouldn't go that far i do think the data is useful but i also think now we're seeing kind of what's the market price for it well it's it's google it's it's mid eight figures a year um maybe open ai goes and pays something similar there's not many more customers that are probably going to be willing to pay that amount for that data so certainly it could be a good tailwind and a persistent source of revenue but i ultimately think the story about reddit is going to be if they can monetize through ad dollars you know probably not ai licensing dollars we'll obviously be staying tuned and following what happens and it's ipo on behalf of this episode of deep tech 315 that's doug i'm jean bye for now"
DeepTech315: Tesla FSD Probe / Apple iPad Event / Apple's Chips,2024-05-10 14:47:16+00:00,11,8aRkUWOJIfM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aRkUWOJIfM,welcome to pressure points our topic is previewing wwdc this is an event that i have been looking forward to for the past call it year and a half and apple investors if we look over the past month have also been looking forward to this shares of apple are up about 8% over the past month that compares to the nasdaq up about 5% and the big outlier of course is nvidia up 30% but the reason why nvidia is doing so well of course is really rel to ai and that is the broader a topic related to wwdc this year but the pressure point within that ai topic is siri and siri of course is the punchline of jokes for most people for those of us present company included that use it on a daily basis it's typically to make phone calls to know what the weather is like or to set a timer and those three use cases probably account for 80% of all use cases of siri but in fact are almost embarrassingly simple and when siri jumped into the game of a voice assistant 11 years ago uh initially through the phone and then now through most of apple's products i estimate there are just under two billion active apple devices monthly active devices that have a siri available on it that creates this essentially wrapper around our lives throughout our day that has access to this agent that very few of us use for good reason is that it just simply doesn't have value i think that that is going to change and the reason why that's the pressure point for wwdc is the ability for apple to make ai generative ai accessible on many devices throughout our day is a competitive advantage for apple and ultimately i think we'll do two things number one it will improve the retention of apple and their as people start to understand more how gener ai can be used throughout their day and separately create new revenue opportunities for apple around more advanced applications those revenue opportunities could come in the form of more revenue from the app store or their own generative agent type of products that they can come out with over time so getting siri right just because it's so ubiquitous throughout our day even though most of us are not using it is important and it's critically important because i think many will give siri another chance when they hear that it does have some generative more of a conversation like uh type of context to it and i think that uh this is a window where they can really rewrite how consumers think about siri and use this as the primary fabric that we're going to be interacting with ai so what does that actually mean in terms of using sir to interact with generative ai we can ask it to do certain things get me an uber to the airport you could ask to order food you could ask to book uh different reservations uh you can ask siri of course to complete tasks uh find a calendar time that works for me and these three people you could ask siri to uh uh navigate things uh or create generative messages whether it's text messages or emails if really is endless what you can do with generative ai and siri voice is a logical interface around that and so i think this is a huge opportunity for apple to do something that is unique to apple which is having that device and operating system the privacy all that ecosystem working together series of fabric that a thread that goes through all of that and i think by empowered with generative ai is going to be an opportunity to rewrite apple's ai um the chapter of apple and ai so that's the pressure points all eyes are on there uh i'll get through some other topics there's a lot of rumors about other things that going go on but i think the other most important one is related to an ai partnership and this most likely of course is going to be with open ai and this has two pieces to it on one side a deal would essentially allow apple to make up for lost ground over the past 3 five years around missing generative ai and they can quickly within a few months get all these incredible open ai experiences that they've shown uh throughout the last couple years and more recently at their developer day into apple's products and so what that means is you think about the mac or the os operating system the mac os the mac operating system really hasn't changed since the mouse and that was a big breakthrough but having generative ai built into the operating system will just change how we interface we will no longer be searching for documents it will just be very simple show me all my uh conversations whether it's documents or texts or emails that have to do with articles on corporation and boom we'll have it there uh there'll be other efficiencies in terms of how we create content within different applications with apple applications or third parties but just the whole look and feel of the operating system will change by embedding a third party like open a of course they showed this with windows and co-pilot and open ai a year plus ago and so it's not a breakthrough in that sense but it will be a breakthrough for apple users and i think we'll see some demos of how we're going to see generative ai within the operating system so that's that's one layer to this relationship is really uh catapulting how we're going to use the operating system of course another is is within siri really powering more of a conversation like experience and for all the benefits that we just talked about that' be another logical leap forward when it comes to uh this partnership it's something that they have to do it would simply to wait two three more years for apple to build this on their own would give up way too much ground and so they're making the right decision to do this but i do want to emphasize that this is unprecedented for apple to be outsourcing a core technology from a third party very different than what they've had with the default search and google this is a big deal and i think it means that probably over the next three years apple's ai destiny is really in the hands of open ai uh similar microsoft's destiny is in the hands of open ai and amazon is in the hands of anthropic uh this is uh just the reality of starting late to to the game that these companies have had and so uh the right move to do it picks up time but it creates a longer term problem and i think that apple will work to put in motion in is working to start to solve for that problem and specifically is that they're going to be adding uh their own models they're going to be having small language models which we'll probably hear about at wwdc and those are models that do something very specific on your phone could be something related to your watch and understanding what's going on with your heart rate uh that is very specific to a device but they also will advance coming out with their own foundation model uh they have a project ajax that's well known that this is them building their own foundation model so i believe over the next three years uh all problems turn into opportunities and this will create a big opportunity for apple to come out with their own foundation model and so that's uh not the the pressure point but an important other topic is just the dynamics around working with the third party as far as what the economic relationship is going to be i essentially think this is going to be a wash between apple and open aai if it ends up being open ai uh you can build a case that there's a big benefit to apple because all the things that we just talked about therefore apple should pay open ai several billion dollars a year you could look at it that open ai is trying to get distribution despite all that we talk about open a they still only have a few hundred million daily active users and uh that is small relative to where they want to get to and having distribution through apple devices that have don't have friction around accessing that technology is a big opportunity for open ai so they want to they may want to pay apple several billion dollars a year for that access i think you put it together it's probably a financially a wash open a by the way one benefit for them to have access to to these devices is it does create an opportunity for developers to want to build more with open ai to have products that work on those devices and then they get paid open ey does get paid through uh selling tokens and so that's the financial piece to it but bigger picture right decision for apple longer term i think that they need to uh go edit their own and build their own financial model so i want to bring it all together here and at the highest level i think that uh ww see well it may not be a win for apple stock the day of or the day after because the natural buying the rumor selling the news i think that this event will be critical and important because it starts in motion the ability for apple to capitalize on something that only that they can do which is bring hardware software services together uh uh infuse ai into that those three pieces that no other company does and add a piece around privacy that i think really will resonate with consumers in the decade ahead as ai becomes a staple of our lives so i think apple's going to be a big beneficiary i remain a shareholder and i'm excited about the longterm potential related to ai and apple on behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now
DeepTech315: GPT-4o / Google I/O / Apple's AI Options,2024-05-17 14:42:02+00:00,16,6yNWi_J1kew,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNWi_J1kew,[music] welcome to pressure points i'm jean mster from deep waterer asset management and our topic today is tsmc as in taiwan semi if there was going to be a magnificent eight i believe that this company should be just that that eighth company uh the stock is new to many of you so i'm going to spend a minute and just talk about what the company is a little bit about what they do why the stock is moving today but then jump into the pressure point which is what is unique and why this company has a sustainable long-term advantage and so back to the top in terms of the company this is a 570 billion us doll market cap company they're of course based in taiwan they do most of their advanc node manufacturing this is about 70% of their revenue this is kind of the more difficult chips to build customers like apple nvidia you do most of that in china and in taiwan call it 90% of that's done in china and taiwan they started an initiative to diversify they're building a couple campuses in arizona for example one of them's going to come online next year the second one probably in 2028 but they are looking to diversify and want to get to more or less a 5050 mix of building chips really to try to reduce some of that geopolitical risk and that geopolitical risk is one of the reasons why the stock has underperformed many investors don't want to touch this because it is in the crosshairs of geopolitical tension at deep water uh we are comfortable with this that that risk given the opportunity and have been adding to an initiating a position over the last several months uh during the last year the stock is up 23% that compares the nasdaq that's up 37% so this has lagged and i believe the biggest reason why it's lagged is the geopolitical piece but also 2023 was a tough year for tsmc is that their business essentially was down down 4% revenue was down 4% year-over-year that come came off 2022 where the business was up like 40% and the reason for the big decline was the smartphone market uh it slow down and that had a negative impact on their overall business nvidia and all the good things that are going on in chips did have a positive impact but that's still high single digits in terms of overall revenue for tsmc so all the good things going on in ai just simply weren't enough to move the needle in 2023 going forward we think that that will change and as far as uh why the stock on their december earnings is up 7% is because they guided 2024 revenue to be up 25% the street was at 20% growth and they gued earnings to be grow a little bit quicker than what most had expected they'll grow around 18 to 20% previously the street was looking for 16% growth and so when you put all this together it is a a positive combination of coming out of a bad period related to smartphones in 2023 and some more optimism that that's going to stabilize and they them getting a little bit more benefit from their chips uh their some of these ai chips but that's where kind of most of the conversation traffic's in and i think the pressure point is much deeper than the surface of their guidance for 2024 what's important here is tsmc is doing something that no one else can do uh they are building chips they not only are those chips difficult to build from a technical perspective the vast majority of tsmc employees have an advanced degrees in physics or mathematics or engineering is that not only are they difficult to build but there is a high customer service piece to this these these are really the the the the the beating heart of these devices uh whether it is from apple or nvidia and ultimately is they have to work clos closely with these these customers to ensure that their products get out the door and so that customer service piece along with the technical uh aspect to it is what really separates uh tsmc hear stories about their engineers going in in the middle of the night to make sure that the products for nvidia are continuing to advance and that they're not having any sort of downtime and on a from a technical basis the most advanced nodes right now are these three nanometer nodes and that basically just means it's a really fast chip the other company out there who has 3 nmet chips is samsung but their yields are not as good and so the prices tend to be a little bit higher and the quality is not as reliable and so tsmc really stands alone when it comes to this very technical task of of of producing these chips and not only are the is the staff difficult to uh bring together to do this but also the factories take years to build as we're seeing in in arizona one of those is being delayed but the big picture is this really hard business to compete in and given their technical advantage and building those most advanced chips and the reality that the demand for these most advanced chips are going to accelerate in the next few years based on ai puts tsmc in a great place to really ride this wave the pix and shovels be really the substance of the company that powers the ai revolution the big risk here of course is the geopolitical we recognize that if something would go aride with taiwan this would be a material negative i don't know what the percentage impact would be to tsmc shares but it would be a material negative and we think that that risk is low relative to the opportunity so the pressure point tsmc is doing something that nobody can do in an area that's going to be increasingly critical to building ai infrastructure over the next 5 to 10 years on behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now
Pressure Points: Nvidia 1Q'25 Earnings,2024-05-22 22:36:03+00:00,7,Vvi_2E7Y6As,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vvi_2E7Y6As,welcome to deep tech 315 we got a fun episode today we're going to be breaking down everything from open the eyes developer day microsoft and last wp and talk about what this means for apple and going to the top of the list and also the beginning of the week there on monday open ai has their they call it spring dev day and it was a 26 minute keynote doug you know me i'm a man of gravity absolutely love that uh spoiler alert google was almost two hours long but 26 minutes and i want you to go first on your reaction to what we saw for open ai i mean the biggest takeaway i think uh they do live demos and live demos are always more impressive even when they have little hiccups and there were some little hiccups if you paid attention closely to uh the unveil of gp40 but the bottom line is i mean i thought it was kind of a direct shot across google's bow and not very veiled by the way i mean open ai has made a habit of this where they kind of hold an event right two three four five days ahead of google's known event that's announced to announce uh you know what they're doing and steal some of their thunder it's it's startup playbook 101 they can move faster and be more nimble than google as a smaller company but i thought the first thing i thought was look what they just did live with gpt 40 was all of the stuff that google promised in a edited video a couple months ago when they unveiled gemini like literally it just worked the translated language in real time it read images in real time help you with your homework um it was really promising it's not gp5 i think when we talk about gpt 5 we might start to see the model understand things like mathematics more which would be a huge evolution but it was a meaningful step forward and i think it shows that open ai still has the baton for the lead in best ai model in the world right now that was my takeaway as well that i felt open ai got i'll call a six month lead on google and i also honed in on that concept that these are live demos and uh we talk more about google those were recorded demos but that stuck out to me that they just believe more or ready to show their products more uh the the other piece to it of course uh throughout this the the general headline from my perspective is this is the first real live demo of the multimodal models we' were talking about those for six months those of course is just going beyond a text input to using sound and basically listening ability a scene vision ability even the ability to read your emotions uh bringing all that together and it was i would say i was different adjectives i've used after watching it was it was amazing spectacular and mind-blowing and i think it it it does uh those are are are are wi are selective adjectives i think just describe really how powerful what we're seeing and the other piece i took away you know this kind of introduction of the multimodal model in reality is one big takeaway that i had the other was like my optimism that ai is ultimately going to the substance will exceed the hype my optimism that increased because i'm seeing little things that they're doing you gave some examples of that and i highly recommend people watch this 26 minute demo but i'm seeing glimpses of what can be built and we're still talking about artificial narrow intelligence here imagine what happens with general intelligence so i think it was a really big deal because i think it it just shows that uh the pace that we're moving and it it increases my view that they're going to be a key player here and as i kind of put it all together i think like the last round was done at like 95 billion dollar like is this going to be a trillion dollar company someday it's one of the few in the world that has a chance to get there there's not many companies that you could say that about even a bunch of companies that are probably at 34500 billion i don't know if you could honestly say i think it's going to get to a trillion but if everything goes right i mean this is sort of venture capital 101 the question you have to ask yourself is if everything goes right not what goes wrong that's what public market investors need to ask but if everything goes right for open ai i don't see how they don't become a trilli dollar company and that everything goes right is it's one of the four foundation models that basically all applications are built on uh because every application is going to have some element of ai that's the and they get paid on the tokens on on that is that that everything going right in a nutshell well i would say everything going right is they are undoubtedly the leading model of the big four i mean the big four i think are and we agree with this fairly well defined it's open ai i think they're still clearly in the lead gemini is probably somewhere behind them and then on the open source side obviously you have llama 3 with meta you could argue or debate where to put things like anthropics claude or mraw on the open source side i think grock with uh with xai is kind of a dark horse because of the unique data that that will eventually have but to me those are the big four it's open ai it's google it's meta and then ultimately it's xai uh you know they might be the one that could really mess things up that's um my rank too and but that's the ba the basic idea of everything going right is they're a leading model everything is built on top of this five 10 years from now exactly yeah makes a ton of sense and again if you if you think what you see with that 26 minute minute video is impressive just wait till we get to general intelligence super exciting stuff so let's shift gears move to tuesday google has their io event and my mind is like i just saw something incredible on monday and everything you tell me now google is going to be measured against what open ai uh just said and exactly what open ai wanted exactly how they mission accomplished and uh what were uh what were some of your observations and you're probably running that same um calculus in your head what jumped out to you from google i mean i thought google still did a good job obviously we own we own the stock i'll try to set aside that bias it's one of our key holdings in our flagship titan fund but i thought they did a good job of showing that their model continues to advance i think they are the clear number two you think about uh the capabilities of these various large language models and specifically there's two things i think that stood out to me one was they're absolutely getting more aggressive integrating the ai results into search results which i think is a natural evolution and it'll be a huge distribution tailwind for them in terms of getting people to use ai and then two i think they are showing that they're going to be much more aggressive on the device side trying to integrate this into android glasses or or some sort of camera based product they sort of teased as well so those were the big two things um i do think there's there's one thing just about that idea of integrating ai in search that is worth thinking about i had this conversation with somebody the other day which is most average people in the world like we're nerds we like to use ai and play with it and test it most people don't care they don't know what chat gbt is they don't know what gemini is they don't know what a search generative experience is but when they start seeing that search response change and giving you direct answers giving you longer answers these generative answers a lot of people think are just going to say hey that's pretty cool like google's better now and i don't think that's going to make them want to go over to chat gbt and it's probably not going to make them curious about ai either they're just going to say well okay google just became a better product for me i'm going to keep using it like i've used it before and my experience is just that much better i think that's an important thing to think about when we think about how does this play out over the long term it's going to be hard to change people's behavior google still has you captive and if they make your experience better with ai they're just going to lock you in that much more yeah that uh you hit it right on that the search piece is definitely the elephant in the room related to io from my perspective i was kind of got caught on my eyes got distracted with the are these live demos are they recorded demos and uh but really the the substance i think was they're doing a lot in ai like you said with the device this astra ability to use where basically cheap glasses and with a camera on it to be able to take in the world around you it's was remarkable uh that was a a piece that really open a i didn't have they had something kind of like it but i think that that kind of stood alone but back to the search piece is suar hit it early in their in the in the event talking about search within the first few minutes and then they kept coming back to it and like you said is that they're going to be launching these ai overviews and so i've been playing around with it i've actually now i'm i'm seeing it in my google results but just to give a quick example is that when you ask it more of a a question that needs an explanation versus a commerce question uh your results start out and you see the the generative box right there right up on top um as i experimented with different uh prompts uh that i would call it uh information related uh prompts that i thought they would all come up as a generative result i noticed that some times they had uh they were defaulting to putting the sponsored results ahead at times ahead of some of these generative results so kind of the piece the window that's generating kind of moves throughout the page which tells you they're keeping close eyes on the connection between uh putting a prompt in a search in and keeping that monetization going but i definitely thought it was a point of strength the fact that they're rolling this out to everyone in the us in the next week and then i think they wanted go globally by the end of the year like they're embracing this this shift so they must be seeing something good so this whole idea that google's going to get displaced you gave the kind of the the logical explanation of why but just from my perspective really stood out the pace that they're embracing this over ai overview and search results i would say was most encouraged and i think too when you talk about where they're putting that generative response on the page in your testing eventually you're going to see ads that generative response i mean there's in my op like like sponsor generative results exactly are you going to trust the results if they're sponsored i think you will you you trust google's results right now when they're sponsored i think they'll be disclosed just like at today you'll see that this is a sponsored you know it has whatever it could be perhaps the top let's say you say uh you know i have this problem with my car it makes this knocking sound let me play the sound for you and the gener response might oh that sounds like your spark plugs are bad or something right uh would you like to call the best mechanic in the area that happens to be right on google's local search page and i'm sure that mechanic would be happy to pay for that call you know that that's a good experience though and can it be delineated as sponsored absolutely does it give a great customer experience absolutely does it make the advertiser happy absolutely that's the way we're going to go with it i think so we just had the two big models the kind of leading models talk and my attention quickly shifted to june 10th and what do you think all this means for apple i think it's important who they choose ultimately for their partner in ai i mean now there's reports out saying that it might be open ai not google a couple months ago it was it seemed seemed like it could be google um on the ai side to help power some of apple's experiences and given how much google showed kind of what they were doing with cameras what they were doing with android really trying to integrate the model particularly uh the the nano model right to work on device in an android device it begs the question of if apple does end up going with open ai which is the most recent report does google feel like it needs to take a more aggressive role in building hardware um it may because i think that ultimately hardware is how we will interact with these ai uh interfaces and if they're kind of locked out of the main device in the us they might feel like you know hey we need to come out into the market and we need to make really good devices that maybe still aren't quite as good as apples but give them more of a run for their money than they do right now yeah i didn't think of that device kind of angle to this and what that means for android and google they've historically been a little bit shy at going there my sense was that it's very clear that apple needs to partner with somebody everything we saw from open eye google day it's so far ahead and so hard and expensive to build and apple needs to do this it's been rumored something's going to come it will be announced on june 10th my money that is is on that it's google the reason why is they've got this big search relationship right now 15 billion and a year and i'm sure that that's going to kind of play into this and um that relationship is that dynamic is probably going to get renegotiated as part of this i think in the end apple's actually going to get paid more from google in total because this is a form of distribution essentially for google to work and so i think that this is a uh apple's actually going to take money in in this relationship and i want to give you final word in the the the 30 seconds we've got left here uh do you think apple is going to be the one paying for this relationship or get paid it's a really important question and i think you could make an argument for either way i understand the distribution component of it the other side though is you this is something that apple obviously to your point they they can't do at the same level that open ai does or that google does so i think it's 5050 i mean i think you could see an arrangement where you know maybe it's almost kind of a neutral thing where google or open ai says we love the distribution but you know we can't pay you because we're running really expensive infrastructure and we're not monetizing this right now and apple says look we understand we're giving you great distribution you've got costs on your side but we have to create an incredible experience for our users we can't do it without without you so i wouldn't be surprised if if the monetary exchange is is maybe actually more muted in the beginning and that probably evolves over time as one side or the other figures out how to monetize it more makes a ton of sense on behalf of this week deep tech 315 bye for now
DeepTech315: Nvidia / AI Dev Days / Robotaxi Predictions,2024-05-24 16:18:32+00:00,15,vo5xK_jprMY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo5xK_jprMY,"welcome to deep tech 315 i'm jean along with doug our three topics this week are google's gemini model second amd talking a big game about the demand for their chips and last take two the waiting game continues with grand theft auto we'll take it to the top and some point of perspective is google announced showed a preview of their new gemini product they announced a gemini pro is now out in the wild and for as a quick background is gemini is google's foundation model this would be similar to gpt from open ai cloud from anthropic and llama from meta i guess grock from x. aai all those are important to ai of course and it's been a waiting game the previous model from google is palm and it has not stood up well against open ai but here we've got a four-minute teaser video that they announc and they're going to have this kind of the prime version or the the beefed up version is called gemini ultra and that's going to be out early or sometime next year and so i can say as google investors here at deep water we've been sweating this one dog to to wait and see what gemini look like the video gives you some optimism at least that they are still alive in the ai race it felt like for a little bit uh maybe they had missed it maybe they were too maybe they were too conservative and i think the video with gemini if you haven't seen it you should watch it we should link to it here with this video uh it's cool because it shows the power of the model and really what's i think the incremental thing that gemini is sort of bring to the table is that it's natively multimodal meaning it understands text it understands images it understands videos and so in the video they'll show you know a picture for example of a duck that someone was drawing the model understands it's a duck then they show it a rubber duck it understands it's a rubber duck and so it kind of gets you know broader context and it understands and i i will say understands in quotes because we could debate what that means for a large language model but it sort of understands the world in a bit of a different way than the models that we're used to for now and that that multimodal piece like you said you can interface with it with text with voice with images with video like that is is as you mentioned it feels like kind of the breakthrough and i was thinking where does where does gbt 4 stand when it comes to the multimodal site gp4 has some multimodal capabilities and then ultimately when we see gpt 5 which open a has sort of teased a little bit who knows what the timing is on that but i suspect that that will be natively multimodal so it's a pretty fast follower game here makes sense you got the leaders kind of leap frogging fast following and we kind of think of it as google is going to be one of the top three ultimately and and i think that there the the investments they've made since 2017 recall in 2017 they changed their message to wall street from being organize the world's information to being an ai first company we used to count how many times they talked about ai on their conference calls back in 2017 it it was like 20 times well before it was in vogue and i think we're starting to see some of the the fruits of of that labor and was delighted to to to see it and i think when i think about google the investment more broadly is that there's this case that google is basically gonna kind of lose its its its presence because search is going to be everywhere with these different foundation models allowing search to be inputed everywhere and from our perspective is that google still has the data of search for the last call it 20 years and that should help inform them and help them kind of transition to being a place first and from my perspective it's when i think about this model and gemini and the potential it's just about getting people to interact more with google and then by the way do some search along with that but just kind of increasing engagement i've always felt like search kind of stands on its own in some ways against these large language models i mean the thing that these large language models are so powerful for in these generative models is creativity is it's enhancing creativity and it's helping humans build on ideas i mean search fundamentally doesn't do that search answers questions so a large language model could answer a question and it'll get better at answering questions over time if you want to know what the state capital is of new york um but that's not first of all it's not a monetizable query for google so it doesn't really matter um and second of all it's not really that compelling of a use case that's not google's killer use case i think google's killer use case is you're looking for a product right you're looking for a service and then ultimately google can connect you to do a transaction we haven't seen a i in my opinion at least we haven't seen how generative ai is going to play into that space yet now maybe it'll ultimately start making recommendations for products and services um we've seen some experiments actually on on uh b in gpt uh big gpt uh that have been interesting like they actually just have paid ads stapled the bottom it's a it's not a good experience it's not what's going to happen in the future but that's what i think is still sort of unclear search is not going to compete with you know trying to write a poem or craft an email it never never was but the question is how much is gpt how much are the generative models going to compete with that commerce angle over time and that's still not clear certainly in danger for google but they've got a pretty good place in the game now with gemini yeah my my thought is just get as much usage on google as possible we estimate about 40% of queries right now are information related that's going to be impacted by gemini and and just get more people to spend more time on google more shots on goal when they want to do search and like you said is probably eventually it's a function of time before we start getting ads more native inside of these generative results so um i'm still my money's still on google that they're going to come out in a good spot here uh we're going to shift to our second topic which is amd they had an event uh their ceo lisa sue talked about all the good things that they're doing and i kind of feel like amd's just been left out of the exciting part of the hardware conversation it is an investment within our deepwater frontier tech index that etf that's from innovator that we do have uh amd in there and i'm glad to see that they're starting to show some strength and kind of increasing their potential they're talking about more business that they're going to be doing with some of the hyperscalers here and but as i listened to the the presentation i was still struggling with this concept of the cpu versus the gpu and when you listen to nvidia it's all about the gpu and that's the architecture that's best for ai compute and and here we are amd which i believe is more cpu related and they're selling a lot of those chips so how should we what's your take on just kind of how the stack plays out well amd makes both they make cpus and gpus and i would say where they've come from was they were a left for dead company a decade ago they were always the second run player in cpus behind intel and they always were the second run player in gpus behind nvidia and now those worlds are somewhat coming together i think you could argue and that's sort of what the product was or at least one of the products they announced yesterday the mi 300a uh so is that a gp that well they have a couple products so they have the mi30 which is a pure ai accelerator and then they have uh what they're calling apus or accelerated processing units it compete with nvidia's hopper product which is a gpu and a cpu sort of embedded together to work together for accelerated compute okay and so that's one got a comparable product line to nvidia they do i mean there's they're directly competing with nvidia with what they launched yesterday for sure and i think the reality is to your point amd has not been in this conversation as much outside of i think people who know tech and who follow ai mostly because nvidia has probably 80 or 90% market share for accelerated compute for ai uh in data centers right now so i mean they're just so giant and they're so dominant but i think the amd product is strong i think that the hyperscalers uh and the people who are building you know large language models and foundational models they want alternatives to nvidia they just even if just for diversity right you just to continue to have nvidia have someone on their heels to push the envelope and amd is doing that do you know anything on the pricing side i was trying to get you know is there a pricing advantage to doing amd there's not a pricing advantage i think the price is going to end up being comparable to an h100 uh from nvidia which can run in the tens of thousands to hundred hundred of thousands of um the thing that i thought was most important though from the event you say tens or hundreds of thousands is is that for like a a cluster of compute or a single chip it's big price tag they're not cheap no acceler compute expensive that's how you grow your business from growing 20% uh to growing 200% last quarter and 300 this quarter over a three quarter period to take that off when you're selling a lot of $100,000 chips that helps so makes sense i interrupted you i forgot where we're going there i think yeah the bigger picture thing though that i think was important from amd's event was they were previously talking about accelerated compute being $150 billion opportunity in 2027 they increased that number to 400 billion so more than doubled their estimate for big this market is it's good for them it's good for nvidia it's probably good for you know everybody in the ai space given how much demand that amd seems to be seeing to be confident to raise their numbers like that and good for amd stock this past week it's up 7% the nasdaq during that period is up just over a percent i forgot to mention google had a nice move on that gemini preview and it was up 4% in the past week if i mentioned the nasdaq up 1.2 2% which gets us to our third topic of a stock that's down 4% over the past week and that being take to i don't know how long we've been waiting waiting for uh the grand theft auto the next version is it has it been a decade it's been a decade 2013 i think was the last one okay so 10 years and uh as it plays forward what was the context it got leaked out that or they had a promo video and and investors started to fill in the blanks that it's not going to come out next year it'll probably be 2025 this video they announced they were going to put out a video to show the game uh it came out a day early right and then yeah the context of the timing is sort of 2025 in my opinion it's relevant it doesn't really matter though i mean this is the most important game the most important title in gaming period it it doesn't that's the reason why the stock was down that it got push back for fast money yeah but i'm saying from a business standpoint from an actual cash flow that the company generates it doesn't matter right um a timing of a quarter to me is is irrelevant but you know markets markets do what markets do uh some people aren't playing for what the game's actually going to do they're just playing for the announcement um which is not what we're interested in we're interested in like how good is the game going to be and then even bigger picture you think about gta 5 that is a 10-year-old game but it's something that the company is been continually updating over 10 years you know it went from just a game that you went you paid $60 for it retail to gta online which was this robust sort of ongoing living world that they kept updating with new content and we're going to see that with gta 6 from the outset and that's what's really exciting to me is what is the new version of gta look like with a more modern uh online experience bringing people together in this new world which will be set on miami and this is going to be by order of magnitude the biggest upgrade in console games and so exciting to even though it's still a ways out exciting to think that i suspect that take two shares are going to they pull back here and then they start to move higher in anticipation of it maybe get gets pushed back but like you said it doesn't that delay doesn't change the reit this is a big upgrade take two is taking a little bit of issue with this and kind of reminding investors this week like we got more than just grand theft auto don't forget about our other franchises and i don't know i still think it's all about grand theft auto i mean it is like i said it's grand theft auto is i think the biggest and most important title in gaming uh some people might not agree with that but it's it sold 180 million copies since it came out it's one of the greatest as gta 5 a decade ago one of the biggest selling games in history and this is going to be the biggest game launch in history so they do have other great titles i mean they have a great sports franchise with nba 2k they have red dead redemption um so they've got they have a good portfolio and they need to have a good portfolio every great gaming company does but every great gaming company also has a lead title and it's hard for anything to really compete with gta well i i guess we'll end with a question here well the person uh on this podcast who is most likely to play gta 6 please raise their hand now i'll probably play it but i have i have kids now you know that i didn't have a decade ago so my bandwidth for gaming is far less than i wish it was understand either way we're gonna own a copy on behalf of doug jean and deep tech 315 bye for now"
DeepTech315: WWDC Preview / OpenAI's Partnerships,2024-05-31 19:04:15+00:00,14,ze47ngWEMHg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ze47ngWEMHg,"welcome to pressure points our topic is tesla's march quarter deliveries we're going to recap the march quarter deliveries and then hit the pressure point which is when will this storm pass and the deliveries were ugly down about 9% year over-year compared to expectations of up a couple percent that is about 387,000 vehicles delivered they did produce about 12% more vehicles than they delivered we'll get to that in just a second here in the press release the company did break out three reasons for the softness first they talked about the change over to the new model 3 and fremont i would put that in the category of something that could have a negative impact on production keep in mind production was better than expected the second is they talked about an arson fire in the berlin gigafactory i would put that as impacting production and again production was better than expected and then the third they talked about some of the conflict in the red sea related to shipp uh i would see that as something that does impact deliveries and so i think that one of the three reasons to me kind of lines up with having an impact on deliveries but that's the companies uh how they're framing what's going on in the march quarter from my perspective i think there are two big things that are going on and one very small thing uh the two biggest things are i believe that uh this interest rate environment i do believe that the higher cost typically 10% more for the price of an electric vehicle at a 7% interest rate that's uh we're talking about an average monthly payment for a tesla around $750 it's a lot of money and i think that that has having a negative impact on on demand the second is i think that just some of the excitement related to evs has worn off and a year and a half two years ago i didn't fully appreciate how much that excitement probably caused a pull forward in demand and specifically somebody who would buy a car like once every 5 years when you uh get excited about a new technology and want to be an early adopter maybe you purchase a car at a three-year interval and that essentially pulls demand which would have been in 24 or 25 into 22 or 23 and so i think that there is some of that factor going on here as as well so the third those are the two biggest drivers which i attribute the soft delivery numbers to the third factor which a lot of people are talking about is on's brand starting to have a negative impact on demand and i think the the net of this is probably a slight negative and uh two things in in motion here uh uh elon is with one group of buyers is distancing himself by his actions is turning off a a group of of buyers and i think there's probably an equal siiz group that is probably turned on by elon and some of the things that he does and they like that too i think when you put those two forces together it's probably a slight negative and again to force rank the three things going on i think it's price i think it's a pull forward effect related to some of the excitement around evs and then down further but still third on the list is some of elon's brand in the us because i think the us numbers were particularly soft so that's what i think is going on that's just the setup now we're going to get to the pressure point which is how long is this going to last and so we've gone from in the december quarter the 23 they grew deliveries about 20% now we're at minus 8 the street going into this before they had reported this was looking for around 15 20% type of delivery growth for calendar 24 i think that number is going to be closer to 10% and so uh that when revisions happen that's probably a negative in the near term for the stock for next year the street's looking for kind of similar growth rates for calendar 25 kind 15% i think those are actually going to be just fine and even if they're not we're going to get closer to the point of this lower price vehicle coming out in 26 where in 2025 investors are going to be looking forward to that so when i put all this together as far as uh is this going to pass is there something fundamentally wrong with tesla uh uh i do not believe there's anything wrong i think that this story is intact i think uh it's intact because i believe electrification is just a better way way to move around on top of that i think autonomy is a better way to move around as well and i think tesla continues to invest and lead in that whether car companies are slowing their investment so uh this is a step back i don't think we're at the bottom in terms of where the stock could go in the near term as those numbers for 2024 continue to be revised downward probably through when they report their quarter and i do think on the other side of this the company's going to come out in a good place um uh give a teaser alert to a future front uh pressure point uh podcast we're just going to talk about the fsd beta and how that's going but today it's about delivery numbers it was ugly i do believe this in fact will this storm will pass and behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now"
Pressure Points: WWDC Preview,2024-06-06 16:44:24+00:00,11,QHO0-hd0sC4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHO0-hd0sC4,welcome to deep tech 315 i'm jean moner along with doug clinton this is where we talk about the three most important things in tech once a week and we have 15 minutes to talk about that we're running the clock right now doug and we're going to jump right in our first topic is related to everything that's going on in the world that is catching all the headlines it's heartbreaking to see these headlines coming out of the middle east it is reminds me of a lot of heartbreak headlines that i've seen over the last couple years related to what's going on in ukraine and also uh makes me think about the potential what china may be thinking relative to taiwan and even more conflict in the world and as uh hard it is to do to kind of step beyond uh all the the personal uh impact that's the these conflicts are having is to to step maybe through that for a brief minute and talk about what it means for tech and this week we saw shares of north rook grummond locki martin those up call it 10 plus perc uh nasdaq was up 3% also crowd strike which is a cyber security company up 133% this week pretty clear uh both of those companies or all three of those companies by the way are either in the our loop in frontier tech index uh or in our our long only fund and if we uh think about the impact of this conflict doug can you just maybe take a step back and give us uh a little bit of a a history about what has changed in terms of how uh uh technology is impacting the tools that are used in uh in some of this in some of these conflicts in the old world you know companies like a lockheed or northrup that you just mentioned they would sort of get orders from the military the military would say we want to build x fighter jet uh there would be budget to do that to figure out how do we create this incredible piece of technology and fighter jets are incredible pieces of technology uh and then these defense primes as they're known would go and they would do that what's changed more recently with uh we can call them modern defense primes or we kind of just call uh emerging technology companies in in the defense bace defense tech companies like an andero uh they actually go and they sort of do r&d like a traditional software company they go and they experiment they build products and then they show what they've built uh to the military and they convince the military that this is something that they need and want and obviously there's a dialogue there that even goes uh into that before they go and create product but companies like andreil are really leading the charge it's a 10 billion doll private company we have exposure to it in our public private hybrid fund um it's one of the companies that we think is probably especially given this conflict you just mentioned one of the most important companies in the world right now in terms of thinking about where the world is going and some of the uh unfortunate i think tensions that are going to be persistent here yeah the the tensions are going to be persistent they're potentially be increasing and uh just to kind of capture that arc is that uh there's a consumer products almost approach that companies like andre are taking where they say this is the tech that we have and this is how we think it should be implemented and then they show it to different governments to see if they'll buy that's right okay and are there i'm just curious if you think about their portfolio of products and real specifically are there things that are unique that we wouldn't have been thinking about five years ago well really what they've done is they've created lattice as their core product it's you can think of it as sort of an operating system for the battlefield feld and what it does is it helps monitor and sort of combine everything that might be going on in the modern battlefield so think about your old battlefield you might have had some vehicles air and ground support you might have had some uh some people troops on the ground in the new modern battlefield not only do you have that you also have a lot of autonomous vehicles you have drones you have uavs you have autonomous ground vehicles and you even have perhaps submersibles and so what and is doing and and i think what maybe we wouldn't have seen if andel hadn't built it is this concept of sort of a unified operating system that really combines all the pieces of the modern battlefield um that i don't know that you know northrup would have created makes a ton of sense uh we're just hitting the five minute mark which means we're going to go on to our second topic here thank you motor trend for publishing i think they called it an investigated documentary it was like 15 minutes long where they were talking about what's going on in mexico related to batteries and evs and how it potentially could impact the us and as someone who spends a lot of time thinking about electric cars autonomy thinking about tesla how traditional car makers are are building for that transition i have this like great wall in my mind uh it is everything that's going on in europe and the west and then there's everything and electrification and cars that are going on in china and all the success that i hear that byd is having i think that ford and gm and tesla don't have to worry about it because it's over there in china but motor turn's reporting that over the past three years china's made uh a step up an investment they talked about going from about $200 million a year that's an m not a b to about $500 million a year in investment in some of this infrastructure related to um manufacturing of electric vehicles in mexico so those numbers are still pretty small mexico is a small market it's sell about a million vehicles a year the us sells about 20 million vehicles a year but if you' go and look at some of the language in the recent adjustments to nafta is that uh to that uh cars made in mexico if there's 65% assembled or greater then they can come to the us and avoid it's like a 35 or 40% tariff so the basic idea of this motor trend was can uh mexico be the trojan horse where eventually we get into uh the us and i'm going to uh save my opinion i want like you to go first doug i' like to have the luxury of going second but uh if you think about that and think about let's just uh fast forward byd is going to be probably building a manufacturing plant in mexico tesla of course has talked about their factory gigafactory that's coming up in monteray there's just more action going on uh there and uh play this forward and say uh that we're going to have chinese uh electric car makers uh on showroom floors uh what do you think the reaction is going to be is is the us ready for chinese cars i think it depends on the quality i think as it often does i don't know that um just because they're chinese cars that that would have a stigma or not certainly there's a growing i think political element to that uh that's worth thinking about but i think at the basis level if the byd cars are high quality and in particular high quality for the price point where they're competing then sure i think that they will find a market in america but to me it all comes back to quality and and the political point i think is interesting and worth thinking about i saw a separate uh study that basically suggested that a minority of americans expect to buy an ev for their next car over the next 5 years but if you looked in the data what was actually the most telling was um republicans were much more likely to say that they didn't think they'd buy an electric car uh people who were older were much less likely to say that they thought they would buy an electric car and so i think there are factors beyond you know just is it you know from china will people not want to buy it because it's from china quality matters and that matters too so we'll see well i wanted to quickly talk on that those data points yahoo finance report i forget who they worked with but it was basically half the people they surveyed don't know what the sample size was said that they would not want to buy or like strongly against or not want to buy an electric car the number really surprised me i didn't catch that nuance and it does uh surprise me that this trend over the last few years that all of a sudden electric car says something about where you are at politically i i kind of don't get it because i think it should just be a question about is is it a good car and is it uh do you enjoy it but here we are and as you said hyper political environment we hadn't talked about this our view on this and i am in agreement with you i think that eventually we're going to have chinese cars in the us in 1965 the thought of having japanese cars in the us would have been absurd and uh i think the same would have probably been true about some of the south korean manufacturers 1520 years ago at the end of the day i think us consumers want to get the most bang for their buck and if if byd is able to do that or jack is another manufacturer uh that potentially could be coming to the us uh i think that uh people will set aside some of their political indifferences or their political biases uh also i i think it's unlikely at least in the next five years that there's any five 10 years that there's any sort of manufacturing of chinese cars in the us i think that just probably would cut across both aisles people uh right now i just think the political environment wouldn't support that but import is something different we're coming up at uh i want to i want to interject one thing i know we're on a clock but i think this is a good tie-in uh liquid death this might seem odd when you think about what does something say about a consumer how important is that everything says something about a consumer everything they buy even if it's something cheap and no brand it says i bought something cheap with no brand i was reading a study about liquid death which is basically just spring water in a metal can that's the marketing pitch um the reason that it succeeded because most people saw it and they're like this is the dumbest idea i've ever seen you're buying you're paying more to just have water in a can but that's exactly the point it's a conversation starter is what this study was kind of talking about this person was talking about it said if you have a can of liquid death right instead of a beer what does that say about you well you don't drink that's that's a question why don't you drink why don't you have a beer why do you have a can of water that's odd and so the point is anytime we're thinking about products including cars being made in china if you buy a car that's made in china it does say something about you and as a consumer you're going to have to be willing to accept that aside from the quality factors and all these other factors you're going have to be willing to accept what that says about you i think that's an interesting marketing challenge for byd it's really an interesting challenge for any consumer product marketing company including every car company that will make evs over the next 10 years makes makes sense and gets us to our final topic here we do want to try to on a weekly basis hit something related to ai at deep water we believe that we're just scratching the surface at the potential we believe the sub of ai will ultimately uh comfortably exceed the hype in the years to come and there's going to be lots of ways to profit from that so we want to briefly touch on what's going on in the chip wars as a reminder that both google and amazon are building their own chips uh these chips are predominantly focused on their uh for uh their they product they're trying to build these chips and they would be used for like their data centers and for their own computing capacity but doug uh that's not where the story ends when it comes to big tech and ch chips microsoft is jumping into the chip game too they have a chip called athena that is rumored to come out uh at their coming developer conference and the bottom line is and this is kind of something that deep water we've been talking a lot about more recently our view is that if you are a real ai company and you have a market valuation over hundred billion doar i think you have to be building your own ships i actually think it's an imperative that you build your own ships not only does it divers ify you away from basically a single supplier right now which is nvidia nvidia has 85 90% market share for ai compute um but it also gives you the opportunity to build chips that are custom tuned to the applications that you are building and that can help you drive additional efficiency so microsoft's in amazon's in meta also is in google's in i think you'll probably see open ai do something there was a story that they were exploring this too and i wouldn't be surprised if you saw some other companies that are maybe not as deep into ai as as the ones we just listed but on the tertiary maybe an adobe maybe maybe a salesforce.com i think you might see companies like that think about it as well uh you threw out a a benchmark there you said a hundred million market cap billion dollar billion dollar uh market cap or greater there's probably what 50 companies that would fall into that category that potentially would it' make sense for them to build their own chips well i i i would caveat and say real ai companies over so like coca-cola you know they're they don't need to build their own chips but if you are a technology company and you are a real developing real unique proprietary ai technology i think you should be building your own ships makes a ton of sense the name of the show is deep tech 315 that's three topics in 15 minutes or less i'm checking the clock here brian's holding it up we're at 14 minutes we're going to call it a wrap at that on behalf of doug myself and deep waterer bye for now
DeepTech315: Nvidia / WWDC / Zoox,2024-06-06 21:22:55+00:00,15,KrJEfLkzz0c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJEfLkzz0c,"welcome to deep tech 315 this is where we talk about the three most important topics in tech for the week in less than 15 minutes i'm jee mster along with doug clinton and our three topics this week are tesla earnings netflix earnings and also why we are not in an ai bubble and we'll kick it off with the tesla earnings the shares are down call it 12% since when they just before they reported nasdaq's down about 3% during that time and the reason is was an ugly quarter and the outlook was ambiguous which understandably why shares are down the company's essentially entering into what i think is going to be a year of margin pressure and then on the opposite side of that i think things start to improve so let's focus in on what the the tp the key pressure point issue was here related to profitability and this is at the center point of the whole debate around tesla because is this a tech company or is is that a car maker it's all about profitability to put it in perspective is that at its peak tesla's gross margins excluding credits hit 29% that was about a year and a half ago and since then they've declined to 16.3% so investors were looking for around just under 18% but it came in at that 16.3% mark so that disappointment margins really shook the stock investors were hoping just after the numbers came out that they would say something optimistic about margin in the future on their earnings call instead they said they got a lot of pre-orders for cybertruck a million and as they start to ramp production of that that is also going to pressure margins so when you put this together the whole bull case on tesla is related to improving margins and this being a tech company and that just basically got stepped back a full year separately there was some reading between the lines that went on relative to their outlook on demand and uh there has been more talk about some of the slowdown in evs recently and case musk talked about the impact of interest rates but there is a question specifically on the call is how do they think about their 50% keger through 2030 related to deliveries and musk kind of uh scoffed at it kind of laughed at the idea that 50 you can't gret 50% into perpetuity because you'll have be greater than the size of the collective universe something like that but the funny part about him uh making fun of that is that that's a metric that he has thrown out in the past and so that 50% delivery growth compound growth metric gets you to about 20 million vehicles in 2030 if you adjust that to 30% growth it gets you to 85 million vehicles so that's a big step down that's the power of compounding and that's where the street is for next year basically 27% growth for vehicles and so that was the double whammy that hit tesla this week related to profitability and separate related to the outlook longer term i do believe that the world is going eventually to be electric all cars will be electric i think it's going to take longer than i initially thought and i continue to believe that tesla is in a great position to capitalize on that market gm recently talked about their orion plant which is going to be dedicated to building light trucks that opening or delaying it about a year and a half to the end of 2025 it feels like the broader automotive community is almost shifting back and embracing more to gas powered vehicles here and i think that that uh well maybe the current temperature i think that eventually the tide will shift back to electrification and i think tesla is going to be in a great place when they do that the 1 million cybertruck pre-orders probably half of them maybe um 75% of them are real so you got to factor that in but this is going to kind of set up for what should be uh some exciting uh movement in the story after we get through this next very tough year so that's tesla we're going to shift to another earnings that's netflix and they also had um a big stock move this time in the positive direction their shares up 177% after the day and a half after they had reported uh the nasdaq during that period has been down about 2% the big reason why is that they surprised on the subscriber ads they beat the estimate by 60% and separately they talked about a price increase but that's not where i want to start i want to bring doug in here and uh doug uh you and i and the deep waterer team in our daily meeting were talking about netflix a couple days before fill us in what the conversation was and why it's relevant to today we had some skepticism i'd say around netflix we were talking a little bit about this sort of new uh experiential concept that they're maybe experimenting with um and uh we're kind of wondering you know are they running out of ways to grow basically and uh i reminded the team actually that even though we don't own netflix in any of our core funds we do actually own netflix in a couple of ai powered funds that we are experimenting with um and so the machines got it right the humans got it wrong at least for one day with earnings we'll see what happens over the long term but we have been trying to use ai to see can you use ai generative ai to make intelligent investment decisions over the long run uh our belief at deep water is if you want to understand where the world is going you have to actually participate you have to be curious you have to experiment in that direction of the world and i don't think there's any more powerful direction in terms of where the world is going right now than ai i love that about you doug you're willing to go there roll up the sleeves try these different tools out try to apply it to us and maybe our jobs are eliminated in the future but i guess the good news is that at least we've got our our ai power machine sustains yeah yeah the machines will be there behind us can you tell us uh i know it's early but how's the performance been we're just a couple weeks in in our actual application in some some funds that we're running uh i do have some strategies that i've been tracking for about three months so kind of mid july we started exp experimenting with this and uh the main first strategy that i created it's beating its benchmark by almost 300 basis points right now it's beating the s&p 500 by about 40 so so far the machines have been doing pretty well love it that's going to be a fun one to continue to track we'll definitely report back on on deep tech 3155 on how that progresses and let's get back to kind of the fundamentals of netflix as you said we were skeptical going into it that this they've had difficulties in doing subscriber ads about a year or so ago they made some progress in the june quarter and then we have this kind of uh uptake the lever of related to pricing uh excuse me the lever related to the password crackdown is definitely working that's why they're beating those subn numbers then they also talk about a pricing increase uh this time it's a 9% price increase 18 months ago was a 7% price increase and this is kind of a similar time window that they typically do uh changes to priceing about every 15 to 18 months happen be 18 months in this case and so my my question goes beyond the levers they've pulled the password lever they've pulled the pricing lever again they've had this ad model that they're starting to uh increase the ad load's low on it today like 8% compared to typical linear tv which is like 35% so this is still early so they have some levers that they've pulled and will continue to pull but ultimately in the back of my mind i keep thinking about the creator economy and can you describe we talk a lot about it at deep water what is the crater economy and why is it relevant to the conversation with netflix and broader hollywood the creator economy is uh this broad ecosystem across the internet of creators people that have 10,000 followers 100,000 followers even a million followers and they really specialize in a specific topic so they become material experts in some specific niche and they build a following around it and what amazing about the internet is it is built for the longtail so if you want to find a really compelling creator for almost anything that you're interested in you can find that person online somewhere and they're probably creating some really amazing content um i think that you know this creator economy it's been an idea that's been percolating for more than a decade now i mean people uh that used to be professional youtube creators i think were looked down upon and now the average full-time youtube creator earns about $60,000 a year so it can be a real job a real legitimate job uh and i think that that's what we're kind of seeing when we think about the attention game you know that netflix is playing the professional content creators are playing they're playing it against these creators because time that we spend doing leisurely things consuming content um it all comes from the same bucket in the end of the day so they need to find ways netflix does to make sure they can keep uh creating compelling mainstream content content that competes with this more niche content on the creator economy it reminds me some comments from netflix a couple years ago talking about the impact of tik tok on their business and and this is the creator economy as well youtube at deep water we estimate that ours viewed on youtube now is four times what it is on netflix so this is it's definitely happening and my question is is uh ultimately how does let's say you're running netflix here and you see this uh uh the slowrising tide of of creator uh content um continuing to grab mind share for for for for content uh consumption what are you thinking or what move would you uh pursue i think to try to move creators to netflix would be a mistake because making creators mainstream almost sort of definitionally defeats the purpose of having that niche audience when you have hundreds and millions of subs like netflix you can't build a niche product that only serves 10,000 people it just doesn't make sense and so i would actually use another super successful creator uh mr beast as maybe the model that netflix needs to keep thinking about which is he goes on and he creates just epic amazing incredible youtube videos that millions of people do watch uh he's one of the biggest probably widespread creators in the world i think he made $80 million if i remember i think i said saw recently last year so he's incredibly successful i think that that model makes more sense for netflix so maybe trying to figure out ways can we incorporate maybe some of these semi mainstream personalities yeah and can we really invest in highquality content that our broad audience will really love and still be competitive alongside you know uh the content that they cre mr beast weekly kind of a maybe i mean i don't think you can just replicate what he's doing but i think that that model makes sense of the highest quality video you can possibly do and things that you know you can't find anywhere else that's what netflix needs to do oh sounds amazing and as you think about their other give me thumbs up thumbs down they do talk about other growth initiatives i think netflix is well aware that they've got to find other things beyond passwords and pricing and ad support of miles to grow their business longer term they talk about netflix house which is like a restaurant concept cep still not out of the gates yet they also talk about more live streaming content more gaming content what do you think about those three can you give me a u a a rating on one to 10 rating on each of them and we'll start with the uh netflix house the restaurant are you going to grab wings at how about this i i'll rank them i'll rank uh gaming and live streaming are really close one and two gaming live streaming and then netflix house is like you know uh three four meters below that probably it reminds me of like amazon getting into brick and mortar whether it's whole foods or some of their their go stores too and is that just the the pendulum is that we go offline with dvds to online and then we got to find growth so we go back to offline i like it's fun to kind of tease about it but i think it actually does make sense in a way for them to experiment with this experiential idea because what they're doing back to the idea of they're creating content hopefully if they're successful that you can't find anywhere else and you know that's fundamentally how they win and that content naturally should create worlds that people want to participate in and how do they do that well in the real world somehow you have to have some kind of experience where you bring people together and you extend these linear sort of experiences that you have with netflix into games into reality ultimately so i think it makes sense for them to figure it out i don't know that you know the restaurant is going to be the ultimate thing but hopefully they learn something from that that they can apply to maybe another idea makes sense i'm not doing a good job of keeping an eye on the clock here we got about three minutes so if we can jump into the all important topic of a question that doug you and i we get from the media frequently which is are we in an ai bubble no i don't believe we are i think we're in like 1996 uh versus the.com bubble and the.com bubble peaked in 2000 so gives you a sense that i think we're still really early if you really put it to the numbers nvidia trades at about 35 times forward earnings right now and at its peak which was just i think right at the end of 99 cisco traded at around a 100 times forward earnings so okay netflix is already up 200% this year to put that into perspective it had to be up another 200% from here to get to the cisco level of craziness and uh that same metric that same comparison is even crazier if you look at the broader nasdaq nasdaq currently is trading around 30 times the nasdaq in the bubble peak traded at 200 times and so that's a 6x from here on the nasdaq which again has been performing really well this year it's up almost 30 why do the why does the question even come up if we're in a bubble because we don't most of us don't remember the dot bubble and because nvidia's up a lot this year that's part of it i think the the move in the magnificent 7 is probably the biggest piece of it but i think it's also because we we are at the early stages we're at the very beginning we're at the froth period where things are starting to percolate um but we're not at this insanity level i think when people say we're in a bubble it implies that we're in this totally insane crazy period where something's going to pop in the immediate term i don't think we're anywhere close to that um and i think that when you really think about the possibilities of ai it's probably more profound than the internet and so you could even make an argument we could get even crazier than what happened with the internet from here is we we think about the work we've done for a long time together it's always been kind of ground up fundamental identifying where the world's going and the companies that are going to benefit from that then we we're talking here about a bubble and this idea of maybe uh came to mind of trading you trade you buy a a basket of companies that potentially could get caught up in a bubble and own those for the next couple years call it a two-year trade how do you think about that balance between the fundamental piece uh but also maybe anticipating and wanting to benefit from a bubble that could be on the horizon f i was we were talking uh the analyst team and i a little earlier about this exact topic and i think the answer is you always want to ground yourself in owning really great fundamental companies um you should never own never buy a company just because you think it's going to get a big from a bubble that's just so unpredictable own great companies that not only do you think can have a great business with or without the bubble but have the potential that if a bubble happens they get a real insane bid i think that's the best way to try to play anything like that if you do want to touch on the bubble theme and then the key to playing that game is when you do get to the insanity level when you get the cisco at 100 times earnings and the nasdaq at 200 times you do have to sell because you don't want to ride it all the way up and then ride it down 70% you've done nothing you're basically in in the same place you started maybe even worse right that's the hard discipline because the way the bubbles play out the way i remember it it's like things get crazy and you say they can't get any more crazy and then they get more crazy and then you say well it shouldn't have gotten crazier before now it's getting more crazy therefore this should keep going on forever maybe that's the checkpoint of that second of that second level of craziness is when you think about pairing back here and even the hardest part of of the whole thing is even if you get it right sensing the craziness right we still think ai is real so let's say we get a bubble let's say we get a burst eventually you have to buy back in and that's harder than selling at the top because then everybody just lost 70% mhm yeah i could see a couple opportunities to to create wealth around this makes a ton of sense that's all the time we got today for deep tech 315 on behalf of doug jean and deep water bye for now"
Pressure Points: WWDC,2024-06-10 23:37:06+00:00,9,01KK00lhDOY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01KK00lhDOY,"welcome to deep tech 315 that's doug i am jean our three topics this week our first apple's vision pro hits the shelves second is hearing a little bit about an ai bubble coming powered by tsmc and last we're going to talk about apple trying to dodge some of the impact related to steering so we'll take it to a top doug it's rare that we get apple announcing a whole new product category today is the day uh vision pro went on sale this morning i went on uh was right there when the uh orders began and got through the process in about 10 minutes and after i had this like sinking feeling in my stomach i just spent $3,800 on a device that's going to have pretty limited utility over what i think is the foreseeable future the next one to three years and as i think about when develop ers are going to get behind this it's probably going to take that much time and this is really going to be about developers and early tech enthusiasts probably over the foreseeable future i agree with that and i think just like we saw with the iphone in some cases when you put that and open it up in the hands of uh sort of the infinite creativity that you get from the developer community some magical things can happen my objection with the vision pro is not that it's not going to be an awesome device i'm sure the experience is going to be incredible it's been just that there's not a killer use case i i think that's the other thing that is different this time with the iphone you had the internet in your pocket you had a phone connected to that right you had email rich email and you also had songs you had you get rid of your ipod basically which was that mattered back then now use cases or the utility of the iphone was immediate or here it's great technology for sure the best uh a wearable technology but still struggling is this a technology looking for a problem is my question i think it probably is right now and to your point about developers i mean that will ultimately tell the tale probably if if developers come up with some killer use case that people get super excited about that will make the device a success but i think we should go into it realizing that it feels like it's a device looking for a problem it's awesome tech technology apple doesn't put anything out that isn't amazing it's going to be amazing but uh is there something that we are doing with this device that we can do with this device that we can't do with any other device that we also can't live without i'm not sure yet and i mentioned that this is the year where uh it's going to be developers and tech enthusiasts i'd put you and i definitely in the tech enthusiast category we're also tech investers and we're open to investing in developers who are building applications on top of this this and so it's important for deep water to have uh vision pro for us to experiment with this and to understand how the tech is playing out and so uh very curious uh to meet those developers in the years to come and and see how that plays out and i suspect this is also going to be the year where many will say that the product is dead on arrival that meta their initiatives around quest have been have largely failed i think they've sold six or eight million units over the first five six years and i think that uh you know we're taking an approach of just we're just having an open mind on this and uh you know let's see where it goes i'm excited to try the product in more detail but also in very measured in terms of how i think that uh you know what the trajectory how this plays out ultimately i think that there is a drift towards consumers and immersion immersive tech and i think that apple's going to is committed to seeing this through and so i think they get there may take a decade but i think they're going to get there i think this is a product that eventually could be 15% of revenue we'll see how that plays out but i just want to emphasize that this is a year two years three years where there's going to be i think understandable some critics of the device uh also interesting to note that as of recording here that uh the nasdaq futures are up about 7% shares of apple are up about. 2% uh the lead times have been kind of extending out but of course that's because of low supply um i don't think it's because of a huge demand uh this year we're thinking 500,000 or less units and so um we're going to report back as we get our hands on this and um if you if there are any developers out there who are listening we' love to hear what you're building so we're going to shift to our second topic which is ai douger on cnbc this week and talking about an ai bubble and tsmc and before uh you kind of uh recap your thoughts on that i just want to give people a brief introduction to tsmc for those who don't know this is of course taiwan semi it's a 570 billion us dollar market cap company and they of course make the most advanced chips over the past year the stock is up call it 24% the nasdaq is up around 37% there is a a lagger effect relative to the geopolitical environment in china and taiwan of course and so but um you know you've been great at kind of uh foreseeing this this bubble that's coming that's really exciting well you can't say that you're great at for seeing yet until it actually happens so i will amend that comment uh but i am going to keep banging the table because i do think it's going to happen uh my logic has been simple but to just go through it quickly you look through history you look back at other technologically driven bubbles like the internet like the pc electricity railroads the list goes on they all have the same fundamental structure which is there's some early innovation people start to get excited their imagins run imaginations run wild capital starts to chase all those things and eventually too much capital chases every single good and bad idea that is going after the bubble in my view that's actually a necessary component of creating breakthrough technologies is you actually have to have an excess of capital to basically guarantee that whatever the technology is every idea gets tried and it gets the greatest chance of actually breaking out i don't think we have an excess of capital in ai right now not yet and we don't have mania in ai if you look at some of the multiples of public companies most of the mag s trades it call it between 20 and 35 or 40 times next year's earnings that's not bubble territory cisco was 100 in 2000 so we're still early yeah definitely not there yet what's the breaking point the breakout point from being a a theme that people are behind and investors generally embrace to this euphoria is it is there is there some kind of dna around that breakout point that every time people turn around there's a company beating numbers because of ai or it's it's all over the press today and so it's uh you turn around you always see ai but do do you have an idea of what that kind of turning point is going to be in the next three to five years i don't think it's something that's quantitative i think it's very qualitative it's going to be a thing where you just have to have a feel for what's going on in the world and i think you get that feel from observing what these companies are building observing how investors are thinking about deploying capital into these companies and then also just observing the conversation how people are talking about these technologies um and so for me again kind of tracking all of these things you put all those uh qualitative factors together it still feels super early i mean we talk about 100 million people right weekly i think use chat gpt billions of people are on the internet i mean just to put the scale in sense i mean ch chat pt is a baby right now and those 100 million people a lot of them are just messing around doing you know nothing meaningful with it there's probably a couple million people that are doing anything really meaningful with ai right now who aren't building it themselves right like think about how much more that has to change because itially billions of people are going to be using it just like the internet from from my perspective i'm on board with this upcoming bubble because i just see this is close to electricity and i think that something that's that profound of a change eventually is going to create that euphoria and so lines up in the same place maybe slightly different path on how we get there but we're definitely on the same page there and a company around this that a lot of people don't know as well is tsmc tsmc reported on wednesday night uh so they had pretty solid earnings and the stock was up i think almost 10% yesterday uh proudly we own it um in a couple of our strategies our hybrid strategy that invests in public and private companies it's really going after the ai theme the thing about tsm is it's a$ 500 billion dollar market cap company people maybe have heard the name but if you think about this idea of an everyone company this is something i've written about before and i think talked about here before companies that build products that literally everybody in the world uses tsm is probably the most under the radar everyone company of all because if you if you just sit here i mean i'm sitting in front of a couple cameras a monitor a few pcs an ipad an iphone all those products have a handful of tsmc chips in them so i might have 100 tsm chips in my house alone um and think about that across the scale of the world you know everybody even if they just have a regular cell phone right that they're still probably using tsm chips in some way so that's that's the company where you think about how is ai compute going to evolve who's going to win nvidia amd somebody else it doesn't matter because they all have to use tsm that's sort of the bet that we've made is all roads lead to them in terms of ai compute and they should win as a result and one of the reasons why we feel good about that is that it's it's just really hard to build these advanced chips uh they also said on their earnings call that their next generation which is the two nimet two nodes is uh they're at three right now the orders that they have for that exceeds where they were at the same period for the uh the three n nanometer so i think that u it's just a really hard thing to do easy to say i make chips very hard to do tsmc does a great job of it so we're going to jump to our last topic which is the cat mouse game between uh i don't know if it's the courts in apple or regulation or steering in general but of course the supreme court this week decided not to hear the appeals from apple and epic related to this 2021 trial that went on apple won nine out of 10 cases the one case that they lost was related to steering so this means that apple has to allow app developers to be able to insert uh will allow them to insert links into their apps that are downloaded through and discovered on the apple's app store and that allows them to transact directly with the customer basically avoid the pay wall and apple shortly after that came out uh was issued some changes to the terms of conditions for developers and the app store that basically say that they have to pay a 27% uh tax if they transact off a platform it's on the honor system so the developer has to submit if they uh close a customer customer that they app was downloaded on the app store if they close that customer outside and apple has the ability to audit app developers to make sure that they're uh reimbursing apple and uh you know this was a surprise move for me i had gone through and done the numbers and expected that this was about a 4% hit to apple's earnings uh i'm going to publish on that or all that math comes from but it was a measurable hit to earnings having some of these developers move in a different direction and i think the real question here is you know what is the what's the proper number that you know apple should be compensated something but how do how do we figure out what the proper number is uh that they should be compensated for for having this app store i think the only way you ever figure out proper numbers for compensation is through uh in this case probably t negotiation see where the market's at i mean apple has gone out and basically set a price and said it's 30% % take it or leave it um and these developers and i think rightfully like i think 30% feels like a lot this is how i've always framed it if you're epic or if you're match.com or spotify or netflix you spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on marketing driving consumers to go download these apps and i do think that they should get recognized for the reality that they do spend a lot on marketing um they're not just wholly reliant on apple to show people that there is a netflix app there's a match.com app whatever it may be um so it just feels like 30% and their actions are saying hey we feel like 30% is too much i don't know what the right number is and and any we could go and we could throw out any number we want 10% 20% 5 perc i don't know but the only way to figure out something that is quote unquote fair i think is to have the two parties get together uh and figure out you know what is what is acceptable on both sides meet somewhere in the middle that makes nobody happy but you move forward i think what's gonna i think the free market you think you mentioned something about the free market i agree with that and i think that part of these negotiations are just going to naturally play themselves out is that if apple is able to i'm not sure what the legality of them charging uh for app developers outside of the store feels like they're kind of just circumventing what the ruling was but let's say that that does stand eventually the market is the developers will just figure it out they'll they'll say no this isn't worth it for me we're going to pull our apps from apple app store and or that they will pay for it to me it just feels like the natural outcome here is just the freehand of the market will decide what the pricing is well they have no lever though i don't i disagree with that apple and that's why it's gone to antitrust is because they're arguing that apple's not allowing a free market process to occur there is no negotiation right there is no appeal to say 30% is too much take it or leave it uh they've tried these mechanisms right epic pick his tried mechanisms netflix has used steering for a long time sorry you can't sign up for a subscription on your iphone please go to our website um so they've tried these workarounds that is the free market and now apple's kind of crushing those right they're crushing the one thing developers were doing couldn't the free market just be for these app developers to say i don't want to use apple's uh app store isn't that one way say that yeah they they could say that but i think that then you get into a question of what's good for the customer because at some point the app developer can just say well if i have to pay 30% i'm going to have to charge my customers more because i still need to make a margin right and i think that's what gets ignored in this case when we get into what's fair who who's going to eat the 30% there's three options right apple the customer or the developer that's what it comes down to and at some level each of the three you think about the 30% needs to have some responsibility for rectifying that it shouldn't be all the developers and i think that's sort of how they feel right now because netflix doesn't raise its prices on the iphone if you sign up there it's the same as if you sign up on the web same as if you sign up on your mac so maybe maybe that's what the free market is is to say hey look you know if you want to sign up on an apple device we we totally support you but you're going to have to pay 30% more than if you just sign up on your ma makes sense if uh they want to continue to be a part of the app store and my thought is if again if if they don't like it just uh no one's forcing them to sell on the app store they can just take their business someplace else but that's i don't think this case is over i'll just i'll leave it there i think there's still something that doesn't feel fair certainly from the developer standpoint and i think they'll keep fighting oh yeah you want want to see somebody blowing a gasket tim sweeney from epic look at his tweets after all of this too so it it ain't over that's for sure and uh but this episode is uh a wrap on of doug jean and deep water bye for now"
DeepTech315: WWDC / AAPL / Elon's Pay Package,2024-06-14 18:24:47+00:00,15,Tzxl83LiCCU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzxl83LiCCU,"welcome to deep tech 315 i'm jean mster along with doug clinton this is when we talk about the three most important topics in tech this week for 15 minutes or less and our three topics are the earnings related to google and microsoft and specifically what's going on in the cloud race and why that's important second we'll discuss meta results and last talk about some changing tides in how traditional automakers are approaching the ev opport and so we'll bring it back to the top dog we have microsoft google both reporting on the same night both telling two slightly different stories related to the pressure points on that that would have been their cloud business azure saw a step up in their growth rate from 26% in the june quarter to 29% in september well we had google showing a dell from call it 28% in june down to 23 actually missing street estimates which we're looking for 25% growth so when you put all that together and mix it up uh what was your reaction as you were uh thinking about those two that dynamic uh the selloff for google i mean almost 10% in a single day i think tells you more about where the market's at versus really the numbers i mean cloud it is an important part of google's long-term story but it's still a really small part of the overall story i mean search far and way is the most important part of their business that part of the business was fine cloud was weak separate that from the stock reaction which felt aggressive given that reality yeah this is the tail wagon the dog in this case i think it is a little bit but i think it also speaks to to another reality which is it feels like microsoft has set itself up really well to be kind of the dominant cloud provider for ai and if you look across what the big aiy companies are sort of doing in terms of uh partnerships with these cloud providers obviously anthropic just had a big partnership with aws a few weeks ago which also tied some funding to that open ai has been long tied to microsoft hugging face has a partnership with microsoft inflection has a partnership with microsoft and so a lot of the big players have gone toward azure and not as many have chosen gcp and i think that's that's maybe a little bit uh of the backstory behind the reaction to the numbers so but there's this huge emphasis that we're putting on these cloud numbers and uh for perspective azure's business is more than twice the size of google's cloud business their profitability is off the charts it's like 40% google cloud's at a 3% margin so these are are are there's different scales of the business but my sense is the reason why this is so important and the reason why the tails wagging google as the dog is because this seems to be like the the the cutting edge for investors is how they're thinking about who has the lead in ai and it's almost like all the good things that are going on with search and what the potential could go on with search with ai is forgotten because they're losing the race in cloud and uh do you think that's kind of the the dynamic that we're seeing i think google just needs to show a little more with ai i think i think year to date and i'm like we own the stock it's one of our biggest positions year to date uh the story has kind of shifted did and now it's shifting back so at the beginning of the year uh microsoft was outperforming google i think the narrative was open ai is sort of running away with the ai race i feel like that narrative softened a little bit over the summer google launched bar they started to build some more ai into their products they launched a phone that has some cool ai features um and now it feels like that narrative is resurfacing again is google still a real player in ai are they really at danger to losing um kind of the golden goose with search to chat interfaces and that question still feels uh unanswered one of the i think disappointing things about the call uh too was it felt like there was a little bit of a maybe hesitancy in terms of giving a timeline on when gemini google's next generation ai model will come out it was supposed to be in q4 now it maybe seems like that's not so certain yeah it may end up being q4 but not so certain as we have been thinking about this too and we debated like are we on the right side of this uh this trade if you will between microsoft and google and in the sense that microsoft has more momentum here but i feel like google hasn't even really started to show what they can do in ai especially around search and i i think that um i think ultimately that this i understand the topic is focused on these cloud numbers but my take is for google investors just to take a deep breath present company included and to look at the the breadth of what they've been investing in ai we haven't seen it yet but i think over the next year we're going to see some of those benefits and uh love your take on that too i'm still very optimistic about google still optimistic i think they still have an underrated asset which is so much data on consumer preferences and consumer behavior no company in the world knows more about how consumers think about uh buying things than google i mean literally billions of times a day people go to google a search engine they tell them what they want that data should ultimately help power really great experiences uh that use ai we just haven't seen it yet and so i think we just we kind of just need to see something more tangible i still have optimism around gemini for that be curious if you and i are on the same page on this view is that i think this is a similar transition that we saw from desktop to mobile is that when that happened with google they did see a dip down in their search growth coming from the mid 20% down to 10% there was some macro things going on at the same time but it their search growth did decline do you think the shift to ai is kind of a similar type of a a shift a step function as we saw on desktop that's not my baseline bet no because i think that a lot of the ai use cases are uh different we kind of map these out you can kind of think of them in different ways but a lot of the ai use cases that i think are really compelling are actually different like if you're asking who was the president of the united states in 1825 right like google can answer that or chat gbt can answer that who cares the the reality is it's about the same experience either way that doesn't matter but i think when you're still searching for products that lends itself to search a little more when you're looking for ai to help create something that lends itself to ai search does doesn't do that that's not a core use case and so i think you have to consider those use cases as you think about what could the headwind be to search well we are expecting a headwind and we think that ultimately they will come back on right side of that equation which uh speaking of headwinds uh our second topic here is meta the stock also down on the print and it was up after they gave guidance it was up going into the earnings call and then lookout uh cfo susan lee mentions some economic uh the the geopolitical uh things that going in the middle east and how that's have a softening impact on month to date the first month of the quarter and shares quickly started to trade down trade down about 6% quickly right thereafter and the thing that surprised me is that guidance was uh including i would guess that guidance that they gave which for december was depending on the number numbers you're looking at a percent 2% higher than where the street was at that guidance factored in this slow start to the quarter that she mentioned because the geopolitical so from my view it was like actually they everything was fine they probably would have guided higher if not for what was going on with the geopolitical and uh what's your take on that you saw the same thing happen to snap and it's always always funny to reference snap relative to meta given how much they had same commentary about geopolitical didn't they same com and the same stock reaction i think uh snap was actually up almost 20% at one point and sort of i think ended up close to the flatter down maybe a little bit uh after earnings but similar commentary you know i think that uh the bottom line is the market the way the market is thinking about the world is if there is some hesitancy from a company if there's any sort of indication that q4 is looking a little bit sketchy a little bit soft soft maybe i think they're putting more weight into that commentary than maybe around the actual guidance itself to your point which was above the street and fear rules right now just look at what the market's been doing all week i mean that's it it's got to be pristine for investors to be okay with a quarter at this point it does yeah and and i think aside from what meta said on the call and kind of the q&a about uh some of the maybe potential softness i thought some of the product things they talked about still left me with some more optimism i i felt all year basically since last year i mean we're we've kind of annualized now the facebook trough of last october where everybody thought marcus urberg was done and he was spending like a drunken sailor on on yeah reality labs and now look where we are stocks up 3x from there i think some of the products though that we're seeing them put out the the ray bang glasses no they're not as uh impact as as classes but i think that you know they're pushing things like that llama has had 30 million downloads last month they said it's the most used open- source ai model in the world right now and so they're innovating on all fronts and i think this year of efficiency has also been a year of innovation for meta so we also own meta at deep water and i can say that after google there was kind of more questions and answers we're still there we're still positive on it with meta i actually felt better about the business overall in part because the daus continue to crank up it just blows me away one in four people globally visit a meta property daily and they're going to build some of these interactive or more engaging more entertainment ai type of application so that gets me excited uh and i just think i don't use these products but i think from u perspective of continuing to drive engagement i think they're they they're going to uh they really have something here before we go on to our final topic i did want to ask on the reality labs piece so they're going to be spending about 15 billion a year apple spends about 30 billion in total on r&d and from my perspective it makes sense for them to be invest in this i believe in the metaverse i believe in spatial computing call what you want but they got to dial that back and what's your take on that they have already to some degree all right i mean from last year um it does feel it's accelerating the amount that they're spending is accelerating it does still feel a lot i think that they're still of zuckerberg's mindset there's there's a big bet for them to make there you know i think it's not just about glasses it's about building world it's about building the metaverse concept that that sort of has faded away they renamed the company remember a year and a half ago or two years ago now um and so i think they still see a really big opportunity there to be a platform provider hardware and software and really digital services a world um i'm not saying that i think they should spend 15 billion a year but they need to invest if they want to bring it to reality if if you're zuckerberg and you want to seat at the table of what this next thing is whether it's spatial computing or the metaverse they're doing 15 billion is what they're expected to spend on reality labs what what do you think is the right number my number is five i think i think they should be spending five billion a year on this it's probably more than five you know somewhere between five and 15 is probably fair though i mean i think again it's if you think that it is the next computing platform you could actually make an argument that there's no number there's no amount that you you shouldn't fair by the way i am on that i'm on that that uh that well then your number should be higher than five my number should be higher than five you're right i'm i'm i'm beating them up for it but i'm also the big bull at deep water when it comes to spatial computing and uh the metaverse so uh good point uh touche and that's going to get us to our last topic here which is just related to uh some of the the automotive companies gm reported this week there's been more talk about just automotive more broadly i would say slowing some of their ambitions in ev and specifically gm is uh talking about slowing the roll out of their orion light truck factory that was supposed to be up and running kind of early 24 it's going to be late 25 they also have uh these issues with crews not just from a regulatory piece but they're losing a lot of money with crw and kind of trying to get that moving forward gm and honda this week announced that they're i think pausing an initiative for electrification i still couldn't name one electric honda car and uh i think uh there's the question about also like the current demand around evs and i want to just not uh address that if if if you're okay with that just don't talk about the current demand environment and more just talk about the trajectory here and i would love your take i know we're we've been on slightly different pages on this the conversation about what's the right pace to be investing in evs my view is let's just these these car companies need to be all in on this because if you're not all in you're basically eventually going to fall behind because eventually you got to make that transition and you've had a more nuanced view and i'd be curious how that has as you kind of thought about the news this week how that uh kind of lines up with the views that you have about uh the pace that traditional auto should pursue ev well i think you have to include the demand environment in that calculus because that's what they're doing i think that in large part a lot of this is them reacting to some of the real demand challenges that they're seeing i think the average ev right now costs $10,000 more at msrp than the average a gas car so there's a big difference you're paying a premium for evs right now if that's the way you want to go um and i think that one of the comments if you read kind of what gm said they talked about uh rtim i believe was the word that they used in terms of some of their capex spend around evs they're not giving up but i think they're saying hey maybe we don't see a path to doing as much volume as we thought here immediately and we do have to think about our budget we still do have a very large ice based business and we have to retime that so me as i i always like to brand myself as the rational optimist i think evs are the future to be clear i think it's going to take longer than ev bulls think it will take for evs to overtake the market and i think that that's kind of what you're seeing the traditional automakers react to if if uh we're we're both on the same page that evs are the inevitable end point whether it's 200 years from now or 10 years from now whatever that point is and i've been too optimistic in terms of how fast this is going to roll out so i need to adjust my my my timelines my question is if are we kind of is this like uh what was outer wall what was that red box like you you have to eventually make that shift and are they are they doing it just by kind of like you think about the honda piece kind of pulling back or what's going on with cruz or the delay of the the factory by a year and a half are you ultimately just still keeping alive of manufacturing process that you're not going to need in the future and eventually you got to bite the bullet and move off so why not move faster your your point is well the demand environment is not that great right now maret ready for it go a little bit slower and you can kind of milk your your the the gas cow the internal combustion engine cow and then until you really need to start to feed this other thing yeah and i think it's the wrong perspective to think it's only about what the oems are doing it's also about what the market wants i mean we referenced this survey the yahoo survey uh that came out a couple weeks ago with ipsos more than half of americans said they don't expect their next car to be an ev i mean there's still a lot of demand for gas cars as much as we all think that gas cars are terrible that you have to you have to pay attention to the market and what the market's asking for and so i do think that that should factor into the calculus and how aggressively they make these moves more than half doesn't want an ev but half is open to it and 9% of them buy evs every year like you can view that data just as easily positive for evs as negative you could but i think that if those half some of them are going to decide they don't want evs some will decide that they do and i think that the market is sort of meeting them where they're at right like i don't think there's a lot of people out there who say man i couldn't get my hands on the ev i wanted that's not a problem right now i do want to read the quote from the ceo of gm from their call uh regarding demand he said i want to emphasize that our ev momentum uh is building slowing ev demand growth is something that everyone's been talking about we've seen it in competitor earnings profiles but i want to be clear we're not seeing it in our portfolio right now admittedly off of lower volumes i wonder is this whole slowdown in evs really just about tesla slowing down it could be it could partially be that and again it's i think like retail and the internet i always like to use that as one of the analogies for how do markets kind of evolve over over time the internet took forever to get to 5% market share of commerce and 10% and now we're over 20% and it's been 25 years i don't necessarily think that eeds are going to go that slowly but remember we're talking about something where people are comfortable with gas vehicles they understand gas vehicles some people actually want gas vehicles and so to think that we're going to have like this inflection where all of a sudden it's just everybody's on evs i just don't think that's realistic i do think it's the future but it's just going to take a really long time my point is that i don't know when the inflection is but if you're a traditional automaker you better start moving there faster then i think my view is they just got to get moving there faster and you're take it sounds like is they're eventually going to get there but keep keep the profit kind of thing going be sensitive to the overall market yeah like tesla's going to win i've never said tesla's not going to win i've i've had other debates about tesla but tesla has already won the ev game i think the auto oems know that it doesn't mean they can't play walmart is still a relevant player in e-commerce so is target and so i think you have to think about the world in that context right tesla's amazon they're going to win this battle they're going to be the biggest player i think that's a fact it's hard to see that changing but i think it's still up for grabs who's going to be walmart who's going to be target who's going to be some of these other retailers that are big and relevant and still have other businesses actually aside from the new big thing and i got a belief that there's going to be some big autos that are going to be the next nokia so uh funny this one's going to the gift that keeps giving because we're a long way away from getting clarity about what the slope of that adoption curve is and uh speaking of slopes and adoption and uh trying to angle towards something i just blew right through our 15 this might be deep tech 320 today either way a lot of fun and on behalf of doug jean bye for now"
Pressure Points: Micron 3Q'24 Earnings,2024-06-26 22:19:34+00:00,6,8Noos2Mfdcg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Noos2Mfdcg,"welcome to this week's episode of deep tech 315 that's doug i'm jean our three topics this week is first image generation generators gone arai when it comes to ai now microsoft joins that fry second is we're going to talk about rivan some announcements related to cost cutting and a new model and how that changes the competitive landscape and last perplexity this is the google search competitor that's gaining traction in the startup space so we'll take it to the top a little bit of deja vu here uh this week we had a uh call it kind of a whistleblower somebody who has worked on some of the testing and redlining related to co-pilot designer this is basically dolly's version uh that's kind of branded under co-pilot microsoft but it went off the rails in the sense that it was more aggressive than i think most people wanted if you' put in uh um prompts for example teenager with gun it would show things that that it shouldn't show or maybe sexually explicit content and it kind of went off the rails and once this whistle had been blown they contacted cnbc and different regulatory bodies microsoft quickly uh clamped that down and so you couldn't do those types of prompts but it reminded me of a conversation we had two weeks ago related to what happened with google and some of their image generator gone arai and just put it in a context what what's going on here with ai and these image generator it seems like google maybe had some rails on its image generation technology with gemini that were uh inappropriately restrictive they were trying to force uh too much inclusion and maybe uh have gemini be too um unopinionated even on things where it should have a pretty clear opinion um and so i think that's one end of the spectrum the real on from gemini's perspective they just got the reain in tight so tight that it pops out the these crazy respons denied truth basically like the rails were be so unoffensive and be so politically correct that you would actually lie that's how extreme those rails were and i think with microsoft the counterargument might be well here's what might happen if the rails are a little too loose um the thing i think is different though is that with google and you see the tight rails the obvious denial of truth when we trust machines to tell us the truth now more than ever i think that's really dangerous the reality is you know these images we're talking about microsoft are they offensive to some people yes um are they things that are probably in the training data for open ai because they are images that can be found on the web also yes so there's not really a denial of truth going on on the microsoft case it's more of a question of how lenient should we be and how open should we be to some of the stuff that these ais present to us and i would actually argue that should be a choice that's made by the end user in conjunction with open ai you know like don't just all the control to open ai in microsoft let the user say what they want to make makes sense and so even though these two events kind of get mixed together they're really two totally different things that are going on here and in that second case that opportunity would it be you kind of envision like a a meter a level where you could say how conservative you want it to be how aggressive you want the model to to uh display results i think that is what it should evolve to eventually i've always thought that that is uh or should be part of the solution with social media too we think about what content do i want to be exposed to and what content would other people want to be exposed to those limits just might be different and i think that too often we try to create like this universal platform this universal rule for what everybody should be acceptably exposed to to and i don't think that that's a real thing i mean like in the movies we have different ratings and some people might not want to watch rated r movies and that's totally fine but that's their decision they understand what the rating says and they'll say i'll avoid that but some people do want to watch those kinds of movies and that's their choice and so i think choice is something we haven't talked enough about in my opinion as part of this llm revolution great point i like that idea i would be a user of the the dial and i guess it's uh in the hands of these companies to start to implement it i wonder that what that means for what does all this mean ultimately for xai in the sense that elon has been clear that he really wants that model to be true seeking well can i say though for xai or or grock the bot there it's the only one that actually has fun mode right like you can if you go in and you use it if you've used it they basically have like normal mode or basic mode where it's going to act like any other uh chat bot that you probably use for ai and they also have fun mode which you can like ask it to grill you or roast you and it'll pull a bunch of your tweets up and just make fun of you and so awesome that's i think an example of maybe where the world could go is it'll probably evolve way beyond fun mode but give the ai a little bit of direction about what kinds of things you're okay with and what kinds of things you're not okay with and i think it'll offer a better experience to everybody makes sense shifting gears to our second time topic which is shares arivan after getting pummeled a couple weeks ago on their december earnings where they guided down deliveries from the street was right around mid 70,000 75,000 to basically flat year-over-year at about 55,000 they had news today that they're going to be stopping plans for a new factory in georgia that's going to save them just over2 billion dollar a year and then separately they announced a new model that's going to come out the r3 i'll break down both of those quickly i think most of the the 133% move higher in rivan shares on the news today was probably related to the factory shutdown and the reason is that one of the reasons why the stock had such a big selloff was that there is this question about are they going to need to raise capital and the company's response has been that they are open to navigating the capital markets to navigate their financial needs and so that basically is code for they got to raise capital which no investor likes to own a stock when a company potentially has to raise capital in front of it and so this alleviated some of that tension you got some of the move higher and then separately is this r3 and just a quick recap here is the r2 has been anticipated for a long time this is their lower priced version but it's they finally gave the pricing today it's going to be out in 2026 for $45,000 starting point and i will uh start that i'll put my stake in the ground that even though that's their stated starting uh price i think it's probably going to be 50k and probably an average price of 55k at the end of the day so they're not going to hit that price point and then the r3 this is the one that's going to be out in 2027 they didn't give a time frame but likely out in 2027 also did not give a price but it's kind of speculated that this is going to come out somewhere between 35 and $45,000 it's caron driver made that estimate my sense is that this probably comes out closer to 40,000 and so when you put all this together there's a question of rivan how sustainable they're going to be and i think that this uh saving money is a good piece for it but i don't think that the r3 is going to somehow change the competitive landscape uh talked to other people in the industry today and one made a comment that this is going to be the model y killer or the jeep killer model y killer this is tesla's first real competition this r3 and i don't buy it and one of the reasons why is that they just simply don't have the scale to compete when it comes to price and range and some of the fit and finish they're going to do as i said about 55,000 vehicles this year fast forward that to 2027 maybe it's 80 90,000 vehicles maybe a 100 but by 2027 tesla's going to be doing two and a half three million vehicles a year and i think that uh that that gap really is going to make it tough for them to to kind of close the gap make any sort of progress against tesla and don't forget of course tesla's coming out with their lower priced supposedly 25 $330,000 vehicle next year so doug you've been right on rivan for the past year plus and would' be curious what your reaction to all this is like you said it is really really hard to compete on price unless you're just absolutely willing to eat margin and that's already but what rivan has been doing i think sort of life to dat and uh losing $40,000 on each vehicle that's right it's hard and and they i think the market has signaled to them that it's not willing to continue to accept those kinds of negative gross margins and so like you said i don't know how you get to positive gross margins when you're cutting the cost or trying to reduce the cost for a lower cost vehicle uh like that without scale so it's gonna be really hard and it reminds me actually if you rewind back to 2006 elon put out a master plan for tesla i mean this was in the very early days and he explained that the reason they were starting with a roadster for tesla was because they had to sell a high cost vehicle because otherwise you would just be in this negative margin territory and so you know it's not rocket science like the model has kind of been proven out before you kind of want to stay at the high end until you can get scale which obviously elon has done at tesla and that was what his master plan was you start with the roadster you bring out the model s then you get the lower cost cross vehicle and you just keep building on that uh that train and and i think rivan would probably be smart to maybe take a look at that master plan and rivan never got that scale at the highend to afford them this opportunity to kind of go lower no i mean it's impressive that they sold you more than 50,000 vehicles for sure you have to give them some credit for that but but i agree with you i don't think that that is enough scale to buy them the right to uh now try to do something at almost half the cost of that high-end vehicle yep and that right being of course the right in the eyes of the investor uh let's wrap with our third topic which is perplexity for those of you who don't know this this is an ai will still call them a startup they raised a lot of money uh they raised $74 million a couple months ago at around just over $500 million valuation uh now they've raised some additional money two months later uh this is again related to some search ai related search so 500 million valuation private valuation a couple months ago now it's uh unicorn so we're at a billion if you're curious how nvidia stock has done over that same time period those same two months if you want to guess doug what nvidia stock has done i think it's up about 80% so it's pretty close you're very good guess 93 by my mark and so i count that as a correct answer and uh you know what when i see this and think of perplexity i think about what was it duck duck go yeah they're still around they's still uh the uh the person who doesn't like actually i was reading a story about them i i don't remember the exact numbers but i mean it's a real business it's actually probably a pretty good business if you owned it you'd be really happy with your life um so they probably get some scorn because yeah it's like oh they're definitely not google obviously but i think they have carved out kind of kind of a niche for people who are maybe a little fed up with google yeah by the way you can in like iphone you can set your default search setting to uh google bing and i think duck duck goes still in there but um so is is this how is perplexity different than some of these other there's always been these kind of rifle shots on the side against google how how is this one different it starts with ai first i mean i think that is really the answer they're they're trying to as i understand understand it sort of build their own index of the web and then be able to give contextual answers to any question you might ask um so i think it's different because it's coming through the lens of doing it through ai not a direct you know hey let's just build another search engine like a duck ducko or bing um what i think is actually interesting though aside from this or parallel to this is uh i don't know how much you use google uh as a power user i do use it frequently i also use perplexity a lot um what i've noticed over the last two or three weeks is that the number of search generative responses that i'm getting google's ai generated responses is up probably like the nvidia stock chart you just talked about i'm getting them on a lot of my queries now so we've criticized google in the past as shareholders in our core titan fund that they haven't been moving fast enough but i will have to give them some credit that it does feel like more recently at least in the core search experience i have seen a lot more ai generated responses and they're good like we we've talked about this before google has information on everything nobody is going to beat google in terms of information um the question is can you beat them in terms of how you present that information how you give people an interface to interact with that information and now that they're pushing this more into their search product maybe they feel like you know they're more comfortable with what it will mean for their search results and ultimately i think that you still have to put the odds on them to be the winner in whatever search looks like in the age of ai totally agree and think about that ai what perplex the ai first search well ai is stable stakes now for any search uh product so you got to have that to be in the game i'll take google's 20 plus years of data over perplexity and glad that we are where we are on that and that's also where we are with this latest episode of deep tech 3115 and on behalf of doug and jean bye for now"
DeepTech315: Micron / Amazon's Discount Store / Status of AI,2024-06-28 14:58:34+00:00,15,33J8g5O0GWI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33J8g5O0GWI,"welcome to deep tech 315 that's doug i'm jean our three topics this week is takeaways from ces second tech layoffs are beginning again and last we're going to talk about big news from herz taking a major step back from their embracement embracing evs so we'll jump to the the top of the fold doug we've made trips to ces in the past this year we didn't make trips to ces i think i've always been tainted of ces when i realized in like 2004 that apple didn't want to participate in ces because they thought it was kind of rogue tech going on there and they would put macw world back in the day that was a big event for them to announce new products right up against uh ces of course the iphone famously in 2007 was announced right around ces and so i've always kind of thought of this as a a sideshow but still a ton of people go there and there's a lot of announcements and it's worth at least one five minute segment of of this week and so my question doug is um we'll say we're just on the same page related to the importance of ces but did anything jump out to you as noteworthy hard to miss that there was a lot of talk about ai everything's about ai right now which i think is for good reason the one product that i feel like i saw all over my feed yesterday at least was this rabbit r1 so basically it's like this small probably like a i'm aging myself but like half of a game boy basically is is about how big it looks um and it's an ai connected device they kind of have like this large action uh model i believe is what they called it where you can essentially ask the device verbally to do various different things um and i believe it connects them with your smartphone and sort of handles tasks for you so the idea is it's it's sort of like this hardware based agent um i didn't personally get like the use case for it but i think it's a cool experiment you know like we're going to see a lot of experiments as we live now in this world of ai devices trying to figure out you know how do we use this software in a unique way in the physical world i agree on that and my sense too is i i didn't really see the need for a hardware piece to this it feels like this should just be something embedded in and or hey google or alexa isn't it that feels like the ultimate future for for all these things is uh siri which i don't know feels like semi-abandoned same for google assistant and alexa you know maybe they make a comeback and they do become these useful agents and and deliver on kind of the promise that we all thought maybe they had five six years ago now with these large language models that are so much more capable than the old i mean i would even want to call it ai five six years ago it feels like a a a tarnishing of what we're doing now um but that old model of ai that really wasn't that capable you know if they if they get supercharged with our current llms there may be some more promise there and i think just in terms of the concept i think of what this is doing this personalized ai piece like summon me in uber or you know book a calendar invite for friends and i that's what rabbit wants to do i think that is a a a truism i think that's going to be a clear use case for ai so i think rabbit's on the right case with that anything else uh knows an acceptable answer but anything else jump out for you at ces i'm a ces bear i i never uh really believed in spending a ton of time there i always felt like kind of once apple broke away from mac world so many years ago that the biggest companies and the biggest announcements really kind of get made on their own so you know yeah there's a lot of stuff that came out over the last couple coule uh days but i haven't seen anything where i really said wow that is gamechanging and from me from my perspective i i would put this it's not the game-changing category but something that was noteworthy sony their car a fila that's a e l a that is was announced a year ago so they showed more of like the software that's going to be built by honda branded is sony they're saying 2026 i'll take the over on that and say before 2030 before we see that vehicle and honda who's just been nowhere when it comes to evs did talk about a couple new uh evs that caught my eye again this is 2026 so late to the party but the party uh still is not over one of them looks just like uh just way too sports carry i think for most almost like a 80s lamborghini and the other is kind of a a a remix on the caravan which i thought was pretty cool in terms of how they've rethought some of this seating but you know the big picture is that i think what jumped out to me is less that sony and honda had ev announcements more that just it's still 2026 and beyond and this whole ev thing is taking longer for these companies to embrace it and for consumers as we've we're going to talk more about at the end with herz so um i would say one piece that ces did get right is ai and sometimes the themes some years it's drones some years it's 3d tvs and this year ai is they've got the theme right based on how we're seeing this at deep water that this should be the theme at ces for the next five years i mean it's hard to understate it there a reminder we think we're going into a bull market here going into a bubble related to uh ai here we're really excited about playing that front into that bubble so we're i would amend i would amend something quick too there which is i wouldn't say ces got it right i mean the companies are getting it right right like it's there's excitement and there's product coming from companies that is innovative and ces just happens to be that launching ground yeah they're the facilitator but uh yeah collectively these companies have got it right good good adjustment second topic is related to tech layoffs of course the end of 2022 beginning of 23 we had a lot of layoffs they ranged between microsoft kind of 8% up to meta had almost 30% uh that of their workforce that they laid off and then it's been pretty quiet on the front until recently we had companies like google unity letting 25% google was a pretty small percentage call it one two% uh dual lingual twitch were kind of back scene uh layoffs again and like one side of me was we didn't see the bump we didn't see the re acceleration after everything kind of settled out we're just not seeing that big uptake again or or kind of re reex accelerating to growth i guess it's it's important to look where the layoffs are are happening too i think that tells part of the story it does and i remember spotify before this kind of uh trunch of three or four i think spotify was the last big one and off the top of my head i think they were kind of like mid- teens as a percentage of total workforce um the roof that they did about a month ago and uh we were doing some media around that actually and i think i said at that time i thought like maybe we were 70% of the way through the normalization of some of the workforces that got excessively bloated in 20121 when everybody was just investing for growth and so i think this just speaks to that i think we're still probably 70 maybe now we're 75% of the way there but i wouldn't be surprised if you do still see a handful of you know meaningful significant kind of maybe for some it's mid single digits maybe for others it's mid teens kind of cuts at some of these companies because i think did go crazy in 2021 and it takes a long time to right siize i think it takes longer than you would expect and one of the one of the uh common mistakes we always saw companies make as analysts and now as investors is most companies and this is human nature you don't want to cut to the bone but that's what you should do and the one thing i'll say about unity this is a 25% riff they've done other ones before that i think were around 10% that feels like cutting to the bone and um i think they're making the right choice it's really hard they got super bloated now we have new management uh it's a stock that we actually were buying a little bit of at the end of last year so we do like the new management team and i agree with this move even though it's very aggressive i never like seeing people lose their jobs that's the headline uh as investors were uh like the focus like that cutting to the bone because that obviously means margin improvements and just one final thought we've gone back and spent a lot of time on this topic as doug mentioned over the past couple years and if you look at at least the big tech uh call it the old fang is that they had uh still have grown their headcount faster than revenue since the beginning of the pandemic even with these cuts so it gets back to your point doug there's still some more uh tweaks uh that's probably the best way to think about it in the year ahead related to head count uh speaking of cuts hurts me big cut here topic yeah this was uh rewinding uh into 2022 herz makes an announcement they're going to buy 125,000 evs from pollster and then i think they changed that to 100,000 from tesla i'm not sure how many of those 100,000 they actually bought but just a ton of excitement that kind of coincided with the peak of tesla's stock the bull case at the time was that tesla was or that these all these cars are going to get into the rental market people who don't own a tesla will get in will experience it they'll go out and they will buy the buy the cars and all things are good that did not happen in 2023 tesla grew their deliveries by 37% that of course was below the benchmark that people were shooting for going into 23 which was 50% and so uh that you know this halo effect related to herz uh didn't play out there's reasons for that it was partially ev demand esally high interest rates but then of course the big news today is that herz is cutting those 20,000 how many actual teslas they have my guess is they probably have 60,000 so they're cutting a big piece and at the end of the day people just don't want these cars and so they don't want have an inventory yeah i saw the ceo did an uh interview on cnbc i caught a clip of it earlier and he basically said you know the demand just isn't what we expected i mean those were the words he used when he was describing desing why the cut uh maybe shouldn't be surprising given some of the things we're seeing now in terms of a relative slowdown in ev sales obviously they're still growing um i think there's there's actually just a a very specific factor to renting cars that we learned at deep waterer one of jean and my partners joe rented an electric car i think from herz actually po star from hers a poar it was a pole star at our last quarterly meeting a couple months ago and he said uh the problem with renting it was you have to return it fully charged and the charging infrastructure in some places is just not obviously as people don't know how to charge them either well yeah that's the other thing you got to learn how to charge it or know how to charge it to begin with he does have an electric car so he knew how but finding the station was a pain for him right right where it's like gas stations there's 10 gas stations within you know a quarter mile of most rental places and so i think just from a again you get back to why does it take so long for new tech technology to uh prevail certainly in the physical world is because the infrastructure is just not there and so from a practical standpoint you know i'd always at least right now still want to rent a gas car not an electric car because you don't have to deal with that painful you know charging experience yeah definitely charging is a pain point i think that you know there's two ways to read this update is one is that evs are just kind of taking this slow and gradual and perpetual step back and it's going to be 50 years before we get there i'm still optimistic that this is going to be a good year for eves i think that the market overall is going to probably grow 50% i think that the overall uh car course coming off of a smaller base is more like 10% and i think these headwinds around charging especially when you're renting the car that to me makes sense that people would have uh had those types of experiences and i think another headwind is price and interest rates another headwind is range anxiety that's probably never going to quite go away even with a 400 mile battery uh but so i'm still in this camp i i have a prediction that uh that tesla is going to maintain their us ev market share in 2024 uh it's about 50% based on cox's automotive 51 to be exact it actually rose a percent from september to december most people think that tesla's market share is going to drift to the mid 30s to 40% so i'm still on board i'm still on board with evs i think they're the future yes it's going to take longer i'm g give you the final word here on this topic but my view is um this is not throw the baby out with the bath water when it comes to ev it's a setback but we're still moving towards the future of all electric one of the hardest things about being a tech investor is that you have to be a natural optimist i think all the greatest tech investors are uh in many cases pure optimists and you only have to get a couple really big ones right that's really all that matters at the end of the day and i've always struggled because i i call myself a rational optimist and my issue with evs has always been i not that i don't think it's g to happen just that i think it's going to take way longer than everybody thinks and ultimately timing does matter when you think about generating returns as an investor if you're too early right you're not going to get the returns you want you're going to be sitting in something that maybe gets some hype spike and then falls back down and you have to deal with that aftermath and obviously if you're too late then you're probably not a tech investor to begin with at that point you're looking at real cash flows so i i think there's always this careful balance you have to manage as a tech focused investor of you got to be an optimist you have to be uh excited about where the world is going and we are but you also have to be practical when there are certain things that might be headwinds in the near term and i'll i'll leave it at set aside evs ai is the next ical question we're super super optimistic about that a lot of people are really optimistic about that and we'll have to see over the next 12 18 24 months are there roadblocks we see there and be able to reassess and be dynamic and our thinking of of that as a massive trend as well can't wait that will be the gift that keeps giving ai and that's a wrap for this week on behalf of doug jean and deep tech 315 bye for now"
DeepTech315: Tesla Deliveries / Apple on OpenAI's Board / Rain's New Hire,2024-07-03 18:11:51+00:00,15,JQ2riCdM2qE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ2riCdM2qE,welcome to deep tech 315 i'm jean along with doug from deepwater and we have three juicy topics this week tesla earnings separately the ftc looking at some big uh ai deals with some of the big tech companies and last some of the chip companies have been reported we'll take it back to the top tesla earnings this is something that we uh are not tesla investors but we do track it closely relative to all the things that tesla is doing the impact on the greater supply chain what's happening in autonomy and uh also what's going on with electrification and so for those of you who aren't up to speed is that stock is down about 12% since they reported their earnings and their commentary around outlook was surprisingly negative so when tesla reports they put out an investor deck in that there's an outlook section and they just usually cut and paste this section about growth it says expect a kager growth of 50% for the next decade some years are going to be higher than others this time they changed that and said that growth will be notably slower in 2024 now on the call they did not give any context to what notably slower means and most of the analysts have taken their estimates from 19% growth for 2024 that's a similar growth rate that they post in 23 down to 133% and my expect that one is too aggressive and just quickly to fill in the blanks why this slowdown and growth is they previewed a next gen manufacturing line that's going to have a couple cheaper models in it and well they didn't say or they talked a little bit they didn't give specifics about what these cars are going to be the mere fact that they're saying that there's cheaper cars coming out has what's called the osborne effect on their current products where people can pause and want to see what's going to happen in the future and so that has a negative impact and doug when i when i saw that i was thinking i can't believe they did that like i had predicted one of my predictions in 2024 was tesla is not going to announce this cheaper car and the reason i gave back in december was that they announced this car this cheaper one because i knew it was coming but they don't want to do it in 24 because demand picture wasn't looking very good and then on top of that you have the osborne effect and it would just be shooting themselves in the foot and it um made me wonder is there actually more than the osborne effect going on here and that they're uh you know trying to hide it with the osborne effect maybe i thinking that the osborne effect is having a big impact here feels uh like a lot i mean when i heard the numbers and saw the stock reaction i wasn't that surprised because we've kind of had a bunch of ind indications that the demand around evs has not been what the market expected we had the herz news right a couple weeks ago we've had numerous of the traditional auto oem sort of slowing their plans and you know maybe and maybe the stock sort of reflected this but maybe the assumption was hey tesla's fully immune from this um but it seems like to some extent whether you know it's 50% the osborne effect or 20% who knows but i think you have to factor in what they're saying that consumer demand is just not as strong as probably everybody hoped it was yeah they did talk a little bit about the interest rates and kind of that impact that's something that they've been saying before and i think that's probably the best way to think about what's going on this year it's maybe we split the difference and say half of it's the osborne effect and half of it is something that some of those other automotive makers by my account five of the top seven have pulled back on their ev investments over the past few months which uh really brings to the for me the central question is is uh i don't want to be the one who's kicking the can down the road and say tesla's eyes going to turn the corner in a year but at the same time i don't want to uh i want to ask myself the question of is electrification gna happen and we all know what's going to happen could take 100 years could take five years uh but this this piece that comes back that i believe that they're going to end up on the right side of this where traditional car companies are pulling back on invested in evs it it looks like tesla is doubling down i mean they have this nextg manufacturing line that elon's talking about this kind of modular manufacturing which is pretty fun whether or not they can pull it off but lowers the cost of manufacturing like no other car makers are talking about that and so i keep coming back to a position that it's going to take 5 10 years to get to 35% 40% 50% market share of evs but if that even if that happens i think they're making the right decisions now to lay the groundwork to be in a good spot when that market does actually take off and does it just kind of come down to me that's what this whole conversation comes down to is what's your outlook in terms of when ev adoption actually kicks in well i think when we think about that like multiple things can be true that are uh antagonistic to one another like number one i think most reasonable people would agree that tesla makes the best evs and it's probably not particularly close uh number two the ev market can and it has been taking longer to get mass adoption than i think ev bulls or maybe even people who are sort of neutral on evs expected we're seeing that kind of slowdown run its course this year and we'll see how long that lasts and then three like i also think as you think about that 5 to 10 year window do we get to 30% do we get to 50% it's probably somewhere in that range i would guess you know by by year 10 i would be shocked if evs aren't in that 30 to 50% window i don't think they're above 50 that would be my bet i think gas has a longer life than we probably all want to admit um but as part of that component i think that you know the traditional oems are still going to have a place in the market for a really long time doesn't mean i think you should be long them because we don't own any of them um but i think that we think about how the auto industry is going to change sometimes when we talk about tesla we talk about how great the company is how great their product is there's like this assumption that you know all of a sudden everything's just going to be tesla and all these other oems go away i don't think that's going to be true it's going to be this very long sort of drawn out thing tesla is ultimately going to be in a great place but it's just going to take time i want to hit a couple other topics related to test so one was fsd they didn't say total miles driven this is a metric that i've been tracking close most ly it's been slowing pretty significantly on a quarter over quarter basis that's the best way to look at it so it grew 100% from march to june the total miles driven and then june to september that was 78% and september december it was 44% so we saw a pretty marked deceleration the numbers are getting higher so in a normal circumstance that's a that's an expectation you'd have is to expect this sequential uh slowdown in growth rates but when things are taking off like a a technology is taking off and getting ready to be mainstream you'd probably see those growth rates being right around 100% stay at 100% which tells me that the number of miles fsd miles that are driven that was the metric fsd miles driven still hasn't had that inflection point so my belief i'm a believer in autonomy i think that the world needs it is that it's still in that category of taking longer elon thinks it's a year away you may have heard that before uh so wanted to give a quick update on autonomy and then get your take on optimus uh which he said maybe next year optimus prime is available the the humanoid uh i think i might have laughed out loud when he said uh maybe next year let's just we don't even need to discuss how whether i i think well to elon's credit i think on the call he did also say or he admitted that he is sometimes optimistic on his timeline so i'm glad i appreciate his optimism um maybe in uh some case his uh blind optimism but i wanted to just forget about his timing and all that but just the concept of the humanoid and the robot then the what andrew from deep water was talking about just the world is kind of segmented into two parts of robotic or opportunities we have vehicles that we move around and then when we get to where we move around we go and work and so it makes sense to have an autonomous vehicle and then an autonomous human which would be a humanoid and i would i mean to me that makes a lot of sense i love your take like let's forget about the technical challenges of of doing optimus but just the concept of a humanoid is that something as musk would say could just like unlock uh unbridled growth in gdp yes it could but we kind of have to go back to i think the same thing we just learned from the ev market is there an opportunity to create humanoid robots i think there is is it going to take way longer than we expect i think it will i think first before we even get there we're going to see a ton of automation happen on the purely digital side stuff that we're seeing right now with the breakout of large language models with the breakout of gpt so knowledge work stuff like that a lot of that is going to get transformed by automation long before i think anything in the physical world at scale gets transformed with these sorts of robots so you're talking about auto automating like for lack of a better word information work yes okay yes because it's easier to manipulate bs than it is atoms but when i think about the humanoid i think the opportunity is just like more the labor market like that's the wrong way to say the more the physical labor market yeah and i think the the challenge and this is why there's potential with that humanoid robot but i've always felt like the challenges think about the work that an electrician does i mean i've worked as as an electrician before i know it intimately like every problem is different every house is different pulling wires through every wall is different right setting up uh hvac is different in every single scenario and so when you have information work and you're just dealing with the bits and like figuring out what does language mean right which is what the breakthrough has been in ai to be able to do physical labor like meaningful physical labor like you're talking about and really transform i think the high-paying jobs that is really far away in my opinion like that's not something we're going to see robots do in 10 years i'd be shocked if an optimist was able to do anything meaningful as an electrical contractor as a plumber right as any sort of trades person could they move boxes sure but you already have amazon you know at scale running robots in its warehouses moving boxes alongside humans um and they don't need humanoids to do that i'm a lumberjack you you in my free time uh should i be worried about my hobby going way i don't think so not for not for a little while okay by the way my my guess is uh oh inside talk here you can translate what uh tech u investors think if they say it's five years out that means we think it's it's close but really don't know when it is or kind of close when they say 10 years it means i really don't know when it's going to happen but i think it's going to happen and i was saying that it's 10 years out optimus prime so uh we can go on to our next topic here which is the ftc uh they've gone they're going back now now they're going back and looking at what's happened with google and excuse me microsoft and openai google amazon and thropic and basically getting some uh their the share stake half of it two a third of these kind of foundation companies these anointed late stage private companies they're going to be so important in the future mega cap tech already has influence on it and so what does this mean for how the whole ai story is going to play out if the ftc starts to exert some some of their force of will first of all i don't i don't think they'll be successful exerting force of will here i mean we've already seen the ftc lose in the activision microsoft case so there's a big example of uh you know one of these tech dominant tech giants buying in fact another dominant company in an adjacent industry in gaming um and the courts felt like that was not anti-competitive i think that ultimately if this ever got to that point i would have a hard time believing that uh these deals would be found as anti-competitive so i'll start there as a baseline like i don't think anything's going to come of this is the short answer um what i think it does do though is it highlights that uh here's the reality of of building these foundation model companies is they're hugely cap intensive they require a ton of compute and who has compute the hyperscalers have compute amazon google microsoft the three biggest cloud computing companies in the world it's not an accident that they are the ones that are ending up funding this and by the way part of these deals um does include cloud credits right so i mean that's that's kind of baked into what these deals were all about and so ultimately like i think it kind of highlights the reality that for these foundation model companies they need access to a lot of capital they need access to a lot of compute and it is the tech giants that have both love it we're going to jump to our final topic which is the chips side i want you to give a quick take on intel uh their results 30 seconds and i'm going to do 30 seconds on asml intel uh we have talked about uh a product that i've been experimenting with using ai to pick stocks before uh that product is called intelligent alpha i have a long short strategy i'm running uh and it is and was short intel going into this quarter so that's my favorite part of the report nothing nothing against intel um but i think the bottom line with intel is you know the company has been challenged now for several years they have competition coming from amd they have this uh broad shift in terms of data center from uh cpus to now gpus and accelerated compute which is something that nvidia and amd are quite good at um and so i think it's just kind of a continuation of that you know i i root for intel because i want to see them build an alternative sort of foundry solution just from a a geopolitical standpoint but the execution has been difficult love it i'll do asml many of you may have never heard of asml it's a dutch company it's a 350 billion us doll market cap company we do own it in the deep water frontier tech etf ticker l had a great quarter uh stocks up caught 15% on their report they build machines that go to like tsmc and eventually to intel for their foundaries or samsung in their foundry the they they sold a whopping 15 of those machines in the december quarter they run about $200 million a pop uh so very there's no other company that can do this and uh the expectations that they were going to sell four so uh i think this is another great example of all of goodness that's going on at the hardware level we've talked about in the past we do also own tsmc asml tsmc they go hand and glove and that's a wrap for this week in deep tech 315 on behalf of doug i'm jean bye for now
AI Depth Finder: AI Benchmarking / Predicting the Future / OpenAI's Board,2024-07-10 20:39:25+00:00,6,IDQcAYhAaIA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDQcAYhAaIA,i'm doug clinton co-founder and partner at deepwater asset management and this is the dlo podcast where i talk to founders and builders building frontier technology companies that change how we live today i talk with ramsis alcade he's the ceo and founder of nural nural is a portfolio company for deep water it's actually one of the first investments we ever made and neurable creates brain computer interfaces which we refer to as b bci in the episode bcis allow computers to understand signals coming from the brain and some bcis actually even let computers send signal back to the brain on the episode ramis and i talk about neurals upcoming mw 75 neuro headset launch how bci can help people perform and focus better and even how bci can improve our experiences with consumer ai products here is the episode all right ramses thanks for joining me today i'm excited to talk to you about everything you guys are doing at neurable thanks thanks yeah it's been a it's been a long journey but we're really starting to hit a big stride right now yeah i mean the the long journey i go back to uh 2016 i think it was when we first met you you were uh in your lab in michigan and i remember uh my partner g and i we came out to see you and you had um one of the people on your team was controlling i think it was jeff he was controlling a remote control car with this crazy looking eeg headset with his brain waves and i was like this is the coolest thing i've ever seen so i mean that's whatever seven years ago now and we're just getting ready for you to kind of bring that to market which is super exciting i know you just had a great ces you won a ton of awards best of ces from rolling stone um so to your point it's been a long journey so let's talk about the journey first and maybe just start with kind of what is the vision for neurable why did you start the company and what do you want to do yeah definitely i mean the the vision of the company is how do we make neurotechnology accessible you know right now we have so many incredible solutions in neuroscience uh that are just not reachable with the way that current technology the the way neurot technology works right now just to give you an example of a friend of mine who is working with the university of columbia and they have this technology that can detect alzheimer's 10 years before you get it which is amazing right you have to go to this lab once a month and for five minutes wear this cap with gel on your head and the thing is no matter how incredible the technology is no one's going to do that like no one goes to a lab every single month for five minutes to check if 10 years from now they're going to get alzheimer's it just it doesn't happen right and so but what if you could bring that to an everyday device like a pair of headphones or earbuds that you already wear every single day and so that was the the the the the mission of the company essentially and and it really started out in 2011 as part of my phd work where we created a technology that could increase the signal to noise of brain data and back then what we could do is take what would traditionally be 128 sensor system and bring it down to the cap that you're using uh which had gel everywhere and like you know going down people's faces but still get the same performance metrics as these larger cap systems and since then we've been evolving the technology to go to smaller and smaller form factors to go from wet electro gel caps to dry and now finally bringing them down to headphones and earbuds while still retaining all that same rich data so that you can still build tools applications and science on top of these devices and that product you mentioned headphones is something that is really close to coming to market yeah definitely so what we do is we license that ai that develop those was developed at the university of michigan to different headphone companies the first partner is a company called master and dynamic you can actually already pre-order those those devices um through our website and then very soon you know they're they're going to get shipped which is crazy to think that this entire journey you know has been built out but in the near future if you buy a pair of head headphones and earbuds chances are they they're going to have neurot technology inside and that neurot technology comes from our company so yeah everybody should go check out the headset on neural.one but you can already start pre-ordering so we know how many to make uh and yeah i mean the response that we got at cs was amazing right to and and this was such a validating moment because it was the first time that we ever really shared it outside of like our own testing you know we gave it to reporters they they played around with the technology they could have written anything that they wanted right and we ended up winning eight awards uh for best of cs best headphones tom's guy said that this their favorite headphones for for the year right uh and so being able to see such great user response was really validating for such a long journey yeah yeah i love that um and i i can't wait to get one we ordered one and um i'm curious what should i expect like what what will the product do for me and how will it kind of enhance my my life and workflow yeah definitely i mean right now we have an entire like 18month product plan with with this technology um at first it's going to be for monitoring your focus to prevent burnout what's really interesting is when people feel tired it's way past the point that they should have taken a break uh taking a break is kind of like dehydration if if you feel dehydrated you should have already drank water you should be drinking water throughout the day uh and so our technolog is able to detect that identify when you need to take a break uh and then give you other recommendations like how to improve your your focus lengths uh as our ability to focus keep continues to get shorter and shorter our technology helps you recover some of that uh and then on top of that it'll give you suggestions on what time of day is the best time for you to do specific type of works maybe deep focus versus just answering emails that's what's coming on the original launch product but through software updates we'll be adding more capabilities in in the next 18 months such as being able to switch music tracks using handsfree voice free controls which is going to be really exciting um having customized playlists that help you focus or or achieve a certain certain state or mood but essentially it's like an apple watch for your brain right it's an apple watch for the most important organ that we're not currently tracking i love apple watch for the brain is a pretty good pretty good heris stic what what have you noticed i'm curious in using the product yourself about your focus maybe that you that you didn't expect yeah i mean i suffer from adhd it's something that's that's been a big issue since i was a young kid and and what noticed is that i've just used a lot less medication recently in my life you know um one of the biggest challenges that i have is for example reading a book right the the biggest issue that i have is i'll start reading the page of a book and after the first paragraph i'll get distracted and then like my eyes will reach the bottom of the book and then i'll be like wait a minute you know what was i doing again like you know i know the feeling and and i totally captured none of that right so we have this cool system it's not going to roll out at launch but it's very shortly after but essentially when you start to read or do a task that you're focused on and you get distracted it'll play a small audible tone um and so when i'm reading that book and i hit that paragraph it's like oh wait i'm distracted right now and then i'm able to get back into reading it uh instead of figuring out that i got distracted at the end of the page i figured out as soon as i get distracted and so now i'm able to read without you know too much uh issues you know um i'm able to know which days i need to take medication versus not these are things that i'm just self- exploring uh but have added a lot of value for me personally and it's amazing to see what other people are identifying there's a person that used to drink coffee in the mornings and then one day he skipped it and he saw his focus didn't change but in the afternoons he that's when he was burnt out even when he drank coffee and so now he started drinking coffee in the afternoons and it turns out that he's able to get two really good productivity sessions in the day instead of just one where he was over burning himself out in the morning verus versus now having more balanced you know productivity throughout the day so there's so many cool things like that that we're seeing that pro or the uh that behavioral change is super interesting and something i wanted to dig into where i'm i'm wondering if as you think about that book example right getting the tone notifying you that you're sort of losing focus do you think it'll retrain in some ways how we focus how we think just how our brain works i think so and and just sharing this from my own person experience not necessarily from the book side of things but there's this demo that we have where you can essentially focus on a task and you'll see a line go up and then when you distract yourself it'll go down just getting so many cycles of doing that mainly because i'm pitching to investors and showing people the technology like i now know what it feels like to be in deep focus right and so whenever i'm working on slides or i'm working on something else that's new i've i know how it feels like to be in focus and so i can turn that on now more than i ever have before in my life uh and so i think that you know there's going to be situations where people are going to get just organically learn more about themselves right and through that learning about yourself because this technology enables you to learn how your brain feels it's it's it's interesting because you can feel sore right that's that's your body telling you that you're hurt you're injured you need to take a break it's hard to feel sore in your brain right like that's not a gateway that's easy to access and so our technology enables people to do that and through having that layer of communication i think that people are going to learn and grow from it so much more than they think let's go back to the apple watch for your brain analogy and i'm i'm thinking back to the apple watch kind of when it first came out you know had this more limited function set monitor your heart rate you know a few things right and then gradually they opened it up to developers and the the usefulness of the watch expanded is that the same vision that you have for the headset and and your software broadly yeah exactly so at first the apple watch was for monitoring heart rate and movement you know and like closing your circles was about it right now you can capture hard arhythmia right you can capture fall detection right people can develop apps so that your gps is with you wherever you go instead have to carrying your phone right you can make calls off of it so that's how we see a lot of these cables is what we call them so hearing based wearables evolving toward as well too right so with software we'll be updating the headsets so that they go from tracking your focus to essentially uh longer term helping you control them or tracking your health biometrics a lot of these ai devices that you see now for example like humane or or rabbit where there's like this intelligent ai that has no screen well you know what that's just going to be your headphones you know you're just going to have an airpod in or a pair of of headphones on and you're going to talk to it and you're going to control it using brain activity and it's going to be your wearable device as well too uh so i don't think we need a whole new device or pin to access that that's actually organically where our wearables are going to go uh and and i i personally believe it's going to be through your hearable technology because you don't want extra things on your body you just want to carry your headphones with you because that's also how you do your audio and then that's your holistic system for for 90 to 95 % of the things you do i mean it makes total sense your voice i think always seems like logically it should be the most natural communication interface we have with machines uh maybe that becomes brain waves maybe that's kind of the future of bci but how do you think about those two working together i guess if we think about the future of ai and now you know smarter smart assistance how does maybe understanding what's happening in our brain assist whether we're giving input through voice or maybe other mechanisms yeah i think that they're highly tied together you know and and we're already working on on ways of combining them right uh i'll give you one direct example and one indirect example so you can actually pick up small muscular activities around the ear of a person moving their lips and to the precision where you can get words right um and it's a very limited dictionary set it's just a few words few commands but essentially that information can be used as part of the neural network data of these uh voice technology systems because what prevents voice from being used at scale one is that there's too much interference of everything around you right so what if we had an additional layer of data that didn't care about noise around you because it has to do with electrical activity around your brain right around your head uh so it'll help augment those systems on top of that your brain actually has responses is whenever you hear something that's wrong so for example if you're asking for a a you know you know this was back a few months ago but like those little baby yoda toys were really popular right so if you were asking for a toy yoda uh and it thought you meant the car the toyota car you know your brain actually recognizes that and creates a brain wave um we can actually pick that up and say hey this was the wrong thing that was selected try again and that can all happen seamless your your amazon alexa system for example could say oh i think i got it wrong did you actually mean x and now you know you don't have to interrupt the system or rush over there and be like no no don't order me a car right like uh essentially it's like a seamless experience of of it understanding when it got it wrong and self-correcting that's a pretty killer use case i mean i don't i feel like i haven't heard anybody sort of talking about that but that's super important when we think about i mean the value the way we judge these ais is whether or not they seem to give give answers that are useful to us and getting that feedback immediately and not having to say no and then correct it is a big step function improvement yeah for sure for sure and uh and yeah and actually there's a great presentation that i did uh and i can send it to you after this call uh but essentially is with hartman ventures and and i and i describe some of these different ways how we use voice technology with brain data to self-correct or self you know navigate these situations because that's really the future right now what we're missing is a is a seamless feedback system that isn't you talking again um and and that's really going to help a lot of these uh technologies out that we work with that makes total sense who do you i'm going to put you on the spot a little bit who do you think i mean of these voice assistant companies right we've got the big three apple uh amazon with alexa google with assistant who do you think might be the first one if you had to bet on it that would incorporate uh brain data o man you are putting on the spot huh yeah um yeah i mean um i don't think i can say i can't respond to it without breaking an nda so you know like uh i i'll probably just say that these companies are working on this technology and we already have partners with some of the the best companies in the world to roll out products with them in the next few years um so it's not a far-fetched concept you know it's just a matter of of getting there so that's my way of dodging the question well done well done good news for consumers though we're gonna get it sometime hopefully soon um for sure we we've talked about you know bci as sort of this layer that can enhance interface in many different ways um maybe somewhat as as even an enhancer for performance as well how do you i mean how do you just think about bci as a as a category like is it an interface is it is it an enhancing technology for humans is it something else you know how do you frame that i think the best way is i had a vc one time asked me like why don't you have a a a tam slide you know total addressable market slide in your deck and i responded by saying like neurotech neurotechnology is kind of like saying what is the total addressable market of software right like you use software for video games for smart water bottles right for sleep a uses it for your sleep right like there's just such an infinite number of applications right neurotechnology is the same way you can use it for for example we're working with dod for fatigue prevention of accidents that costs $3 billion dolls yearly right uh there's truck drivers and and preventing accidents there there's blast exposures tbi detection there's focus algorithms for for consumers right it's just such a large pool and so our goal is how do we create a reliable enough brain computer interface in an everyday form factor to empower others to build out some of those solutions some of them were going to do but really the main value here is how do we create such an easyto build system up uh system so that others can build because there's just way too much to create here right it's like trying to own all of software it's actually better just to say like we're going to make the best software tool and have and and just make sure we get a little bit of a cut from everything people make yeah that's what neurable ai is all about that's what will power the headphones um and i'm i'm also wondering too since you've been using you know ai machine learning techniques i mean for for years now to work on this problem has anything meaningfully change for you i guess in terms of the approaches that you've used from a machine intelligence standpoint to process this signal like in this era of you know the golden llm sort of ai era or are you still using you know a lot the same approaches that you used before it's a little bit of mixture of both you know uh we to be honest the system that i first developed in 2011 and and started spinning out in 2015 16 when we met um is completely different now than what it was then the team has just done such an incredible job i take like zero credit for where we're at right now they they've done a thousand times better than i could even possibly imagine um so like because of that reason we're using a lot more of the newer techniques that are out and and the fact that chips can now do neural processing a lot better like we we leverage that type of uh you know advancement as well too there are a few things that have stayed um from those early days but honestly like this entire you know burst that's happening in ai is only helping us achieve where we're going to faster you know we probably needed more expensive hardware in the past that's why we had large pcs back when in 200 i think it was 19 when we you know caught up with our vr system i don't know if you remember that system but we needed we needed giant pcs to process our models yeah i had to carry these giant pcs everywhere with then i went to go demo right now we don't have to do that so there's there's just so many advancements happening that are enabling this timing to be a really solid timing for this type of technology yeah it's it's benefiting everybody one one other question i had if you think about bci more broadly uh people have heard probably a lot about technology like neuralink you know highly invasive approaches to bci but it sounds like you've been able to achieve pretty profound things obviously with no invasive surgery so how do you think about i guess the field in the context of what's possible just using you know a software-based approach non-invasive approach like neurable versus stuff like a neuralink or even a parad dromic which is another portfolio company of ours yeah definitely i mean i think both are important you know um i love what neuralink and paradromics are doing i think that they're very different is how i see them you know for example one is actually i'll give this example like a a hip replacement a hip replacement is probably the most successful invasive surgery ever but you would never get a hip replacement unless you needed one right even if your even if a hip replacement made it so that your hips were a thousand times better than they are now you probably still wouldn't get one right and that's going to be the unfortunate truth for a lot of these invasive systems right for people with als they're going to want to use an invasive system maybe somebody who needs to control a prosthetic device may consider one right uh but it's going to be a very long time before these invasive systems become something that becomes standard right just because they're opening your body right but when it comes to non-invasive there's this entire ocean of applications that we have trapped in laboratories that are great solutions for problems that exist now and you would buy an apple watch right you would buy a pair of smart shoes for example or airpods um and now if those gave you the ability to for example an apple watch now can track parkinson's right it can be used for hard arhythmia right and so you don't need an invasive heart sensor to now track heart arrhythmias right to tell you that you might need some sort of cardiac attention earlier right um and so those are all things that essentially i see for the brain there's so many incredibly lwh hanging fruits that we can give access to that don't require surgery and they're just two different classes of brain computer interfaces so it seems like maybe if we fast forward i don't know five 10 years out maybe the most advanced applications the most advanced things that people are trying to do whether that's maybe restore hearing or motion to a limb or something like that maybe that's where you go for the full invasive approach but maybe a lot of the things that we think we might need invasive technologies for maybe we don't maybe we can get it done with something like neural yeah and and some of these things you may not even need to go all the way to invasive for example restoring hearing right maybe the most you know individuals who have the most hearing loss potentially right but for people who have moderate hearing loss maybe their airpods or their hearing aids just take brain data in and know how to change the tuning a little bit right um which is something that you can do with current neurot technology systems and that's actually something that we have in our road map as well too which is like intelligent audio tuning or intelligent noise cancellation based off of hearing loss or what the person's attending to right and so for for an individual who has complete hearing loss you probably do need some sort of neural surgery but somebody who you know the 99% of people who can hear well and uh but are just aging naturally then we have a technology that doesn't require surgery that just grows with them transitions with them um music adapts without them even knowing that they're getting you know still being able to hear the same music the way they heard it 10 years ago i feel like we're learning so many different cool use cases for your technology we just heard about uh improving hearing right for mild to moderate hearing loss we heard about error detection and and correction potentially for like voice assistance what as you've experimented with and sort of maybe identified other potential use cases for nural what's what's like the coolest one that you're most excited about uh i i'll give you two actually um because one is like practically speaking and the other one's just like cool factor uh practically speaking i really want to smart noise cancellation that that works intelligently you know especially now that the new airpods have that adaptive system where they can hear if you're talking to somebody and they lower the volume that never works for me it has never worked for me especially walking around in public when that's on like somebody's just yelling across the street and then my music goes down and like i just missed my favorite part right it's it just does not work so to me it's like imagine having a system where you're for example on the plane you're watching a movie a flight attendant starts talking to you we notice that your attention goes from whatever you're listening to right now which would be the movie to now this other person right so imagine your headphones automatically paused the movie for you you know it decreased all the background noise and the noise of the person speaking next to you but increased the sound of the flight attendant like having that type of dynamic you know and seamless noise cancellation i think would just be incredible like that that i can't wait for and then you see a lot of people walking around with one airpod in their ear or like with adaptive like with with like with like um what's that other mode that that they have where it's just the transparency mode there transparency like yeah you see people transparency mode or or with one airpod and the reason for that is because we don't have adaptive anc right we don't have a way to control what we're listening to dynamically and so being able to enable that i think is going to be amazing i can't wait for that um and then just the cool factor is is like just switching a music track by not having to use my hands you know it's like it's not really that needed but like it'd be cool to be at the gym lifting a weight and if i don't like the song i could just you know think or or click in some sort of way to switch the music track like that would be really cool you get that extra rep that's that's gains exactly that is cool um so right let's let's end on this note as you think about the brain computer interface world going into 2024 what is the most exciting thing that we should all be paying attention to for bci this year this is going to sound like i am uh i am selling out or something but like you should definitely pay attention to us like we we just introduced this product it's the first time brin computer interface works seamlessly new software updates are going to be continuously rolled out i you know it's just it's the first time that we're going to see this technology work like a product and not a science project to me that's the most exciting thing that that i know uh that that's com to market uh but just to give some love to a few other things you know obviously neuralink is going to keep doing what they're doing there's going to be you know they're going to human trials which is going to be pretty exciting uh and you know you start to you're seeing patents now for big tech companies for doing inar like uh brain-based sensors so that's pretty exciting i mean this whole industry is starting to starting to happen so um you know i think it's going to be a hot industry this year it is it is to your point earlier long time coming you guys have done such a great job i think kind of pioneering the industry and so everybody should check out the uh it's the mw 75 neuro the headphones on nur. we'll put the link in the show notes but ram says thanks for educating us on everything you're building at neurable for sure thank you doug
DeepTech315: Apple & EU / Robotaxi Delay / AI Chatbot Research,2024-07-12 21:12:34+00:00,15,Kyzq_7B8CSY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kyzq_7B8CSY,welcome to pressure points our topic today is why meta investors should be watching what's going on with tick tock and before we jump into the pressure point which is this does have material opportunity for meta given the time spent on tik tok before we dive into that i want to give some context to the conversation more broadly is that the ban on tik tok has been something that has been orbiting the political sphere for the past several years and it is one of those rare topics that gets bipartisan support basically a tough on china support and it has more recently had a wrinkle with as trump has uh suggested that he no longer supports a ban on tik tok in part because it benefits meta and when i saw that com heard that comment i knew it had a benefit to it but didn't fully appreciate the benefit until i dug deeper into the numbers and so we'll stay outside of the political dynamics about who and why is doing what here and just point out that there are three potential outcomes one of course is nothing happens and iid put that outcome at 50% a second is that a spin out happens i' put that at 30% uh the reason why i put it at a lower percentage then nothing happens is that bite dance the parent company of tik tock a chinese based company has said that they do not support a spin out of tik tok and then uh the last piece is an outright ban when i put those odds at 20% if you have asked me a few weeks ago i would have put the odds at greater than 50 that a ban happened but trump's recent comments changed my math on this but in this case we got three different outcomes the first two outcomes nothing happens or a spin out is going to basically be no benefit to meta and the outcome that something actually gets banned that's when this gets exciting for meta so just want to put some context shifting to the pressure point first thing that's important to understand is the number of daus uh tik tock has reported they have 170 million us daus now meta doesn't report their us daus they do report us and canada and about 90% of that number is related to the us based on my estimate and what typically if you look at a lot of the the context between us and canada so that would put the daus in the us in the december quarter at 180 million basically the same as tik tok now the second piece to this is time spent and neither of the companies break out time spent there's a lot of thirdparty data out there but in general it looks like that instagram which includes reals has about 30 to 40 minutes of average time spent in the us where tik tok is somewhere between 60 and 80 minutes so figure that time spent on tik tok is about double what time spent is on instagram now meta has other properties like facebook but and marketplace and there's other properties that take time but for the most part it's really about instagram and i would generally think about this is uh that the time spent on tik tok is about 2x what it is on instagram the uh other piece to it is those 170 million users for tik tok and 180 million for meta there's obviously huge overlap between those two there's about 300 call it 35 million people in the us but there's a lot of overlap between those two that doesn't matter the overlap the key topic here is just time spent and the ability for meta potentially to grab some of that time that is currently spent on tik tok and so if we go a layer deeper into this that 180 million daus in calendar 23 generated 55 bill billion in revenue for tik tok that's us revenue for ti excuse me for meta 55 billion in revenue for meta and so the opportunity if tik tok does get banned in theory for time spent in the us to effectively double on reals or on on instagram uh that presents a measurable revenue opportunity and that's where the sensitivity comes into play here if we take some of the estimates there's a few estimates out there about what tik tock did in us revenue in 20123 at the low end those estimates are 10 billion at the high end 15 billion far below the 55 billion that meta has and the reason is meta's just got better relationships with advertisers they just have a lot better of a machine to monetize that time and so you can see some of the efficiency differences in monetization give their revenue differences but presumably if meta was going to take over some of that time spent they could put it through their higher more efficient uh monetization machine and get more than 10 or 15 billion dollars in revenue from that so i'm going to switch and think about talk about this in terms of what it means for meta's overall business but kind of if you take that low end that they capture 10 billion in revenue uh if in fact it does tik tock does get banned in the us that would increase their overall business by 7% and then if you take a belief that it could increase by 15 billion that would add 11% to 2024 revenue and if you take the belief that they can generate 25 billion again below the 55 billion that the current business in the us but they could generate an additional 25 billion uh that would add 16% to the overall business and so these numbers matter again the probability on this i've got it at one and five that tik tok ultimately gets banned but if that does happen uh this could have a material impact on meta's business a topic that will likely continue even if there is a passage in the house and the senate related to this uh this potentially the impact of the presidency is going to have could have a another impact that something gets um changed after there a potential change in presidency too so but the big picture is this does matter for meta topic we're going to be spending a lot of time tracking here on behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now
DeepTech315: Nasdaq Slip / Netflix Earnings / Importance of Cybersecurity,2024-07-19 18:58:52+00:00,15,m03Iau14ysY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m03Iau14ysY,[music] welcome to this week's episode of frontier and center where we of course talk about frontier tech frontier tech is the technologies that are going to change how we live our lives in three to five years and we start each episode by recapping the performance of how frontier tech is seen by the marketplace we measure that performance by deep waters frontier tech etf that ticker is l u and the past week it's had a strong week it's now now exceeding the nasdaq performance up 8% year-to date the nasdaq is up 7% and since inception which was summer of 2018 l is up 80% and so now we jump into a focus on one of the companies within that index that etf and the company we're going to highlight this year is roblox of course if you have any kids you probably have heard of roblox this is a gaming platform they allow users to and developers to build games on top of this platform uh this is a 20 call it$ 28 billion market cap company they'll do about 3.3 billion in revenue this year it's going to be up about 15% over 2023 and next year the expectations are they're going to grow revenue about 177% so that's at just the highest level the reason why this is part of the frontier tech etf is that we see the opportunity they have of building more immersive games as something that is just going to become a bigger part of our lives going forward and they've got an opportunity to do that they also have a view that the metaverse whether you want to call the metaverse or spatial computing is going to play a bigger impact on our lives they're building applications to allow their platform to be enabled on these new devices whether it's meta's quest or apple's vision pro and so that's the a big picture why this is part of the etf i'm going to dig uh deeper into uh just kind of the basics of roblox as i mentioned this is a platform that allows developers and users to build games on they're about 72 million users there are tens of millions of games so a lot of games out there the the basic idea is this building block it has some similarities to minecraft but the types of games have are are very different they tend to skew to call it 8 to 15 year olds in that range uh there is most of the games are these constructive kind of building type of games there are some firstperson shooter games uh but the big picture is that this is a dynamic platform uh the way that roblox makes money is that these users and developers who are building games sell virtual goods and they take a cut of those those virtual good sales more recently roblox has started uh to advertise bringing in some big brand advertisers and they are doing some creative ways to kind of seamlessly uh add ads to and within the platform they added 69 new advertisers in the december 23 quarter that's just an emerging part of their business so if you think about the revenue model on roblox it's a combination of virtual goods and what will be increasing uh contribution from advertisers the uh the big rub against this company was this was a darling back in the uh the covid days obviously that had a big impact positive impact on gaming and that the time the average time spent was about a 1 hour and 10 minutes per day for users in the us and canada that was at the peak of the pandemic since then that time has declined down to 53 minutes per day these are are deep water estimates so we've seen this kind of decline uh in the number of uh minutes play a day users have grown nicely through that time they grew at 23% in 2022 and 22% in 2023 and so we've had some nice user growth that time spent number has come down but effectively the stock since its peak back at the at the height of the pandemic it's down call it 65% so there has been i think a loss of confidence from wall street and the ability for this company to really uh grow its users outside of the pandemic and specifically grow in the d uh the demographic 13 and above and there is this belief that basically since it's geared towards younger users eventually you age out of the game and you can never really build a big business around it they have made progress at holding on to those users above age 13 for example in the december 23 quarter they announced that 58% of their users are now above the age of 13 so that's moving in the right direction as they continue to uh have these other games that are more appealing to an older audience but that's kind of one of the key things to track is how they're doing in that post 13 age demo and they are making progress within that so a big picture here no other platform has the uh the connection i think with younger users but also this ability to quickly ramp up games and as users and developers better best understand about what kind of games people want they can quickly spin those games up and roblox is a beneficiary of that especially as those games become more immersive and opportunities uh continue to increase around spatial computing and the metaverse and so that's roblocks and that is our wrap on this week's episode of frontier and center on behalf of deep water i'm jean bye for now
Pressure Points: Tesla 2Q'24 Earnings,2024-07-24 00:45:58+00:00,8,DBoWOjPNS30,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBoWOjPNS30,[music] welcome to this week's episode of frontier and center i'm jean monster our topic today our focus company is crowd strike before we jump into that we always start by talking about the bigger picture in frontier tech as a reminder frontier tech is the concept of investing in technologies that will change our lives in three to five years one way we can benchmark that is to look at how the deep waterer frontier tech etf took l is performing relative to the broader market and year-to date it's up 155% l is relative to the nasdaq which is up just under 10% and life to date which is summer of 2018 uh l is up 89% so the takeaway there is that the market continues to view these frontier tech companies favorable relative to the opportunities whether it being ai longevity spatial computing and robotics and so we're going to drill deeper and talk about one of the portfolio companies and that is crowd strike this is a security company it was founded in 2011 by george curts he was the former cto of mcafee of course we all know mcafee back in the day the norton mcafee kind of antivirus plays and he saw an opportunity to create a company that approach that endpoint security whether it's last laptops or phones endpoint security in a unique way uh and what he wanted to do was make it so you didn't have to worry about updating your uh scanning your computer for viruses manually he wanted a more dynamic realtime uh solution that identifies threats and then does threat remediation and basically contains and gets rid of some of those threats and so that was kind of the founding principles of crowd strike again founded in 2011 the company has grown a lot it's a now a78 billion market cap and it's had a great year the past year the stock is up 155% and so that has been resonating is a broader macro related to more security threats out there benefits companies like crowd strike but what is unique about crowd strike is they are gaining share and if you look at more recently in the december earnings how crowd strike did relative to pa networks crowd strike had a good quarter ap ao networks another well-regarded security company had some challenges when they started talking about 2024 and so in the security space it is not all rising tide lifts all boats there is a point of distinction here and crowd strike is making progress and the reason is that their approach i talked about that they started in the endpoint but they've used that infrastructure that architecture of getting soft software on devices these agents on devices and then selling different modules basically different areas that you can protect whether its identity uh you could have a data protecting endpoint devices we talked about that or network they have over 20 different modules that you can protect but each of those can be turned down through a software piece that has two advantages versus other security companies which have some hardware or standalone pieces to their solution and the advantages are that once that agent is installed it's easy to upsell different modules and separately the cost of that is relatively low so in the case of crowd strike they have margins that are high their gross margins are in the high 70% range the operating margin currently is around 22% and so at its most basic level crowd strike is in this security space uh they have used a unique approach to this by having an agent that can expand and cover other pieces and by doing that they are gaining share because there has been a shift in terms of how companies are protecting their data up until a few years ago it was mostly best of breed so these companies wanted to have the best solution for example the network or the best solution for the endpoint and now what they are moving to is best in breed in the case of crowd strike is the ability they do everything and bring together that ends up having a lower cost uh from a human perspective in terms of managing these systems and separately is since a single point is managing the systems it ends up actually creating a more secure network and more secure endpoints and so that has been resonating crowd strike is gaining share where pao alto has been doing well they have not been doing as well in terms of gaining share and those two businesses think about about half of their business is overlap in terms of of revenue so all this is from a a fundamental perspective things are going well and is the reason why it is in the etf is because we have a belief that there is going to be increased security threats and a best of breed solution is going to uh a platform is going to continue to gain share there are some be cases to the crow strike and one of them is related to competition and in this case it's mostly about microsoft and they have a free product essentially does a lot of the same things that crowd strike does but microsoft's free product has had some challenges to it they had a breach uh late last year related to some corporate emails and that does not bode well for their brand microsoft brand insecurity and separately is their systems tend to take more humans to manage it therefore the cost of ownership and ends up being actually higher than what crowd strike is and so free isn't actually free there's no such thing as a free lunch in this case and that is one of the reasons why crowd strike despite this kind of continuing belief that microsoft will end up being negative uh to their business we have not seen that uh the microsoft piece does not concern us the piece that does concern us relative to our ownership in crowd strike or having it as part of the etf is the valuation and when we originally initiated the position it was trading at nine times ford revenue it's currently trading at 19 times uh that equates to 82 times earnings so i would put this in the category of a sky high valuation now they continue to deliver so the fundamentals of the business are really good but on the valuation perspective this is something internally we talk a lot about what that risk reward is now relative to a year ago has changed so we currently believe that the business is in a position to continue to exceed expectations and therefore the stock can continue to well but as we think about it as a holding within the etf there is that piece that we're conscious about what the valuation is and we may be making changes relative that based on valuation and so uh that is crowd strike in a nutshell and that's our uh latest episode of frontier and center on behalf of deep water bye for now
Pressure Points: Google 2Q'24 Earnings,2024-07-24 01:13:06+00:00,5,M3OYnhgj4aw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3OYnhgj4aw,[music] welcome to pressure points i'm jean mster our topic is apple earnings we're going to break it down into two pieces one is the current state of the business and second is the longer term impact of what we learned today and we'll start with the near term as far as the december quarter they did beat slightly they reported 2% revenue growth the street was looking for 1% beat earnings by a little bit overall the iphone was surprisingly strong up 6% the iphone was expected to be up about 25% china was weaker than expected it was down 133% year year uh adjusting for fx it would have been down six or 7% but that was a deceleration from down 2 and a half% in the september 23 quarter so china was a bigger headwind they more than offset it in other parts of the world and the takeaway is that the business returned to growth for the first time in a year all that goodness was was washed away when luca got to the guidance segment which the punchline is that they lowered the guidance from the street was at 1% and they gave guidance to expect revenue to be down about 5% in the march quarter so going from plus one where analyst were at to minus5 based on their guidance and not only was it a guy down but it was a little bit of confusion around it so i'll step through what happened with the guy is that the a year ago in march of 2023 apple benefited from penup demand that came from december of 2022 and the reason is that in november of 22 iphone 14 production was shut down in china because of covid so that five billion in revenue got moved from december of 23 where normally they would have seen it into march uh december of 22 into march of 23 so when they reported their march of 23 call it 95 billion in revenue it was actually had more of a tail one than we realized and i went back to the call the company did not mention it last year in march of 23 and so that would have been nice to have known because then analysts could have properly adjusted their numbers and thought about what the real number should have been for this march of 23 they would have known that this was kind of an extraordinarily tough comp because of an extraordinary event happened the iphone production got shut down so it makes sense to me that the company wants to give some context to this and after factoring in the context the overall business is basically going to be flat year-over-year the uh piece that i wish was different was that i wish apple a year ago would have mentioned in the december quarter that excuse me the march 23 quarter that we had a great march 23 it did have a big benefit more than we realized the 5 billion in revenue that came spilling over from december of 22 because that factory shut down that would have been good to have known and my take on this and this has been consistent for all the years that i've been investing as as an analyst is just be consistent if you want to call it fx when it's negatively impact call it out when it's positively impacting if you want to call out these one time pieces when it's having a negative impact call it out when it's having a pos impact so i've said my piece apple's business adjusting for that is basically flat which gets to a bigger question related to what is apple's true growth rate so if we look at the last six quarters call it four of them previous four were down 2 and a half% now we just reported a quarter that was up 2% and this quarter if you give them the benefit of backing out that five billion is going to be flat if you take that benefit away it's down six down 5% but when you put it together it hasn't been a growing business which begs the question what's apple's underlying growth rate and i think we have some clues to that relative to what they talked about and how that impacts the longer term and there are three things i want to point out the first is related to the active install base and they break this number out once a year it was 2.2 billion uh that was up 10% year-over-year in the previous year the active install base grew at 11% which is impressive given there's a law of large numbers that was working against them the ability to grow that by 10% is a sign of strength and separately is during that time revenue was basically down 2 and a half% and what that means is that people are holding on to their apple devices longer they're continuing to use them and uh that is one of the reasons why they hold on to them longer many times it's because of macro related it also could be feature related but in total if you are sticking with apple as a platform there's a high probability that you come back and eventually upgrade and if you look at apple's market share within the high-end smartphone market they have been gaining market share globally over the last few years hit record market share and high and form market in china based on idc in the december quarter and so the franchise is intact and i would i would view that it's actually gotten stronger which is the base of why you can get back to what i think is this 5% growing business and essentially you'll have periods where the economy starts being stronger maybe there's a feature that attracts more people in and you're going to have some years that are growing 67 8% and other years that are growing 1 2 3% but when i think you level it out it's a 5% growing business we can debate about what you pay for that i think it's consistent as a consumer staple company i'd much rather own apple versus coca-cola they have similar growth rates rates right now but i think that the potential for higher growth rates with apple is on the table where some of these other consumer staples reliable businesses but don't have that upside potential and so that's number one is the active install base the second piece that caught my attention about the long term and this one is a negative is related to the impact of some changes to the app store and europe in march they are going to allow third-party app stores to be downloaded through apple's app store so you download this third party app store you go into that app store and you can download other apps when you transact with those other apps those are going to have lower fees that apple will take and it's there's a matrix on how those fees are broken down the european union requires apple break it down into three segments we won't get into that here but just say collectively is that what they're going to make the growth rate in europe in their app store will likely decline they did break out on the call that 7% of their overall app store revenue comes from the european union so the overall app store revenue if you look at the total business is about 7% of the total business so this is 7% of the 7% comes from europe which means that it's really not going to have much of an impact it is worth noting because this is something that apple didn't not want to go down this road they resisted this for good reason and there's this question about steering in the us and how that potentially could impact some of the app store in the us so in total i think of the app store is 7% of total revenue it's a highly profitable i think it's a 75% margin business and i think that what's happened in europe is worth monitoring to see if it ends up spreading to other regions and i won't worry about what's going on in europe specifically to the business because it's small with they up store but something worth watching the third piece and this is in the positive category is related to artificial intelligence and for the first time couldn't believe my ears when tim cook and his prepared remarks mentioned the letters ai and said that they will have it's important to apple and they're going to have some announcements later this year and one of my predictions for 2024 was that apple would come out with a foundation model in the june wwdc i think the probability that that happens increased tonight and that's important because apple has not been participating in generative ai they've always talked about ai in terms of making their products better fall detection text uh promoting organizing photos but they've never addressed the gen of ai opportunity and so now they're doing that and how apple has a unique opportunity i don't think they're going to have the best foundation model and this would compete with like grock and uh jet chbt gemini anthropic i don't think they'll have the best foundation model but i think they'll have a model that is great that allows a lot of utility for people specifically leveraging apple's privacy and security uh excellence and helping people do uh personalized ai with that that would be the ability to ask your device to do something resolve my electric bill help book a table what's the best snowblower i should be buying to be able to actually go through and uh to give some very clear actions and even take steps to make our lives a little bit easier that's an opportunity that is is right dead center for apple longer term i think that they can embed that in their products i think they could charge for a product that could do that this all gets back to the 5% type of a growth so uh that was on the those are the three big pieces longer term active install base some of the changes to what's going on in the app store in europe and does that go to other countries and lastly it's good news for apple that we're going to likely see a foundation model so put it all together wish the guidance was better it was negative guidance uh i do expect them to return to growth and uh we'll be getting ready to get our vision pro tomorrow and uh report back on that which uh should be mentioned as one of the other other things it does appropriately come last year because it's going to take time for this to grow but vision pro i do believe uh will eventually account for 15% of revenue i think it will take a decade to get there off to a good start with the 600 apps right out of the gate i was expecting that number to be 200 so of those about 40% of those are gaming apps and we been look back at the meta quest store about 70% of their apps are related to uh are related to gaming and so apple's making a good choice of not getting this device pigeon hold as a uh as only a gaming device they want it to be uh much more broad than that so that's also on on the ledger but that's a wrap for this episode of pressure points i'm jean bye for now
DeepTech315: Tesla Earnings / Google Earnings / SearchGPT,2024-07-25 19:44:33+00:00,15,GabBf791bdY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GabBf791bdY,"welcome to pressure points i'm jean monster our topic today is cyber truck delivery event that's an event that i've been waiting for for the past four years and the pressure point is a topic that i've been thinking about for the past two years which of course is pricing that's something that's been going up and down in the ev market over the last couple years and i couldn't wait to see what they're going to price this beast at before we get into the pressure point i just want to give some highle context about what they talked about it was about a 30-minute event the first 15 minutes of the event were spent talking about how tough of a truck it is bulletproof sides they showed uh throwing a baseball at the windows lightly throwing a baseball a nod to of course the famous metal ball four years ago uh glass did not break by the way and showed some wicked videos of the towing capacity and the speed of the most aggressive model which is 0 to 60 in 2.6 seconds that was about the first 15 minutes then the next 15 minutes we're talking or showing people picking up their their cyber trucks i think they handed off around 10 or 15 of them what was not talked about was pricing and range and so once the event ended go to the website and that gets us to the pressure point which is pricing and pricing came in higher than i thought 20 to 25% higher to be specific and they version that they're taking orders on for 2024 the it's called the cyber beast is the most aggressive version that's at $99,000 and then they have a four-wheel drive version at call it 80,000 this is before any sort of incentives or if there's some way that they can get some tax credits on these or gas savings so they're displaying a price that's slightly lower than that but consider it 99 and 100 call it and 80,000 for the tri and dual motor and then in 2025 the single motor railroad drive will be available and that's at 60,000 so cross the board 20 to 25% higher than i expected and and just as a point of comparison best comparison we have is the ford f-150 lightning lineup and they tend to be each of their versions tend to be about $10,000 less than where cyber truck is at now not a fair comp comparison because cber truck is a superior truck uh it's got range it's about 15% longer 15 20% longer has more more durable better performance all of that but when it comes to buying pickup trucks people are going to look at the f-150 they're going to look at the cyber tru and cyber trucks going to be $10,000 more so that was it related to pricing just a quick aside the range ended up coming in slightly better than i thought 330 on the high inversions and 250 on the low version that will be available in 2025 so uh next topic is what does all of this mean and i think tesla's doing the right thing by pricing this high and the reason is that they know they can't produce a lot of these vehicles i suspect in 2024 they'll be able to produce 35,000 which is uh enough that if they've got pre-orders of a million plus we'll talk about that in a second but they can price it higher to kind of capture uh the the the margin on on the few vew calls that they'll be able to deliver so makes sense that they're pricing it high which gets me to i think the substance of my view here which is that eventually pricing has to come down if they want to gain market share if they want this to be a real vehicle uh they have to bring pricing down if they don't it's going to be the model s or x all over again and the light truck market's a big market and so i think their ambitions are to eventually bring price down i suspect that's probably going to be in a couple years once they get production volumes up which improve efficiencies uh that allow them not only to u be able to lower the price but also to meet the demand that's out there so i think the the message here really with the pricing is don't expect much from cybertruck over the next two to three years and i think that 2026 is probably the year where gets a little bit more exciting with maybe 250,000 deliveries at that point well below what model y and three are this year at 8 900,000 vehicles and so this is going to be a a slow build around cybertruck and i think that uh we're probably going to see as kind of part of all this dynamic well it's it's neither here nor there but this million plus pre-orders that they have i think that probably uh reduces to below 500,000 i think uh people are going to want their 100 bucks back uh if you're curious if 500,000 people cancel their pre-order that's 50 million 5 million and they've got about 26 billion in the bank so they can definitely afford the the paying out the refunds but i'm sure that a lot of that's going to be going on in the week ahead so pressure point is price it's high than i thought i don't think it's the real price longer term i think that cybertruck has still has the ability long term to be an important part of cyber of tesla's lineup and be call kind one of the top three vehicles in terms of units i think this can be 500,000 greater long term but they got to move that price down it's just too much to hit the the sweet spot of the market as a programming note over the next week deep water myself included is going to be going out to construction sites we're going to be talking to uh construction workers about this about the price about the features uh believe me they're watching this too and i can't wait to get their feedback so it's going to come better from the horse's mouth than hearing it from mine so i'm going to wrap at that on this episode of pressure points on behalf of deep water i'm jean bye for now"
Pressure Points: Meta 2Q'24 Earnings,2024-07-31 22:39:34+00:00,6,b0o179iI6sw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0o179iI6sw,welcome to pressure points i'm jean monster our topic today is why meta is the most underappreciated mega cap in ai and before we jump into the pressure point i want to put some context around what's happened over the last six months if we rewind to fall of 2023 the narrative on wall street was that we are at a peak ai bubble and it could not get any better our belief at deep water is we are in the early stages of what is three to fiveyear bull run that will ultimately culminate in a ai bubble but since that fall if we look at some of the mega cap companies that have ai exposure they've done really well and specifically is the nasdaq during that period of last 6 months is up 15% microsoft up about 25% amd meta up call it 50% nvidia 57% and out of nowhere arm now up 807 7% surging on their december results a 50% one-day move that has gotten us there but collectively over the last six months it is clear that this ai trade train keeps moving forward we can debate now are we at the peak we don't believe we're at the peak we think we are just getting started and this is just the first layer of ai that's being built in and i think we will see more companies start to build on top of this that will further power the market higher and uh so that's just the big macro piece of ai in the market where we believe it's going now let's dive into a meta and our belief that this is an underappreciated ai opportunity and there's two pieces to this there's first the side that i would say is generally appreciated and understood by investors we're going to start there and then there's the piece that is less or not appreciated that could provide a step function in value creation so in terms of that first piece is meta's business is slowly being impacted by ai they obviously have been adding ai to help advertisers better understand ad attribution if we think back to what happened with apple and meta a couple years ago with idfa that had a negative 10% impact on meta's business at the time they talked about at using ai to help build better tools for advertisers to help them understand attribution they've been doing that they also have had added ai power tools that allow advertisers to beta test campaigns ab testing campaigns and that has allowed just the platform more welcoming to advertisers and so that we're starting to see that benefit another benefit that really hasn't started even though the products are available is on the user side of the platform so we got the advertiser side and then on the other side is the user side and that call it generally the engagement side and engagement has been doing really well for meta even withouts side of ai in the december quarter they grew their da number by 6% that da number is just over two billion people that's a hard number to grow it was growing at 5% per year over the past couple quarters so it saw a slight acceleration and so it's working on the engagement side even without really the benefit of ai but they've started at the end of the quarter to layer in some of these more ai specific products uh probably the most exciting one is emu which is an ad an image generator that sits on top of instagram basically allows you to take your own photos and do some ai to it and there other ai products including a chat bot that they've integrated and also these celebrity bots so collectively these are important because as some of them will gain traction that will increase further amount of content that's created that will increase engagement that should help with ad growth and when we put all this together is they're expected to grow at 30% in the march 24 quarter that's an acceleration from 25% in the december quarter but in total i believe that they can kind of grow their revenue by about 50% over the next couple years and so that's kind of the arc on the we'll say the we well known the better known part of meta's ai opportunity but the piece that is less appreciated is what's going on with llama and this thesis is from deep waters doug clinton i would recommend highly recommend you follow him on his substack the d lo but doug has a belief that we will start to see better appreciation around what meta can do with llama now now llama is meta's foundation model and there are about five foundation models in the world those include like chat gpt google with gemini anthropic with cloud and these are kind of the the the substance of how generative ai and general intelligence is available to the world is through these foundation models and those three that i just mentioned are all clos models and so as you're a developer and you're using chat gpt or gemini you have restrictions you can't change the underlying code which is uh a hurdle to these developers getting them to do what they want to do allowing them to do what they want to do on the other side on the open- source side of models really llama stands alone as the most widely distributed open- source model and today meta doesn't make any money on llama they just distributed out there and it's been estimated that there's been 30 mill million downloads from developers of llama over the past couple months and so this is getting some great traction but again they don't monetize it they're just putting it out there and they haven't said much about what they're going to ultimately do with llama but doug's take is that this has an opportunity for them to follow a well-traveled playbook that meta has tra used with their products in the past and that playbook is to build products that hit a billion users or better and then find ways to monetize them zuckerberg has talked about this in this past this magical billion user number a hard metric to get to but once you're there you can start to monetize and so when we think about llama it has the benefit of of course ai also the benefit of being the most widely used open- source model and its adoption is quickly growing so where this ultimately could lead to as llama continues to grow and let's say it gets to several hundred million developers or a billion users on products that are built by a couple hundred million developers but as that starts to grow potentially meta could find ways to monetize it one way they could is to release their own cloud service that would like compete with azure or google cloud or ews and in that case that would be a big deal because uh this is the first time that there uh this would be a whole new product category which also is well respected by wall street the potential around these cloud services and so check the box here for llama at a minimum they've done something that they haven't done before which is build relationships with developers for the first time microsoft apple has done that for a long time meta's never been good at developing developer relationships they're doing that now with llama that is a win in itself but this could be a much bigger win if they find ways to monetize it 2 three 5 years down the road as the number of users starts to get closer to that billion number so that's a wrap on this week's pressure points i'm jean bye for now
Pressure Points: Apple 3Q'24 Earnings,2024-08-01 23:01:54+00:00,7,2Z6gWFk8sw0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z6gWFk8sw0,welcome to pressure points i'm jean mster our topic is meta earnings we'll recap the quarter and talk about the impact on the longer term so as far as the quarter and the guidance they reported revenue that was about 2 and a half% higher than the street that was all good and it got even better when you quickly got to the guidance uh they guided revenue for the march quarter to be up at the midpoint at the midpoint it was 5% % higher than street expectations at the high end of their guidance which they usually exceed the high end of their guidance it was 9% higher so rough numbers is stocks up 15% they guided 9% higher on revenue which we'll talk more about in the longer term impact because investors are leaving more optimistic that this momentum can continue another important metric was the daily active user i'm sad that this is the last time they're going to be reporting that i've gotten to know that that metric pretty well over the last decade it was up 6% year-over-year that compares to 5% growth in the september 23 quarter 5% in the june 23 quarter and before the pandemic that number was kind of up 23% a year and so we've seen an acceleration on the daily active users that number is about a quarter of the world's population there's about 8 billion people in the world just over two billion use of facebook property daily and so i think uh that to grow that number off of a big base is testimony to how they are making their products more sticky some could say more addictive but what they're doing is working and the part that is most surprising is that what is working now there's very little impact from ai today and that impact will increase going forward so uh as far as a little bit more on the the quarter if you take the high end of their guidance range for the march quarter and you assume that they hit that they will grow revenue at about 30% in the march quarter that compares to analysts were at 25% before there is a little bit of a benefit uh about 190th of a benefit because it was an extra day this year because a leap year but overall that guidance was impressive and we're going to pause there on kind of the the near term and then shift now and talk about the longer term is that big picture here is meta is all in on ai and they're being aggressive and revving their models quickly they're open source models but revving them quickly and being aggressive at uh releasing products they've got three new products that have been released at the end of 2023 that were are slowly starting helping engagement with like a text uh chat they also have an image generator that's going to go emu into instagram and then they are have these celebrity personalities that's kind of on the engagement side but they also have better ai tools to help advertisers build campaigns and improve conversion which is one of the reasons why the revenue growth has been better and the guidance was good is because they're seeing increased conversion and it's uh fun to look back at this road that meta has had when idfa came out and apple made some changes and made it more difficult for meta to give advertisers insight into what's going on that was a negative impact on meta's advertising business they've built tools now around that that are allowing advertisers to build attribution and also more quickly try campaigns that's improving conversion we're seeing that impact and that impact is only going to increase as more of these ai products both for advertisers and for engagement start to become more prevent so that is uh stands all that aggressiveness really jumped out of i was talking to doug at deep water after the meta call and he mentioned what surprised him the most here was just the stk contrast to how google how aggressive google is and they just have been a little bit timid in terms of how aggressive they've been going after ai versus what meta and microsoft have how they've been going after it and you see it and i think that it is this should be this meta call should be a wakeup call to google to get moving or you're going to get pass when it comes to the advertising world so that's the overall impact they also talked about this ai assistant this is this idea of like personalized ai you ask ai to go and do a task for you resolve your garbage bill book tickets they didn't give any sort of definitive timing but that's kind of on their road map i don't know if they're going to be able to get away with it just given their stance on privacy but they've got two billion plus daily active users so so undoubtedly people will try their personal assistant on the i'll put this in the negative side of the category it was they continue to be committed to reality labs increasing their investment in reality labs uh it is uh notably increas in investment i think this is just going to be a tough road for meta when it comes to really competing because what they're showing with their meta headset and their uh versus what apple is showing with vision pro it is night and day from price perspective meta $500 vision pro 3500 and also from a functionality i would put even though it's seven times the price i think apple's 30 times better and so we you think about what's going on with re reality labs it's really has been pigeon hold into this gaming segment and gaming specifically we looked at the number of apps on meta quest site 71% of the apps are gaming related and of the 600 apps that are coming out at the beginning for vision pro of those there's 40% of those are going to be gaming related so apple's doing a good job of not wanting to get pigion hold as a gaming device and so that's the one negative i wish they would pull back some of their spending there uh let apple kind of run with this and further build it out zuckerberg's committed to it committed to the name meta and uh we'll see how that ultimately plays out but big picture meta has done a great job of improving engagement off of difficult numbers uh advertisers continue to embrace their platform and they haven't seen the full impact of ai which should start to have a positive impact this year on behalf of pressure points i'm jean bye for now
