        "Fully recognized, which could  support the share price.  but he also lowered to neutral  risk.  shares of tesla down 5 today.  joining us now is john murphy.  john, did i get that right?  you raised it almost $100, but  downgraded it to neutral?  >> correct.  there's a fundamental call here  and stock market call, we can  talk about.  but a lot of good news is  reasonably expected in the  stock.  and 490 is our fair value on  some of the parts basis.  and we'll look for an entry  point, particularly lower than  it is now.  >> we're at 397.  100 of upside --  >> correct.  >> sounds almost like a bicall.  but it's not?  >> we're -- we're positively  predisposed to the company, and  the potential value it will  create over time.  but remember, we upgrade the  stock when it was $170.  that was less than a year ago.  so it's an incredibly volatile  stock.  there is execution risk that  has not been taken into account  in the stock at this point.  there's a couple of things,  first, they need to launch a  low-cost model, then another  model, second half of the year.  they also need to get gsd  moving in the right direction,  as far as increased  subscribers.  they need to launch a robotaxi  fleet.  sometime this year on a testing  phase.  there's a lot to get done.  and we do think there are  potential issues.  that might view the growth on  the near term.  that's why we went to a  neutral.  >> got it.  so this, too you, is about  execution risk on those major  initiative risks that they need  to deliver?  >> correct.  on vehicle launches.  there's probably the greatest  risk.  that's something that  historically, the company has  had a hard time with, as there  haven't been that many new- vehicle launches.  this is somewhat new to them of  the x, x, 3ny, none of those  have gone well in the past.  i think the second level is  around sd.  and recognition of the  consumer.  i think once you've driven in  an fs2, paying $92 a month is  kind of a no-brainer.  but advancing in technology to  full autonomy, which is what  you'll need for full robo may  take longer.  i think on the hardware ide,  you might have small  disappointments.  and on the software side, you  may have?  , you know, misses relative to  expectations as well.  >> you're also talking about,  how if they were to do, for  instance, a capital raise, that  would be a positive.  i know it might be a near-term  negative for the stock.  but even a step like that might  be necessary to  cackle some of these launches.  >> if you put on your cfa hat,  as you just did.  5%.  that is 5% dilution.  that's not necessarily good for  a stock.  but if you're raising $65%.  and using that money to, you  know, to ramp up your compute  power and your capability  around fsd.  then your new product launches.  i think most growth investors  would like that.  and for that reason, i think ",

        "Saying he wouldn't on an  economic deal to happen.  and while my next guest agrees  to some extent, he thinks trump  should take a more business- like approach.  joining me is someone who spent  a lot of time there in  greenland and knows a thing or  two about national security.  former navy admiral stavridis.  >> let's back up and look at  history here.  in 1867, we bought alaska.  probably the best deal we've  ever made.  we bought from russia.  around that same time, kelly,  we had at least a good offer on  the table to buy greenland.  didn't work out.  flash forward to 1917.  the u.s. Virgin islands, where  many of us have vacationed  quite happily.  where did we get them?  we bought them from denmark.  so it's not crazy to think  about some aspects of getting  real engagement in greenland.  but the idea of simply invading  it, which would be  at that  at  that  tat amount.  there hasn't been a big  operation.  let's get engaged, let's do  business with them final  thought here, kelly.  the prime minister of greenland  said, greenland is not for  sale.  >> right.  >> but we're open for business.  let's take him at his word.  >> so the experts say, this  would give us access to the  northern sea route, which is  controlled by russia.  that greenland has rare earth.  it has uranium.  so there are some student  opportunities there.  one question -- would it be a  territory, if it became part of  the u.s.?  and does that mean they can  act?  what can they access?  of america?  do they get access to social  security and welfare system?  or is it not all of that?  >> it would depend on the way  in which we acquired it.  so if we purchased it outright,  and if the greenlanders, and  there's only 56,000 of them,  think about this for a minute.  greenland is three times the  population of texas and has a  population just over 3,000.  but if they were to acquies in  it.  you could see puerto rico,  commonwealth.  you could see an association,  which is what we have with  marshall island.  we could structure a way in  which to bring them into the  fold but realistically, kelly,  i don't think the greenlanders  want to join up with us.  i don't think denmark wants to  walk away from them.  let's bring it together.  construct economic incentives.  if we do that, we'll get the  geopolitical access we want.  >> it's a fascinating  discussion to have.  you go back to where the u.s.  made land purchases, and  expanded territory.  but if there is a specific  interest.  and many made the time.  how would you imagine that they  are taking this news, when they  see trump literally talking  about greenland or the panama  canal or chinese interactive?  what do you think they think  about all of this?  >> i think they have two  reactions.  one is, it's good for them in  the sense that we're always  critical about putin using  military force to take over  ukraine.  we're very critical about the  idea of china using military  force against taiwan.  so when a u.s. President, even  musingly says, well, i can't  rule out military force to take  greenland or the panama canal,  china or russia will like that,  because it puts a better light  on their actions.  on the other hand, what they  don't want is an activist,  determined, forward-leaning,  chief executive, leading the  united states.",

        ".  >>> WELCOME BACK TO THE  EXCHANGE.  SOME SURPRISING NEWS THIS  MORNING.  VENUE, THE JOINT SPORTS  STREAMING VENTURE, BETWEEN  DISNEY, FOX.  IT HAS BEEN CALLED OFF.  THE DISNEY FUBO DEAL JUST  EARLIER THIS WEEK, HAD SETTLED  A LAWSUIT KEEPING THE VENUE  FROM THE LAUNCH.  SO YOU THOUGHT, FINALLY, IT'S  CLEAR SAILING.  THAT MAKES THIS DECISION OUT OF  LEFT FIELD.  FOR MORE ON THE MEDIA.  LET'S BRING IN NEEDHAM  ENTERTAINMENT SPECIALIST, LAURA  MARTIN.  AM I MAKING TOO MUCH OF IT?  >> OF COURSE NOT.  IT'S ENTERTAINMENT MARKET.  I WOULD SAY, THE MINUTE DISNEY  BOUGHT 50% DE FACTO.  I THINK WHAT THEY WERE TELLING  YOU IS, THEY ARE, AND THEY GAVE  UP 30% OF HULU LIVE.  THEY WERE TELLING YOU, THEY'RE  DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM THE  VIRTUAL MVP.  LIKE CATEGORY AND THEREFORE  LINEAR TV.  IT'S JUST ANOTHER STEP SHOWING  THEY'RE MOVING TOWARD  STREAMING.  100%.  BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO  LAUNCH THE ESPN APP, WHICH IS A  STREAMING APP IN THE FOURTH  QUARTER.  S OKAY.  >> SO THEY ARE TELLING YOU,  THEY ARE ABANDONING THE LINEAR  TV ECOSYSTEM, INCLUDING VIRTUAL  MVPs.  >> I THINK I UNDERSTAND.  BUT THE TERMS MAKE ME CONFUSED.  SAY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ONE MORE  TIME, BUT WITHOUT SAYING  VIRTUAL MVPs?  >> BASICALLY, SPORTS IS MOVING  TO STREAMING, RIGHT?  AND ESPN IS GOING TO BE THE  NEXT NAIL IN THE COFFIN OF  LINEAR TV.  BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO OFFER A  STREAMING ESPN.  DISNEY WANTS TO DO STREAMING.  IT DOESN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING  IN LINEAR.  AND WHAT VEGNU VENU.  >> AND I THOUGHT.  LOOK AT THE WAY WE'RE WRITING.  IT SAYS, VENU, STREAMING VV  CALLED OFF.  BUT IT WAS NOT STREAMING,  STREAMING.  >> IT WAS STREAMING WITH LINEAR  TV AND HAD 20-MINUTE AD LOWS,  WHICH THE CONSUMER DOESN'T  WANT.  IT WAS A WAY TO OFFER A SKINNY  BUNDLE FOR LINEAR BUT IT WAS  PREDICATED ON LINEAR TV.  AND DISNEY SAID, WE'RE OUT.  WE'RE GOING INTO THE APP WORLD,  WHERE YOU CAN WATCH ON AN APP.  STOP AND START PROGRAMMING.  WE CAN PUT SPORTS ON THERE.  AND IT'S JUST GOING TO BE US,  DISNEY.  WE'RE NOT DOING JOINT VENTURES  ANYMORE.  >> WHERE THEY ACQUIRED FUBO, IS  FUBO A STREAMING PLAY OR STILL  LINEAR TV PLAY.  >> STILL A LINEAR TV PLAY.  >> SO WHAT WAS THE POINT OF  THAT, THEN?  I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT OF  THAT ACQUISITION WAS TO SETTLE  FUBO'S LAUNCH OF THE VENU.  >> NO.  I THINK IT'S TO OFF LOAD THE  MANAGEMENT OF THE -- CALL IT A  SKINNY BUNDLE.  THE LINEAR TV ASSETS TO DAVID  GANDLER.  BUT DISNEY IS LIKE, WE'RE DONE.  WE DON'T WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT  ANYMORE.  WE WANT TO DO STREAMING ONLY,  WITH APPS IN AN APP STORE ON  MOBILE DEVICES.  THAT THE SUPER INTERESTING.  I APPRECIATE WALKING ME THROUGH  THIS.  THE QUESTION BECOMES, THESE  DYNAMICS HAVE SHIFTED IN THE  PAST FEW MONTHS.  IT WAS SUPPOSED TO LAUNCH THIS  PAST FALL.  IT'S ONLY JANUARY.  MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED  INCREDIBLY QUICKLY.  AND THEY MUST SEE SIGNIFICANT  UPSIDE.  P IF I'M AN INVEST, I GO, WELL,  THERE'S STILL KIND OF A LINEAR  CASH COW.  STREAMING IS A TOUGHER  COMPETITION.  AND I COULD SEE INVESTORS BEING  A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT THAT.  >> YES, BUT I THINK, LOOK.  COMPANIES HAVE TO MAKE -- A  GREAT CEO MAKES A STRATEGIC  CALL, AND BOB IGER IS MAKING  IT.  HE IS MAKING THE CALL THAT  STREAM SUGGEST FUTURE AND  LINEAR IS DYING.  HE'S GOING TO GET ON AND MAKE  IT HAPPEN.  HE'S THE BIGGEST SPORTS  BROADCASTER.  AND HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT  AVAILABLE ON AN APP ON ALL  MOBILE DEVICES, ASK YOU'RE NOT  GOING TO NEED YOUR CABLE BOX.  >> WARNER BROTHERS IS DOWN  NEARLY 5%.  I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR  TOP SPOT, WHICH IS ROKU.  AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S PART  OF THE STORY.  >> NO.  NOT PART OF THE STORY.  WE REALLY LIKE -- WE THINK  CONSOLIDATION HAS TO HAPPEN IN  MEDIA.  AND WE'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT  TRUMP, DOJ, AND FTC WILL BE  MORE PRODUCTIVE.  THE FACT THAT WALMART BOUGHT  VISIO, WHICH IS LINKING  TELEVISION ADS TO PURCHASES.  WE THINK ROKU IS IN A GOOD SPOT  WITH ITS 85 MILLION HOMES OF  INSTALLED BASE.

        "IT'S BEEN FEELING THE PAIN.  ONE OF THE STRONGER AREAS IN  RECENT YEARS.  NOW PERHAPS NOT HAPPY THAT IT  IS RAISING AGAIN.  >>> PROSPECT OF HIGHER RATES.  NEXT GUEST SAYS IT'S THE  BIGGEST RISK TO MARKETS,  WITHOUT SOFTER EMPLOYMENT DATA,  WE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE  HIGHER.  AND EQUITIES WILL CONTINUE TO  STRUGGLE.  HERE WITH ME NOW IS CHIEF  STRATEGIST PIPER SANDLER.  >> THANKS IF ARE HAVING ME.  WE HAVE THIS SORT OF OMINOUSLY  TICKING OVER OUR SHOULDER.  NOT A HUGE DEAL.  BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE  BIGGER STORY HERE?  >> IT'S RATE.  IT'S BEEN RATES.  AND IRONICALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT  MARKET BREADTH, THAT PEAKED IN  SEPTEMBER.  WHERE IT BOTTOMED OUT.  AS BOND YIELDS HAVE CREPT  HIGHER.  BEGINNING WITH RATE INCENTIVES.  THEN REMEMBER, DECEMBER, BREATH  STARTED BECOMING FOCUS.  AND NOW IT'S ENGULFED THE  ENTIRE MARKET.  WE THOUGHT FOUR AND A HALF WAS  THE LINE IN THE SAND WHERE WE  BECOME MORE SYSTEMIC.  AND NOW WHAT YOU'RE SEEING  BEHAVIORALLY FROM INVESTORS IS  PEOPLE ARE EXTRAPOLATING.  TALKING ABOUT THE RATE HIKES.  10-YEAR GOING UP 5, 6%.  >> THE CRAZY THING TO ME IS TO  SAY, LOOK.  WE'RE AT 476.  THE HIGHEST WE'VE GOTTEN IN THE  CYCLE IS 5.4.  WE'RE WITHIN 30 BASIS POINTS  NOW.  NOW, THAT HIGH WAS A HIGH --  I'M NOT SURE IF IT CAME BEFORE  OR AFTER THE SILICON VALLEY  PROBLEMS.  BUT SEEMED TO BE A HUGE HEAD  WIND THE FIRST TIME AROUND.  SECOND TIME, THERE ARE A LOT OF  PARTS OF THE MARKET THAT AREN'T  HOLDING UP.  BUT DOESN'T IT ALL FEEL LIKE  THE SAME LEVEL OF SERIOUSNESS  THAT WE SAW A YEAR AND A HALF,  TWO YEARS AGO?  >> YEAH.  THAT WAS AROUND SEPTEMBER OR  OCTOBER OF 2023, WHERE WE GOT  THE 5% ON THE 10-YEAR.  THE BIG SHOCK WAS IN 2022, WHEN  RATES WERE REALLY LOW AND THERE  WASN'T A LOT OF INFLATION RISK  PRICE ON THE MARKETS.  VALLEY WAS HIGH.  CREDIT SPREAD WAS TIGHT.  SOMEWHAT OF A CREDIT EQUITY  BACKDROP AND RISK BACKDROP  COMING INTO THIS YEAR.  THE RISK AS I SEE IT, AS LONG  AS RATES ARE GOING HIGHER FROM  WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SYSTEMIC  LEVEL, THE EQUITIES ARE GOING  TO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE.  I THINK ESSENTIALLY, EQUITIES  AND BONDS ARE THE SAME THING  RIGHT NOW.  >> WELL, YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT  THAT BACK IN 2022, WE WENT FROM  0.5% IN 2020.  AND DID SO.  NOW PEOPLE ARE USED TO RATES  WHERE THEY ARE.  DOES IT MAKE THAT MUCH OF A  DIFFERENCE, FROM MAYBE CUTTING  TWICE ON HOLDING THEM STEADY OR  HIKING A LITTLE BIT?  >> IT'S NOT ONLY INTEREST  RATES.  IT'S THE DOLLAR.  THE DOLLAR HAS BEEN MORE  CORRELATED TO THE 10-YEAR, THAN  ANY POINT IN THE LAST 40 YEARS.  THE DOLLAR IS AT AN ALL-TIME  HIGH TODAY.  WE LOOK AT A TRADE-WEIGHTED  BROAD DOLLAR.  IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE TO GET  USED TO RATES.  IT'S THE EXPECTATIONS, WHERE WE  HAVE TO GET ALL OF THESE RATE  CUTS.  PAIRING THAT BACK.  IT'S SENTIMENT.  CAN THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING  EQUITIES MOVE AROUND.  NOT BECAUSE EARNINGS HAVE  RADICALLY CHANGED BUT BECAUSE  SENTIMENT HAS CHANGED.  >> WHAT DO YOU DO?  THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO  COME ON THIS SHOW AND SAY I  WANT TO STICK WITH MAG 7. BUT  IF THIS PERSISTS, SOUNDS LIKE  THAT'S THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN.  >> FUNDAMENTALLY PERHAPS.  WHAT WE'VE SEEING ON A DAY LIKE  TODAY IS THE LOW QUALITY, HIGH- BETA, NO PROFIT STUFF IS  GETTING HIT.  AND A LOT OF EXPENSIVE STOCKS  ARE GETTING HIT.  IN ADDITION TO THE RATE.  OUR OUTLOOK IN 2025, WE'RE  ACTUALLY, I WOULD SAY, MORE  CONSTRUCTIVE ON THE ECONOMY  THAN WE ARE ON THE STOCK  MARKET.  AND WITH THE VIEW THAT IF  THINGS GET A LITTLE BETTER OR  STAY GOOD, RATES ARE GOING TO  STAY HERE OR MOVE HIGHER.  OF COURSE, WE HAVE THE CARDS OF  TARIFFS AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE  IS TO COME.  OUR VIEW IS THEY STILL PRICE  OUT.  AND NOW WE'RE PRICING THAT RISK  BACK IN.  AND THAT SHOWS UP IN THE FORM  OF LOWER P.E.s.  >> YOU'RE STAYING AWAY FROM  SMALL CAPS THEN?  >> YEAH.  SMALL CAPS DON'T HAVE EARNINGS.  >> ESPECIALLY IF RATES STAY UP  WHERE THEY ARE NOW.  >> THE ONLY REASON IS BECAUSE  THEIR P.E.s WENT FROM 11.  USING THE S&P600.  FROM 11 TO 17.  BASICALLY BY THE ELECTION.  ALL OF IT HAS BEEN MULTIPLE  EXPANSION ON THE VIEW THAT  RATES ARE GOING TO COME DOWN.  WE'RE GOING TO GET BETTER  GROWTH.  RATES STAYING OUT LONGER,  PUSHES OUT THAT HIGHER  LIKELIHOOD OF PICKUP AND SMALL  CAP EARNINGS.  >> IN A NUTSHELL.  DO YOU RECOMMEND?  I KNOW YOU SAID HIGH STOCKS IN  TROUBLE.  IS IT THE MAG STOCK YOU STICK  WITH?  OR SORT OF THE HIGH QUALITY AND  THOSE KIND OF NAMES?  >> REAL QUICK.  WE SEE SOME BETTER  IMPROVEMENT IN MANUFACTURING.  IT'S ALREADY STARTED.  THAT SHOULD GIVE US BETTER  EARNINGS BREATH.  SO I THINK WE HAVE BEEN REALLY  LEANING INTO GROWTH FOR THE  LAST TWO YEARS.  WE'RE LOOKING MORE FOR QUALITY  VALUE, VERSUS QUALITY GROWTH  THIS YEAR.  >> YOU'RE WILLING ",

        "Similar to and despite this one- two data punch.  my next guest says she is still  expecting to rate cuts.  joining me now is diane swan.  welcome to you both.  diane, there are some firms.  i think bank of america now  expects no rate cuts this year.  make the case.  >> well, i actually can't make  a strong case for two rate  cuts.  we have a couple of scenarios.  and one of them only has one  rate cut with a very low  probability of that actually  occurring, depending on the  outlook for tariffs.  and you're seeing that in  consumer reaction to tariffs  both in december and early  january.  as you pointed out, the  consumer sentiment sort of  expectations of front-running  tariffs, which is its own self- fulfilling prophecy.  that will push prices up.  so that's something we're  watching very closely.  so it really is dependent on  policy, and where we go from  here.  that said, this was a great  employment report that is good.  it does contradict some other  private sector reports that  showed a more cooling in the  labor market during the month  of december.  so one month does not a trend  make.  and i think some of the market  reaction is a little bit too  overly weighted on how much  inflation is embedded in that  employment report.  >> especially.  and we'll get into this maybe a  little later on.  but if a lot of this is on the  expectation of tariffs.  last time around, they were a  little contractionary.  but what were those points,  diane, that you see, that tell  us, there's other signs of a  labor market that is actually  softening?  i'm curious?  >> so what we've seen is, you  know, the hiring rate has  fallen precipitously.  the reason we've not seen a lot  of increase in unemployment is  that layoffs are also low.  that's good.  the quit rate has fallen.  now, in the month of december,  suggested a reversal of that.  but one month does not a trend  make.  that's great if it is the  beginning of a new trend, but  also bad in terms of a  reacceleration, and  potentially, wages being to the  point of it being worrisome for  the fed.  i think other weakness we're  seeing in other indicators,  everything any the adp report,  to the hiring index, a lot of  these realtime indicators, that  have been closely correlated  with the overall labor market  conditions, have now, in this  month, broken apart.  so it's hard to sort of square  that.  and i think the one concern i  have is that some of what we're  seeing is also because the  holiday season was all  compressed into the month of  december.  we saw hiring by retail, not in  november.  but in december.  because of that later-than- usual holiday season.  it was a good holiday season  and a strong end to the year.  that is good news for the  consumer.  it is somewhat worrisome for  the fed, especially given how  many people were on vacation,  during the survey week, which  was before a record holiday  travel season.  >> steve, where are you  watching?  >> i want you to reread the top  of the show.  we were so glum about 256,000  jobs.  and the unemploy sment rate  sank by a tenth to 4.1%, with  exuberance, ms. Evans.  these are good numbers.  plus, you just heard what diane  said about the retail, holiday  shopping was good.  i think what the market is  coming off of.  i have a theory on this.  the market thought it was going  to get a freebie.  thought it was going to get  strong economic growth and fed  cut.  you're not going to get your  cake and eat it, too.  the market is coming to terms  with that.  the question is, is the fed too  loose?  i don't think so.  hiconversation with people in  san francisco.  >> even before this report came  out.  yeah. And whether or not the fed  ought to have cut.  i think there's still a case to  be made for the fed to be on or  around where it is now.  quarter up, quarter down, i  don't know.  we had ghouls bee on today.  >> he didn't walk it back  really.  >> he didn't walk it back.  still continuings the fed will  be a fair bit lower.  \"fair bit\" is the term he used  in 12 to 18 months.  i think the market  is coming  to terms with it is going to be  a higher rate.  or even a higher neutral rate.  as you know, productivity is  higher.  you have this potential boom.  there's some people that  thought they looked at the  numbers this morning.  joe was one of them.  he thought he maybe saw a trump  boom in the numbers.  i talked to other economists  about that.  >> i noticed that manufacturing  was negative.  >> that is something you would  have expected to be high er.  >> in the long run?  if you look at the jobs i put  together, guys in the back,  you'll see -- they're so good  in the back.  >> there's that retail number.  >> some of the likely suspects  in there.  70,000 are if health.  so retail -- i'm sorry, leisure  and hospitality.  retail was higher.  state and local government,  that's been a big source, and  there's that manufacturing  number, reading your mind,  kelly.  putting that on there.  >> because it jumps out.  that's not a great sign.  >> it would be",

        ">>> ALL RIGHT.  WE'RE DOWN TO SEVEN AS YOU SEE  ON THE DOW.  WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT DELTA.  BUCKING TODAY'S TREND.  TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.  NEAR 10%.  JIMMY, I'LL GIFF  GIVE THIS TO  YOU.  STRONG RECORD.  HIGH OUTPUT.  WHAT DO YOU THINK?  >> I THINK ALL THINGS ARE GOING  RIGHT IN DELTA.  ONE OF THE THINGS I LOOK AT IN  EARNINGS REPORT IS WHAT IS THE  LEVERAGE.  THEY PAID DOWN $3.6 BILLION IN  NET DEBT LAST YEAR.  PROBABLY GOING TO DO ANOTHER  THREE BILLION.  WHAT DOES THIS MATTER?  THIS IS THE MULTIPLE IN WHICH  IT COULD RERATE.  THIS COULD GO TO A 10 MULTIPLE  OR HIGHER.  THE GUIDANCE THAT ED BASTION  GAVE IS $7.35 THIS YEAR.  HE'S LOW-BALLING IT.  HE KNOWS BETTER.  >> LOW-BALLING?  HE SAID THIS IS GOING TO BE  THEIR BEST YEAR EVER.  >> YEAH.  IT LOOKS THAT WAY.  BUT WE KNOW THIS IS AIRLINE  INVESTORS, THINGS CAN GET OUT  OFIOLE.  YOU THINK OF FUEL PRICES, MAYBE  THEY GOHIGHER.  MAYBE THERE'S A TURN DOWN IN  THE FUEL.  THEY OWN THE REFINERY.  >> IT IS THE BEST OF THE  AIRLINES.  UNEQUIVOCALLY, THE BEST OF  AIRLINES.  THIS SHOULD TRADE AT 10 TIMES  MULTIPLE OR HIGHER.  I THINK THEY'RE LOW-BALLING THE  EARNINGS ESTIMATE.  PROBABLY $7.50.  >> $4 BILLION IN FREE CASH  FLOW, WHICH WOULD BE 18%  HIGHER.  FORGET THAT IT'S AN AIRLINE.  HOW MANY S&P 500 AIRLINES CAN  YOU SAY THAT ABOUT?  NOT MANY.  >> I THINK WHAT THEY HAVE DONE  BETTER THAN ANY OTHER AIRLINE  IS FOCUS ON THE SERVICE OF THE  CUSTOMER.  >> ABSOLUTELY.  >> OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS,  THAT WAS LOW-HANGING FRUIT FOR  THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY.  THEY'VE EMBRACED THAT.  >> I'M ALMOST THERE.  >> YOU'RE GOING TO TORONTO,  FLAY CANADA.  I WAS AS SKEPTICAL WHEN THE  RULES TOOK THE STRATEGY INTO  THESE AIRLINE NAMES.  I WAS AS SKEPTICAL AS ANY  POSITION THAT WE'VE EVER HELD.  AIRLINES, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  BUT UNITED AIRLINES.  DELTA AIRLINES.  KUDOS, JIMMY.  YOU'VE NAILED THESE ALL THE WAY  UP.  THEY HAVE PERFORMED, THEY HAVE  WORKED WELL.  WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT IT IS,  I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE IMPACT  ON INFLATION ON BUSINESS  CONSUMERS.  >> I WAS GOING TO SAY, YOU ALL  ARE WAXING POETIC HERE.  WHAT ABOUT US?  LOOK AT THE STOCK CHART?  LOOK AT UNITED OVER 12 MONTHS?  >> THAT'S THE BEST PERFORMER.  >> JET BLUE.  THIS IS ABOUT THESE.  JET BLUE HAS THE WORST RECORD  OF ON-TIME DEPARTURES OF THE  AIRLINES.  REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS THE  STARTUP?  YEAH, EXACTLY.  I WANT TO BE CAREFUL HERE.  I DO THINK THERE HAS BEEN A  FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE  AIRLINE INDUSTRY.  THE BIGGEST THING WAS  RESTRUCTURING THE CABIN.  THIS WAS ALL ABOUT BUSINESS  TRAVEL, CHARGED MULTIPLE  THOUSANDS TO GET ACROSS THE  COUNTRY.  NOW IT'S NOT THAT ANYMORE.  IT'S A THOUSAND PLUS, TO GET  INTO THAT PREMIUM SELECT.  THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE MAKING  MONEY.  AND I HAVE TO GIVE THEM CREDIT.  GO BACK FOUR YEARS AGO.  IN THE HEART OF THE PANDEMIC.  PEOPLE SAID, THESE REMEMBER  DEAD BUSINESS TRAVELERS.  THEY FIGURED IT OUT.  KUDOS TO THEM.  >>> RECORD HIGH FOR STOCK  TODAY.  YOU OWN IT.  >> I DO.  WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS THE OTHER  DAY, WHEN THE STORY BROKE.  >> YEAH, THE STOCK WAS DOWN  THEN.  >> THE STOCK WAS 229 AT THE  TIME AND WE TALKED ABOUT THAT  BEING AN OPPORTUNITY.  I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING  REALLY IMPORTANT FOR INVESTORS  TO UNDERSTAND.  AND THAT IS THAT THE UTILITY  SECTOR IN 2024, AWAKENED.  AND IT AWAKENED IN A MAGNITUDE  AS IT RELATES TO INVESTOR  OPPORTUNITY, THAT THAT SECTOR  HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE.  AND I THINK IT'S A SECULAR  STORY.  I THINK NOW, INVESTORS HAVE TO  UNDERSTAND THAT THE UTILITY  SECTOR IS PART OF THE A.I.  STORY.  AND THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO  PLAY OUT NOW.  >> I THINK IT'S WELL KNOWN NOW.  >> IN A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS I  HAVE HAD WITH ADVISERS, IN  2024.  WHEN I TALK ABOUT UTILITIES,  AND I SAY, YOU NEED TO OWN  UTILITIES, THEY'LL SAY, THIS IS  JUST A ONE-YEAR FAD.  THEY'RE JUST REACTING TO  PARTNERSHIPS LIKE WE SAW WITH  CONSTELLATION AND MICROSOFT.  I THINK THIS IS A BIG STORY  THAT IS GOING TO PLAY OUT IN  THE COMING YEARS.  AND I THINK THAT HAVING  UTILITIES IN YOUR PORTFOLIO IS  NOT SOMETHING WHICH IT'S BEEN  IN THE PAST, WHERE IT'S  SOMETHING YOU DISMISSED.  >> WYNN RESORTS.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT ON THIS  STOCK.  >> IT HAS BEEN A BIG  DISAPPOINTMENT.  AND I WAS TALKING TO PATSY, THE  PRODUCER THIS MORNING.  AND SHE IS SAYING IT'S UNDER  REVIEW.  YES, IT'S UNDER REVIEW.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO  GENERATE FABULOUS OPERATING  REPORTS AND IT STINKS.  I AM GOING TO GO BACK TO.  GOING BACK TO IT, I LOOK  FORWARD.  THESE OPERATING RESULTS SEEM  LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO GO ORDER  FORWARD.  THE DUBAI OPERATIONS THAT  SHOULD START NEXT YEAR.  AND I THINK THAT IT'S PRETTY  SOON THAT ALL OF THIS WILL GET  PRICED INTO THE STOCK.  I CAN'T TELL YOU THE EXACT  TIMING.  BUT THE OPERATIONAL RESULTS ARE  THERE TO KEEP ME IN THE NAME.  >> SWEET GREEN.  UPGRADED AT DUBAI TODAY.  YOU SOLD IT IN NOVEMBER.  AND THE STOCK IS DOWN ALMOST  20% SINCE THEN.  YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?  >> WHEN I SOLD IT.  I SAID IT WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF  HOW MUCH IT HAD RUN.  UNDERSTAND ON TRADES, I'M  USUALLY ROLLING THE STOCKS  HIGHER.  I'M REVIEWING THE STOCKS EACH  FRIDAY.  DOESN'T MEAN IT'S OFF MY  SCREEN.  DOESN'T MEAN IT'S OUT OF THE  QUESTION FOR ME TO GET BACK IN.  I'M JUST NOT CURRENTLY IN.  I THINK THERE ARE SOME  INTERESTING ASPECTS OF THE  STORY, INCLUDING ROBOT SALAD  MAKERS, WHICH, IF YOU WANT TO  GO SEE ONE, I THINK THE ONE AT  110 PLAZA IN NEW YORK.  YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE THIS  THING CHURNING OUT, LIKE 100  SALADS AN HOUR.  >> IF YOU POP IN THERE BEFORE  THE NEXT.  >> I'M NOT A BIG SALAD GUY,  SCOTT.  I'M GOING TO GO CC AMMO.  >> SWEET GREEN.  HAS UPS AND DOWNS.  CURRENTLY IN A DOWN.  I DON'T OWN IT CURRENTLY.  WHAT ABOUT B SX?  THAT'S BOSTON SCIENTIFIC AT  DEUTSCH.  187.  SO THIS IS A STOCK, AND WE  OFTEN TALK ABOUT THIS ON THE  SHOW.  YOU WANT TO LOOK AT RELATIVE  PERFORMANCE.  YOU WANT TO LOOK AT AN  INDIVIDUAL STOCK, VERSUS THE  SECTOR.  WHAT DOES THE PERFORMANCE LOOK  LIKE?  AND IN A YEAR OF 2024, WHERE  HEALTHCARE UNDERPERFORMED, YOU  SAW BOSTON SCIENTIFIC ACTUALLY  OUTPERFORM, ALONG WITH  INTUITIVE SURGICAL.  WE OWN BOTH OF THOSE NAMES IN  THE ETF.  KEEP MENTIONING WHAT ADAM  PARKER TALKS ABOUT, PLAYING  INTO HEALTHCARE.  AND I THINK WHERE WE ARE TODAY,  JANUARY 10th, AFTE",

        "REPORTEDLY SET TO ANNOUNCE A NEW SET OF LAST MINUTE EXPANSIVE  CHIP EXPORT RESTRICTIONS TODAY. IT'S A THREE TIERED SYSTEM THAT  WOULD PUT NEW CAPS ON AI CHIP  CURBS DEPENDING ON THE CHIP AND  COMPANY. DIEDRA BOSA HAS MORE. EXPLAIN THIS FOR US, PLEASE. >> I WILL. I'M ALSO GOING TO ASK HOW  SUCCESSFUL HAVE THE CURRENT  RESTRICTIONS BEEN? THE BAN DID PREVENT CHINA FROM  GETTING THE HIGHEST BID ON CHIPS BUT DID NOT NOT STOP THEM FROM  CATCHING UP IN THE AI RACE. DESPITE THEM NOT HAVING ACCESS  TO THE BEST PERFORMING GPUs,  THEY WERE ABLE TO BUILD A MODEL  THAT BEAT THEM ON BENCHMARKS. THAT JUST SHOCKED THE AI  COMMUNITY. HERE'S WHAT PERPLEXITY CEO TOLD  ME. >> BUT THE REALITY IS SOME OF  THE DETAILS IN DEEP CP3 ARE SO  GOOD THAT I WOULDN'T BE  SURPRISED IF META TOOK A LOOK AT IT AND INCORPORATED SOME OF  THAT. RIGHT. >> SO ADVANCED THAT OUR BEST  AMERICAN COMPANIES COULD USE IT  AS A BLUEPRINT. THAT IS A SHOCKING STATEMENT. IN OTHER WORDS, THE EXISTING  CHIP RESTRICTIONS DID NOTHING TO SLOW DOWN CHINA'S PACE. THEY ONLY MADE THEM MORE  CREATIVE AND EFFICIENT. THEY'RE MAKING MORE STRIDES IN  EFFICIENCY WITH LIMITED  RESOURCES. THERE'S 01.AI AND ALIBABA'S. THE EXPORT BAN ON CHINA HAS ALSO LED TO SMUGGLING AND LOOPHOLES. A REPORT SAID THAT BYTEDANCE AND OTHER CHINESE COMPANIES RENTED  HIGH-END GPUs TO GET AROUND  RESTRICTIONS. ANOTHER REPORT FROM REUTERS SAID TSMC CHIPS WERE FOUND ON  A HUAWEI PRODUCT. CREATIVITY IN A DIFFERENT SENSE  FORCED AGAIN BY THOSE  RESTRICTIONS. BEGS THE QUESTION, BY EXPANDING  THEM, WHAT ARE YOU REALLY  ACHIEVING? THIS IS A POINT NVIDIA TOOK UP. IT CALLS THEM A LAST MINUTE  POLICY THAT WOULD PLAY INTO THE  HANDS OF U.S. ADVERSARIES. THIS IS PRETTY UNCHARACTERIST  LANGUAGE FROM NVIDIA AGAINST THE CURRENT BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. IT ALSO ECHOES AN ORACLE BLOG  POST FROM A FEW DAYS AGO THAT  SAID THAT THE EXPORT CONTROL  FRAMEWORK WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE TO EVER HIT THE U.S. TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND QUOTE SAYS WE DON'T NEED A RIDE, WE NEE",

        "Pressure. Coca-cola, ibm, uber, merck. Joining us now with his outlook  is hans nordwig. Why are we seeing this move out  of bonds and the currency? >> this week is a pretty  extraordinary week in the u.k.  because typically in an economy, you have interest rates moving  up and the currency gains and  this week, we have the opposite. We have interest rates going up  as you mentioned and powell is  selling off. This is what happens in emerging markets that you have high  yields, bond weakness, combined  with currency weakness, right? >> that's why i called it a  confidence question. >> yeah. It's like an eu type dynamic. The bank of england is  expressing concern about that. The question is what do you do  about it? if the currency is weak and you  have pressure on the bond  market, there's no simple  solution. Are you going to hike rates when the bond markets are under  pressure? so this, i think, is really an  example of 2025 i think is going to be the year when the debt  overhang that a lot of countries have is going the start to  really create new policy  challenges and i think the u.k.  is at the forefront of that. France has something similar  going on. We've had a mini currency crisis in brazil over the last month or so. Even in the u.s., we've had the  30-year surging 100 basis points since september and some of that is linked to growth like we've  had good growth numbers and  labor market numbers today. But there's also something going on with supply where on the days we don't have good u.s. Data, we have this drift. >> do you tie what's happening  in the u.k. To questions about  the government, the attacks from elon musk? the political questions and  accusations? >> i think we have a situation,  right, where there's just a lot  of countries around the world  where the fiscal situation is  very complicated in the sense  that interest rate costs for  governments are going up. And that means that the budgets  will be very pressured and  actually some of the initiatives that the government has to put  in place are viewed as taxation  will be inflationary, right? the solution to these problems  is something that creates pain  on the way in a way we've not  seen for a while and certainly  if we have instability about you know, concerns about political  instability, that will just add  to that. >> what do you think it does to  effort to bring, reign in the  budget deficit in the country,  find ways to make the government more efficient? if they're able to move the  needle say for example on this  doge entity, would that be  enough for the bond vigilantes  to the extent they are raising  their hackles? >> i think it all comes down to  growth. If we can have an okay growth  trajectory in the united states, 2.5, 3% growth, then it's going  to be okay to cut spending, have drag on growth from  consolidating fiscal accounts. If we have a situation where  growth shifts down a gear,  growth is under pressure,  unemployment is rising, then  it's going to be hard to do  those cuts because it's going to create a growth drag at a time  you don't want it. It's all down to growth. Scott bessant who you spoke  about last time, he's very, very focused on this idea of keeping  growth at 3%, right, and i think when",

        "SEVERAL COMMENTS AS YOU KNOW  ABOUT U.S. EXPANSIONISM  TARGETING CANADA, THE PANAMA  CANAL, AS WELL AS GREENLAND. PIPPA STEVENS HAS MORE ON WHY  THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IS FOCUSED  ON GREENLAND IN PARTICULAR AND  IF HIS PLAN IS POSSIBLE. >> PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP IS  EYEING GREENLAND FOR THREE KEY  REASONS. RICH MINERAL RESOURCES, ACCESS  TO GLOBAL SHIPPING ROUTES AND  ITS STRATEGIC LOCATION IN THE  ARCTIC, WHICH IS IMPORTANT AMID  RISING TENSIONS WITH RUSSIA AND  CHINA. GREENLAND HAS 25 OF THE 34  MINERALS DEEMED CRITICAL BY THE  EUROPEAN COMMISSION INCLUDING  LITHIUM AND GRAPHITE, WHICH ARE  KEY FOR EV BATTERIES AND CELL  PHONES. IT ALSO HAS RARE EARTH RESERVES  WHICH ARE CRITICAL FOR THE  ENERGY TRANSITION, MILITARY  EQUIPMENT, AND COMPUTER CHIPS. CHINA CURRENTLY DOMINATES THAT  MARKET AND WITH TERROR THREATS  AND RETALIATION, GREENLAND COULD BE ANOTHER SOURCE OF SUPPLY. THE COUNTRY ALSO HAS VAST OIL  AND GAS RESERVES. AS ICE MELTS, SHIPPING ROUTES  AROUND GREENLAND COULD BECOME  MORE ACCESSIBLE, CUTTING TRANSIT TIMES AND COSTS AND AVOIDING  BOTTLENECKS. TWO KEY ROUTES ARE ON EITHER  SIDE. THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE AND THE  ARCTIC ROUTE. RUSSIA HAS REOPENED MILITARY  BASES IN THE ARCTIC AND CHINA  WANTS TO BUILD A POLAR SILK ROAD PASSING THROUGH ARCTIC WATERS SO U.S. ACCESS IS KEY. THE U.S. HAS HAD A PRESENCE IN  GREENLAND SINCE THE EARLY '40s  AND OWNS THE BASE WHICH INCLUDES MISSILE DEFENSE AND SPACE  MONITORING. WHEN ASKED WHEN POSSIBLE TO  PURCHASE, THEY EMPHASIZED THE  COUNTRY IS NOT FOR SALE. THE PRIME MINISTER SAYING HE HAS NOT BEEN IN CONTACT WITH TRUMP,  BUT HE IS READY TO INCREASE  DIALOGUE WITH THE U.S. GUYS? >> SO JUST REMIND US. DENMARK RULES GREENLAND, RIGHT? BUT THEY WANTED TO BE  INDEPENDENT BEFORE AND THEN  THERE'S ALSO A RUSSIA COMPONENT  HERE, ISN'T THERE? >> YEAH, SO, DENMARK DOES STILL  RULE GREENLAND, BUT SINCE GOING  BACK TO 2009, THEY ESSENTIALLY  GRANTED THE OPTION FOR GREENLAND TO BECOME AUTONOMOUS THROUGH A  REFERENDUM. THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN CALLED BUT THERE IS A GREATER PUSH FOR  INDEPENDENCE, BUT IT'S TRICKY  BECAUSE THEY STILL RECEIVE ABOUT A FIFTH OF THEIR GDP FROM  DENMARK. OF COURSE, DENMARK BENEFITTING  AS A MEMBER OF THE EU. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT  IT MAKES SENSE FROM AN ECONOMIC  STANDPOINT. THEY HAVE ANOTHER ELECTION  COMING UP IN APRIL AND IN TERMS  OF THE RUSSIA ELEMENT, THEY ARE  THE ONES WHO CONTROL THE  NORTHERN SEA ROUTE. IF YOU WANT TO SEND A SHIP IN  THAT DIRECTION, YOU HAVE TO GET  PERMISSION AND PAY A TRANSIT  FEE. THEIR ENTIRE NORTHERN BORDER IS  IN THE ARCTIC AND ALSO, THEY'VE  INCREASED MILITARY ACTIVITY IN  THE KEY WATERS AROUND GREENLAND, ICELAND, AND THE U.K. THAT IS WHY IT'S SUCH A  STRATEGIC LOCATION FOR THE U.S.  BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO DO MORE  MONITORING, MISSILE DEFENSE AND  THAT TYPE OF THING.

        "That's jpmorgan's number. Business communities just  beginning to assess the total  damage and the displacement and  where to go from here. Joining us this morning, charles tortle. One of the largest residential  developers in southern  california with a total  portfolio value of more than $3  billion. Gentlemen, thanks for time  today. I know this is a difficult week  and it's a crisis very much in  motion, charles. But at this point i'm wondering  if you think the city will  emerge with a rebuilding mindset or whether people will be  looking to exit? >> it's a fluid time. What we're experiencing now is  going to be a rebuilding feeling among most of the folks that we  know and we're expecting that. And this is politics are going  to be following right behind  that we hope. We haven't had a chance to get  with them firsthand. The rebuilding is going to need  to be addressed through  hopefully an expedited process  and that's yet to be seen. >> before we can even think  about rebuilding, we're in this  crisis moment. The scale and the size of the  damage here, any of your  developments affected? >> the scale is massive. Fortunately, none of our  developments were affected by  the fires. 100 mile an hour winds, which is really unprecedented in my  lifetime. If you look at $57 billion of  economic loss, 100,000 people  had to evacuate. Another 200,000 with evacuation  orders. We had friends who lost their  homes in the palisades, the  schools, everything gone. It's very sad. While the fires were in the  palisades, altadena, hollywood,  it affected people in every  different class. Teachers, nurses, business  owners, everybody. The devastation has been  significant. >> i wonder where people are  living with so many homes  destroyed right now, i would  imagine, charles, if you have a  listing on the market in an area that was unaffected in l.a.,  like those are flying over ask. >> they are. It's really difficult, i think  now, for folks to find places to live. Apartments, hotels, they're all  full. We're getting feedback where,  you know, we're actually going  to offer some of our vacant  apartments, which are soon to be full, as a way to contribute to  the community, to the fire  victims, but it's a problem that is now emerging as people are  going far and wide now to find  places to live. >> just to add to that, you  know, you talked about couple  thousand people without a place  to live. If you look at all of west los  angeles and include all  apartments and all single family homes, there's only about 2,000  vacancies total, right, and only about 10% of that, which is  about 200 units, are three  bedrooms. There's a lot of families that  have been impacted. Just the other day, in mar  vista, a single family home was  renting for $30,000 a month. That shoul",

        "For joining us and bringing us  these updates and showing us  what it's like there on the  ground. >>> time now for the squawk  planner. A few notable earnings reports,  we will hear from delta airlines at about 6:30 and bring you an  exclusive interview with ed  bastian. Also reporting constellation  brands and walgreens. At 8:30 the december  forecasters, expected a gain of  155,000 jobs, a step down -- not steep, that would take two e, -- from the surprising 227,000  increase in november, but  roughly in line with the  four-month average. The unemployment rate expected  to hold steady at 4.2%. Joining us kevin cummins. I haven't seen other than the  proposed deregulation maybe and  some business-friendly policies, i haven't seen a lot to like  overall just in recent weeks,  six weeks, let's say. The market action, the tone from the fed, the increased worries  about sticky inflation, as well  as some worries about maybe a  slowdown. None of it seems great to me,  kevin. Are you bullish? >> well, i think we're going to  see a bit of a step down in  economic growth this year  relative to what we saw last  year, but i have to say if you  look at more recent data they've been continued resilience is  really the message. If you look at auto sales were  even higher. Next week of course we will get  an update on the consumer retail sales for december and how the  holiday shopping season, you  know, performed and then we had  pretty strong ism surveys this  week. Jobless claims are pretty close  to calendar lows last year. So i think the economic  backdrop, you know, going into  '25, if anything it's probably a little bit better. I'm pretty optimistic on today's report. You know, as you mentioned job  growth is expected to slow a  little bit relative to what we  saw in november, but, you know,  if consensus is right and  155,000 jobs are added that's  still pretty good and the  expectation is the unemployment  rate is basically at full  employment, you know, a pretty  stable level here.  >> yeah. So at this point where do you  see where we could have a  problem? with inflation staying between  2.5, 3.5% or are we -- are we  missing what could be a fairly  significant slowdown in growth? >> i think the worry in the near term is more on the inflation  side. I mean, as you mentioned, there  was a little bit of slowing in  the improvement that we saw  through '23 and into '24, you  know, inflation has gotten a  little bit stickier over the  past couple of months. I'm still pretty hopeful that  it's going to continue to move  down towards 2%, but, you know,  there are risks. There's tariff proposals  obviously that will have a new  source of upward pressure on  inflation that could emerge in  the coming year. So we will have to see how  things work out, but, you know,  i'm still -- still hopeful that  inflation continues to move  lower. I mean, we've seen good  productivity data and i think a  lot of the momentum of, you  know, the things that are likely to come on the housing side as  far as rent prices eventually  will start seeping through more  obviously into the core  inflation measures that the fed  watches pretty closely.  >> do you think the s&p goes up  this year, kevin, and is the  leadership the same? >> well, that's a little bit out of my purview, i'm an economist  so i don't have a necessarily  view on where the equity market  is going to go, but i'm pretty  optimistic more recently on  growth that i think, you know,  from a fundamental standpoint,  you know, if we see -- you know, there's certainly risks as i  mentioned on tariffs, but  there's also down side risks to  growth on trade and immigration  that could slow the economy. So we'll see -- we will have to  see how things unfold, but from, you know, a fundamental  perspective, the consumer seems  to be in pretty healthy shape,  job formation seems to be pretty solid, you know, as i mentioned, our forecast at nat west is  185,000 on today's jobs report. You know, income formation,  wages and salary growth has been running close to almost 6% in  nominal terms. That's not really much slowing  relative to where you were, say, for example, about a year ago. So consumption could hold up  pretty well this year, you know, that was the surprise last year  and it has been for a while now. So there's nothing out of the  data that we've seen in the last couple of weeks that suggests  any sort of real change in  overall tone in the labor market and as long as people have obs  it seems like they're continuing to spend at a pretty healthy  clip. Maybe down a little bit from  where we were last year, but  certainly more along the lines  of where the fed was hoping with a soft landing this year. >> kevin, very goo",

        "Steve is here post 9 with a  very special guest.  happy friday, steve.  >>  happy friday.  we are pleased to be joined by  austin, chicago fed president.  thank you for joining us this  morning.  >>  yeah.  great to see you again.  >>  i hope ru happy to be the  first guy out of the box to  talk about this jobs report  which is what, double the  estimate?  how does it make you feel about  the united states economy and i  think second of off if jobs are  -- increasingly representing a  source of potential inflation  to you?  >>  i think you will never hear  me chain we got 250,000 jobs.  it is a strong jobs report.  it makes me further comfortable  that the job market is  stabilizing at something like  the full employment rate that  as we went through the fall  last year there were some  danger signs that you had seen  the unemployment rate taking up  for a fair bit.  now that is stabilized.  it's even come down a little  bit.  i think that part is strong.  i think the -- there's still a  couple of question marks about  over indexing on individual job  months as you know we have been  up.  we have been down.  we have had hurricanes.  now we got fires.  we will have to see what that  will do for the numbers and we  had quite a strong christmas  season.  if you look in the jobs  numbers, you had a very big  positive private sector job  growth in the retail sector.  we will still have to process  through was that a sign of the  season and then will slow down  or was that a sign of general  consumer confidence and  consumer spending will remain  strong going through the  beginning of this year?  >>  austin.  the chair and others as well  have said that they do not see  the job market as a source of  inflation.  is that changing in your mind?  >>  that has not been changing  in my mind.  i don't see it as a source of  inflation.  if you look at wages for 2024.  i think the number was 3.9%  growth.  that is pretty close to  consistent given what  production has been running  with 2% inflation.  so, so far to me the job market  looks like stabilized at full  employment, not an indication  of over heating.  >>  so many things to ask you  about.  one more from me.  you have interest rates really  going the other way.  is that consistent with your  outlook and what the economy  needs?  is it something that the fed  needs to address and how do you  explain the fed cutting rates  and the long run has gone up to  strongly as it has?  >>  if you look at the long  rate for the people who say  that's because of expected  inflation that can't really  explain it.  you take the tips measures of  what inflation expectations are  that explains that most maybe a  third of what has been  happening.  i think some significant part  is factoring in that if growth  will be higher than what people  thought the feds -- the speed  at which the fed is going to be  reducing down to nuetral is  slower than what they thought  would be a more shallow rate  path if you want to call it  that.  that will affect long rates  because they are just adding up  a lot of short rates.  i think there is a -- a fair  bit of uncertainty about  policy, coupled with -- as  sarah was saying you have seen  the up tick in some business  confidence and if you think the  growth rate will be higher i  think that could be  contributing to it as well.  >>  do you still want to cut  rates this year?  >>  i -- look.  it is not what we want.  it is what will the conditions  authorize or justify?  i still think look for all of  the discussion about inflation  if you take pce inflation which  is our 2% target and you ask  over the last six months what  has it been?  it's 1.9% through all of the  bumps the inflation rate since  the bump in the first quarter  of last year we have seen  pretty stable inflation that's  been coming in around where the  target is.  even the core has come down i  think the last six months, core  is about 2.2.  if conditions are stable and we  don't have an up tick in the  inflation rate and we keep  having them come in around 2%  with stable and full employment  i think that the rates should  go down to where they -- to  what i consider to be nuetral  and 12 to 18 months from now  they would be a fair bit lower  than they are today.  the thing.  >>  so that's a yes.

        "To you by --  >> you. You did that one, steve.  >> i do it once in awhile.  >> all right. Joining us right now for  insights on what the new jobs  data could mean for the fed and  its rate decisions this year is  roger ferguson, former fed  vice-chairman, also a cnbc  contributor. Roger, tell me what the fed  thinks about this number. >> i think the fed thinks about  it exactly how you've been  talking about it which is good  news, the labor market they had  feared was softening, appears  not to be. Challenging news, you know, the  anecdote the thought that  inflation is going to continue  to come down now is very much  questioned and i think, as i  said the last time we were on,  the probability of them getting  off two cuts next year dr osh,  i'm sorry, this year seems to be very, very mud at this stage. Good news is good news and good  news is challenging news.  >> what about the news that the  ten year is now sitting at  almost 4.8%? >> i think the so year and the  bond market in general is doing  what they're supposed to do. In in this market where we're  expecting continued private  sector demand for credit,  continued government demand for  credit both in u.s. And around  the world, that way that gets  equilibrated is higher interest  rates. I think that's a reflection of  the market doing what it is  supposed to do, which is telling a supply and demand story. You will need higher rates to  bring savings into these markets and that's exactly what we're  getting. I don't think there's a way to  manage that. I think that's the outcome. Of  the way the market sees the  future.  >> one of our guests allison was mentioning this could be the new reality. Is this the new, new normal? higher interest rates? higher levels? the 30 year is almost at 5%.  >> look, i think it goes back to a point that i think joe and i  talked about a couple of shows  ago which is the allusive  so-called r star and neutral  rate higher because we have new  demands for capital, because we  have new technologies that might lead to greater productivity. So perhaps we should get used to this. Not because it's a bad thing,  but because it shows that there  is many, many productive uses of capital and hopefully that plays through into productivity  increases which allow for, you  know, companies to be more  productive. So net-net i think this probably is a new normal and we should  get used to the fact that, you  know, we're not going to see a  dramatic movement down in long  rates anytime soon. >> should we also think that a  new reality is inflation running above trend? >> i think so. One of the things i've said i  think a few times here is i've  been quite concerned inflation  actually is as sticky as it  appears to be. Some of what's driving that is  supply and demand imbalances in  housing, for example, and it's  really hard to fix that. You know, we have an  administration coming in that  seems to be leaning more towards things that appear to be likely  to be inflationary. So, you know, the 2% target may  prove to be allusive, or to put  it another way to get to the 2%  target may require the fed to  really crunch the economy and  that is a tough, tough tradeoff  for them to deal with at this  stage, i believe.  >> okay. Roger, you always speak so  plainly, that's a lot of things  that have been circulating that  they wouldn't necessarily expect to hear a former fed official  sa",

        "Normally against what we saw in  the last meeting. Back to the panel. >> okay. Thanks, rick. Let's bring in our jobs panel,  sara, ben and allison. Steve, we just -- how long ago  were you -- you were sitting  over here, that was today --  >> i was on the other side there then.  >> i told you i was -- i really  was hoping for a really crappy  number.  >> yeah.  >> and it's not so much that --  that i think that that would  mean more cuts or a likelihood  of more cuts, i just think it  would start to make you think  that we don't have to worry  about inflation so much. But when things like this are  happening, inflation, which is  already, you know -- i'm not  talking about tariffs  necessarily and i'm not talking  about immigration necessarily,  but add those in, but just where we are just from what's  remaining from what the fed was  trying to do in the first place. We weren't there yet when they  started cutting and it doesn't  seem like we're there and the  markets do not like this and  there goes the 10 year and the  30 year. Why am i wrong? >> it's like you come home and  your daughter kisses you and you say, i'm afraid you're not going to love me in the future. I mean, right now, joe, you've  got really good jobs numbers.  >> you're just arguing, you're  arguing with the markets. >> i'm not --  >> why is it happening then? just talk about what is.  >> first, you're right. You're right in the sense that  the fed had pushed aside this  notion that employment was a  potential source of inflation. These kind of numbers kind of  bring it back in the sense that  the payroll numbers themselves  are hot, unemployment rate has  been, you know, dancing around  this 4.1, 4.2 number, but i  don't want to awfulize this  number, joe.  >> you don't have to. What is the market saying? >> i am going to argue --  >> no cuts? no cuts? >> i think it's no cuts. I think that's right. But we're putting a lot of  people to work, we reduced the  number of long term unemployed,  we have a little --  >> we always look jobs. Always that argument. There's always the argument that we do want people working, we  want people getting --  >> i don't let wall street tell  me what the right number f  employment is.  >> sometimes you do. Depends on the number.  >> that is a cynical  perspective.  >> it is, but we --  >> it's good. People with jobs.  >> we face what we face. Sara, are we overheat -- are we  seeing the kind of economic  activity that would say, yes,  you were right, jay powell, to  cut and, yes, we need to  cutmore? >> well, i think, first of all,  when jay first cut by 50 basis  points in december they might  have been a little bit overly  optimistic on the view that the  employment markets were  weakening which obviously  they're not. I think there's three factors  that determine the path of the  markets from here, that is what  does the fed do, how much  tighter conditions get and  market valuations starting with  the fed. We are already down from hoping  for four rate cuts this year to  two and i think today's number  will take us well below two to  one, zero or maybe even talking  about rate hikes. Tighter conditions are an issue  for equity markets. Higher yields are a headwinds  for the market and also stronger dollar. Let's talk about market  valuations. We are currently trading at  about 90% versus history in  terms of a premium for the s&p  500. So what do we have to take us  forward from here this year? we can't rely on valuation,  expansion, we're going to need  to rely on earnings growth and  can we get that? we can probably get about 6 to  7% earnings growth on the s&p  that takes us -- for the bulls  to about 6,400 on the s&p if  everything works out just for  earnings growth which is  basically kind of what we have  to rely on here because  valuations will have a tough  time expanding through the s&p.  >> ben? >> yeah, so i think that the big number here is not the payroll  number which is coming in much  hotter than a lot of analysts  expected, but the big number  here is the u-3 and the u-6,  seeing increased tightness in  the labor market. This isn't just in isolation or  on the cusp of a new  administration, we are on the  cusp of a new administration  which has pledged a very  different immigration policy  than the one we've seen for the  past four years. I think this makes the fed's job harder. The fed will have to again start worrying about wage price  spirals and labor migration. In the absence of that this is  probably good news, more jobs  for americans, rising wages, but there is a real concern about  the labor market becoming too  tight. >> all right. Allison, from your -- from where you're sitting, what do you  think? >> i mean, i'm with steve. This is, you know, a good  report. I mean, it might not be what the market wants, but, you know, it  means people have jobs. I'm starting to just think this  is a healthy labor market and we might have to come to terms with the fact that any way inflation  isn't as low as the fed would  like, this might just be where  inflation is and where our new  equilibrium rate of inflation  which is bad news for the fed  because i think they are anxious to cut so they could tell the  story we've gotten inflation  back down to target.  >> they already cut. >> they want to keep cutting.  >> i know. They can make mistakes, allison. >> yeah, i think that's right. >> go ahead, allison. Sorry. >> well, i think they were  trying to tell the story we beat inflation, we're credible and  now it looks like that last half mile isn't going anywhere and i  think there's a lot of  inflationary pressure in the  pike next year even if the trump administration is successful it  will boost growth and  potentially inflation, too, and  that the fed might be in a bad  position of saying we've never  made our target, we were below  and above target but since we've had a target when has inflation  ever been 2? >> allison, i don't -- these  things matter is i guess what  i'm saying. If we saw -- no one is saying  we're going back to jimmy carter years and, you know, we had a  funeral yesterday, but it  matters if you don't anticipate  properly like when they stayed  at zero too long, you can make  the same mistake coming down too quickly. And that's what the markets, i  think, is thinking, not just no  cuts, but you really have --  this could be -- they could be  raising by the end of the year. >> i think that's looking  likely. I mean, like i said, i think  we're right that maybe one cut  is the best case scenario and i  think that's highly unlikely,  unless, this would be worse,  there is a big economic shock  that causes a recession, then  they would probably cut but i  don't think anybody wants that.  >> the b",

        "Higher wages and that all feeds  through into higher prices. >> all right. Here we go. Nonfarm payrolls for the month  of december on our jobs, jobs,  jobs report, way hot, 256,000.  >> wow.  >> what a shocker. 212,000 on last week's revised  227,000, but let's look at two  weeks' worth. If we get two weeks' worth of  revisions we are looking at down 8,000, down 8,000. Now, 256, we have to see when  that comps to. That would be the comp of march  of last year when it was  310,000. Which means it would be the  second best basically going back to that point. Now, let's look at some of the  important internals, shall we? average hourly earnings up 0.3,  up 0.3. We break that -- up 0.4, up 0.4  was what we had been running. If you look at the average  hourly earnings year over year  we broke the 0.4, we are now  down to 3.9 which in some ways  may be good news, i'd like to  see people make more wages, but  we know we've been feeding the  beast with regard to income and  higher prices. 3.9 equates to april of last  year to find a lower you have to go all the way back to march  which i think is pretty  interesting all in all. If we look at average hourly  workweek, 34.3. 34.3 basically has been where it has been most of last year. If we look at the  underemployment rate, 62.5  exactly as expected -- i'm  sorry, i'm sorry, that was the  labor force participation rate. 62.5. It has been hovering at that  level, joe, 62.5 -- 62.6 was  october of last year, last  year's complete high water mark  was 62.7. The lowest of last year was  62.5. Just to put a face on 62.5 and  now the underemployment rate  known as u-6, 7.5%, that is way  down from 7.8 which became  revised through 7.7. 7.5 would be the lowest going  back to june of last year. So pretty decent news there. The market speaks for itself. What did it concentrate on? all the numbers i brought out,  drop it wages, the  underemployment rate, the actual employment rate u-3 and it looks at the job creation of 256,000. We zoomed up all the way up to  4.77 plus on the 10, we zoomed  up all the way near -- near 5%  in a 30 year bond literally  4.998. That is something to pay very  close attention to because we  haven't traded over 5% in the 30 year bond since the fall of 2023 and we see the pre opening  equity markets took a huge ding, so we need to monitor not only  are we not seeing what fed  officials really thought would  be a slower jobs market, as you  pointed out we see sticky  inflation and much of the fed  speak last week was, well, we  think one to two cuts is still  in the cards. If the year develops as we think it will, meaning conforming to  dot plots, this doesn't look  like it's dot plotti",

        "TODAY THE SUPREME COURT WILL  HOLD ORAL ARGUMENTS TO DECIDE  THE FATE OF TIKTOK. THIS COMES AHEAD OF THE JANUARY  19th DEADLINE FOR THE PLATFORM'S REMOVAL FROM APP STORES IN THE  UNITED STATES. JOINING US RIGHT NOW TO TALK  ABOUT THIS IS BRADLEY TUSK. HE IS THE CEO OF TUSK VENTURES. BRADLEY, WALK US THROUGH THIS. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS HERE? IS TIKTOK GOING TO DISAPPEAR OR  DO YOU THINK THAT THERE WILL BE  SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY  THE INCOMING PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO HAS SAID HE'S KIND OF IN FAVOR  OF THIS STICKING AROUND? >> I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH HE CAN DO. THE COURT HAS BEEN -- ESPECIALLY LATELY -- VERY DEFERENTIAL  TOWARDS CONGRESS. SO, BECKY, YOU AND I HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT SECTION 230 AND THE  ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO TRY TO SUE  THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS FOR  THE HARM CAUSED BY THEIR CONTENT AND THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY  SAID CONGRESS GAVE THESE  PLATFORMS IMMUNITY FROM THE KIND OF LIABILITY AND THEY UPHELD  THAT. IN THE CHEVRON DEFERENCE CASE  FROM THE SUMMER WHERE THEY  BASICALLY SAID THE DECISION OF  WHAT HAPPENS ON REGULATION IS UP TO CONGRESS NOT UP TO THE  AGENCIES, AGAIN, THEY DEFERRED  TO CONGRESS. SO BASED ON ALL THAT HAVE IT  SEEMS VERY LIKELY THAT THE WILL  HAVE CONGRESS WHICH WAS TO SAY  THAT TIKTOK CANNOT BE HELD BY  CHINESE OWNERSHIP WILL BE  UPHELD. TRUMP CAN DO A 90-DAY PAUSE,  THAT MIGHT DELAY IT FOR A TINY  BIT BUT ULTIMATELY HE WOULD NEED TO PASS A NEW LAW BY CONGRESS  AND THE FIRST BILL PASSED WITH  BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THAT'S NOT  GOING TO HAPPEN.  >> WOW. LET'S JUST TALK THIS THROUGH. I MEAN, THAT'S A DECENT  ANALYSIS, I THINK, LOOKING AT  WHAT THE COURT HAS DONE TO DATE, BUT IF YOU ARE RIGHT ON THIS, IT DOESN'T MEAN TIKTOK IS GOING TO  DISAPPEAR OVERNIGHT.  >> NO.  >> ANYBODY WHO HAS DOWNLOADED IT STILL HAS THE APP, IT JUST MEANS IT'S GOING TO SHARPLY CURTAIL  THEIR GROWTH OR FORCE A SALE.  >> OR FORCE A SALE. RIGHT. I MEAN, THERE'S ONE OF TWO --  THERE'S ONE OF THREE OUTCOMES  HERE. THE FIRST ONE WOULD BE THAT  TIKTOK JUST KIND OF FADES AWAY,  GOOGLE PLAY AND THE APPLE APP  STORE WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO  HOST IT. YOU COULDN'T UPDATE THE APP AND  EVENTUALLY THE QUALITY WOULD  DEGRADE TO A POINT WHERE PEOPLE  COULDN'T USE IT AND FOR AN APP  THAT'S VIDEO CENTRIC QUALITY IS  IMPORTANT. THE OTHER OPTION WOULD BE  BYTEDANCE SELLS IT TO A U.S.  BUYER, FRANK McCOURT HAS PUT  TOGETHER A GROUP TO TRY TO DO IT AND OTHER NAMES RUMORED ARE  ORACLE, AMAZON, MICROSOFT, A FEW OTHERS. SO THAT'S POSSIBLE. AND THE THIRD WOULD BE THAT  BYTEDANCE AND REALLY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT DECIDES NOT TO SELL  TIKTOK AND IT JUST EVENTUALLY  DOES DEGRADE TO A POINT WHERE  IT'S NOT ON U.S. PLATFORMS  ANYMORE IN WHICH CASE, BY THE  WAY, THOSE 170 MILLION USERS AND ALL OF THE CREATORS WILL MIGRATE TO OTHER PLATFORMS, BOTH  EXISTING PLATFORMS AND NEW  PLATFORMS THALD BE CREATED TO  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE  OPPORTUNITY. SO THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE WON'T  HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SPEECH, OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW AND CREATE  CONTENT, TO ME THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL.  >> META HAS BEEN CONSIDERED A  BIG WINNER. CAN YOU THINK OF OTHERS  POTENTIALLY IF THIS PLAYS OUT  THAT WAY? >> YOU KNOW, TRUTH SOCIAL, ELON  MUSK, THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE AT  MAR-A-LAGO WHO HAVE PRETTY BIG  STAKES IN SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THAT WOULD DO PRETTY WELL HERE. WE'RE ALSO SEEING META AND OTHER COMPANIES REALLY PAYING AS MUCH  HOMAGE AND ASANCE TO TRUMP AS  THEY CAN. MARK ZUCKERBERG DOES NOT WANT  TRUMP TO PAUSE TIKTOK, THOSE HE  COULD GET A MASSIVE UPSWING IN  USERS IF TIKTOK GOES AWAY. THAT MAY BE PART OF WHY THIS  LOBBYING CHANGE, PUTTING DANA  WHITE ON HIS BOARD, SWITCHING  THE WAY THEY DO FACT CHECKING,  GIVING MONEY TO TRUMP, ALL OF  THAT MAY BE IN PART BECAUSE TO  HIM THE UPSIDE OF GETTING THE  TIKTOK USERS IS MORE IMPORTANT  THAN ANYTHING ELSE.  >> BRADLEY, I STILL KIND OF PUSH THROUGH WHAT CHINA'S REACTION  WOULD BE. YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE SAID THE  CHINESE GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T  ALLOW A SALE. DO YOU THINK CHINA STICKS WITH  THAT? DO YOU THINK THERE IS A BROADER  NEGOTIATION THAT TAKES PLACE  WITH THIS AS PART OF THAT? I MEAN, THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE  SPECULATING THAT MAYBE THERE IS  A NEGOTIATION TO BE HAD WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT OVER THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHY THE CHINESE  GOVERNMENT CARES SO MUCH IF THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN KEEPING  THIS AS A STRATEGIC ASSET.  >> RIGHT. I MEAN, SO, LOOK, ON ONE HAND  THEY'RE ESTIMATING IT'S WORTH  ANYWHERE FROM 20 TO 100 BILLION  DOLLARS, THAT'S NOT NOTHING FOR  ANYBODY, EVEN A GOVERNMENT. ARGUABLY YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO  SACRIFICE THAT VALUE EN TIERM. IF YOU ARE THE CHINESE  GOVERNMENT IT'S ALSO NOT THAT  MUCH MONEY, EITHER. IF THEY THINK THERE'S A BROADER  STRATEGIC REASON TO HAVE TIKTOK  GO ALONG OR PROLONG IT FOR AS  LONG AS THEY CAN, WILL USE IT  FOR LEVERAGE IN A BROADER  STRATEGIC NEGOTIATION I SUSPECT  THEY WILL DO THAT. IT SEEMS EARLY BECAUSE TRUMP IS  NOT TAKING OFFICE STILL FOR  ANOTHER 11 DAYS OR WHATEVER IT  IS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A  BROAD-BASED STRATEGIC OVERALL  NEGOTIATION WITH CHINA AROUND  TAIWAN AND TRADE AND ALL OF  THESE OTHER THINGS THAT ALSO  INCLUDE A RESOLUTION ON TIKTOK,  BUT MAYBE TIKTOK GOES AWAY FOR A WHILE AND THEN THERE'S BIGGER  NEGOTIATION WITH CHINA OVER A  LOT OF ISSUES, ESPECIALLY  TARIFFS AND TIKTOK RETURNS IN  SOME FORM AS PART OF THAT.  >> LET ME ASK YOU VERY QUICKLY  ABOUT CONGESTION PRICING HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.  >> SURE.  >> JUST FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE IN  GOVERNMENT, FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE IN WORKING WITH UBER, IT'S ONLY  THE FIRST WEEK. I WILL SAY IN THE MORNINGS IT'S  BEEN A LOT EASIER TO GET OUT OF  HERE, THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE  AS MUCH TRAFFIC, AS MANY TRUCKS. IS IT WORKING? >> HARD TO KNOW BECAUSE WE ALSO  HAD SNOW THIS WEEK AND THERE'S  BEEN SO MUCH ATTENTION AROUND  CONGESTION PRICING. THERE IS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT  FACTORS. ULTIMATELY, LOOK, GOVERNOR  HOCHUL MADE A BIG BET SHE  BELIEVES CONGESTION PRICING WILL WORK AND TWO THINGS WILL HAVE TO BE APPARENT TO VOTERS WHEN SHE  COMES UP BEFORE THEM NEXT YEAR  FOR THEM TO FEEL THAT SHE WAS  RIGHT. ONE, LIKE YOU JUST SAID WE HAVE  TO FEEL LIKE THERE'S LESS  CONGESTION, EASIER TO GET AROUND MANHATTAN IN A CAR AND, TWO, THE SUBWAYS HAVE TO FEEL BETTER.

EVER SINCE THEN I HAVE MADE A  LOG OF EVERY TIME I HAVE GONE ON THE SUBWAY WHAT DO I SEE. I HAVE YET TO GO ON A SUBWAY CAR THAT DIDN'T AT LEAST HAVE A  HOMELESS PERSON SLEEPING AND  TAKING UP THE WHOLE BENCH.

WELCOME FORMER HOUSE MAJORITY  LEADER, ERIC CANTOR, NOW MOELIS  AND COMPANY VICE CHAIRMAN AND  MANAGING DIRECTOR. THANKS FOR JOINING US. SEEMS LIKE THINGS ARE A LITTLE  DIFFERENT THAN THE LAST CONGRESS IN TERMS OF THAT MIKE JOHNSON  ELECTION AS SPEAKER. AT LEAST AT THIS POINT. CAN TRUMP MAINTAIN CONTROL? >> WELL, I MEAN, I THINK RIGHT  NOW, WE'VE BEEN SEEING FOR A  WHILE, YOU KNOW, HE IS THE  PARTY, AND SO, HE'S GOT A  POWERFUL PUNCH COMING IN, AND  IT'S GOING TO REALLY DRIVE AN  AGENDA, AND I THINK THAT IT'S  MUCH DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE SAW  EIGHT YEARS AGO IN TERMS OF THE  EXPERIENCE OF THE TEAM HE'S GOT  NOW. HE HIMSELF UNDERSTANDS NOW WHERE TO GO, AND I DO THINK THEY'RE  GOING TO GET A LOT DONE, FIRST  HUNDRED DAYS.  >> THE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL, IS  IT -- WILL IT BE ONE? IS THAT POSSIBLE TO DO? >> IT DEPENDS WHAT YOUR  DEFINITION OF BEAUTIFUL IS. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- IF  YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT --  >> DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU'RE  SITTING.  >> IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A  DEBT CEILING ON TOP OF THE 4.5  OR $5 TRILLION TAX EXTENSIONS,  ALL THAT, I'M NOT SURE IT CAN -- THE TRAFFIC CAN BEAR ALL THAT. BUT I DO SUBSCRIBE TO, YOU KNOW, A POSITION WHERE IT IS, I THINK, MUCH MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD,  EASIER TO GET ONE BILL. NOW, WHEN YOU LOOK TO THESE  MEMBERS, AND THEY'RE NOT GOING  TO GET EVERYTHING THEY WANT IN  THE BILL, AND YOU'RE GOING TO  WANT TO PROMISE THEM ANOTHER  VEHICLE, THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION TO HAVE ANOTHER RECONCILIATION  BILL LATER, SO IT'S NOT THAT THE DIALOGUE AND DISCUSSION WON'T BE ABOUT TWO, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO  TRY TO GET EVERYTHING DONE THAT  YOU NEED ON THE TAX PIECE ON THE FIRST ONE.  >> WE -- I MEAN, MY EYES DON'T  GLAZE OVER WITH BUDGET TALKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT IF WE CAN  TALK ABOUT, LIKE, WHETHER WE USE MILITARY FORCE TO SEIZE CANADA,  IT JUST SEEMS LIKE MORE  NEWSWORTHY DISCUSSIONS. TAKE YOUR PICK. PANAMA. GREENLAND. I THINK CANADA IS MAKING AN  OFFER FOR ALASKA AND MINNESOTA. I SAID, WE'RE KEEPING ALASKA,  BUT I'M OPEN TO -- GIVE ME A  PRICE ON MINNESOTA.  >> YOU GIVE THE PEOPLE OF TWIN  CITIES A VOTE. LOOK, THE THING IS, WE'VE BEEN  HERE BEFORE. I MEAN, WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS  IS ABOUT. WE SORT OF UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'VE MISSED OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS, RIGHT? YOU JUST HAVEN'T HAD THIS SORT  OF ENTERTAINMENT PIECE THAT  COMES WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.  >> BUT -- WHERE THERE'S SMOKE,  THERE'S -- I'M NOT GOING TO USE  THAT ANALOGY, BUT WHERE THERE  MAY BE -- THERE MAY BE A GRAIN  OF NEGOTIATING OR SOMETHING.  >> THERE'S SERIOUS ISSUES UNDER  EACH OF THESE SORT OF, YOU KNOW, THESE THEORIES OF PURCHASING  GREENLAND. IT IS ABOUT STRATEGIC IMPORT. YOU JUST HAD A PIECE ON THE  CRITICAL MINERALS, BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT RUSSIA. IT'S ABOUT CHINA. IT'S ABOUT THEIR POSITIONING IN  THE ARCTIC. >> WOULD WE USE COERCION,  ECONOMIC OR MILITARY? >> THAT'S THE QUESTION.  >> WELL, I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT  YOU'VE GOT A NATO ALLY THAT  YOU'RE GOING TO SIT HERE AND  UNDERTAKE ANY KIND OF MILITARY  ACTION --  >> RIGHT, BUT THE QUESTION IS -- >> AGAIN, WE'RE IN A  DIFFERENT --  >> IS ECONOMIC COERCION OKAY? >> WHAT ABOUT ECONOMIC COERCION? I THINK THE QUESTION IS, IS  THERE A WAY TO DO -- LET'S SAY  YOU WANT THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN. IS THERE A WAY TO DO THIS IN A  WAY THAT'S FRIENDLY, THAT'S NOT  SEEN AS COERCIVE? BECAUSE DOES THAT -- IF IT IS  COERCIVE, ULTIMATELY, DOES IT  CHANGE THE ENTIRE DYNAMIC AROUND THE GLOBE AS TO HOW PEOPLE VIEW  THE UNITED STATES? I MEAN, IT'S ONE THING TO BE --  >> THEY ALREADY HATE US.  >> THERE'S A DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN --  >> THEY GOT IRAQ. THEY GOT ALL THAT.  >> THEY LOVE US.  >> NO, THEY GOT A MILLION  REASONS TO HATE. THE GREAT SATAN? >> IF YOU WERE -- HOLD ON. IF YOU'RE A BULLY, I THINK  EVERYONE AGREES, YES, PEOPLE  WILL --  >> PEOPLE THINK WE'RE BULLIES  ALREADY. THEY THINK WE'RE BULLIES  ALREADY. EUROPE DOES. >> THEY HATE THE BULLY. >> THEY ALREADY HATE US.  >> THEY MAY KISS THE RING OF THE BULLY, BUT THEY HATE THE BULLY.  >> THEY ALREADY HATE US.  >> I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE  CASE.  >> I THINK THE APPEAL AND WHAT'S GOING ON NOW GLOBALLY IS THE  APPEAL IS WE GOT TO GO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES. WE'VE BEEN CARRYING THE LOAD OF  THE WORLD ON OUR SHOULDERS. THAT IS POLITICALLY WHERE WE  ARE.  >> CORRECT. >> SO, IF YOU'RE SAYING, ARE WE  GOING TO USE THE MIGHT OF  AMERICA TO SORT OF HELP BETTER  THE LIVES OF PEOPLE HERE AT  HOME? YOU'RE DARN RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT TRUMP WAS ELECTED  ON. BUT EVERY OTHER LEADER IN THE  WORLD IS OF THE SAME ILK, AND  THEY'RE GOING TO GO AFTER THAT  TOO. SO, WHETHER YOU SAY IT IS  COERCION OR WHETHER YOU SAY IT'S LEVERAGE, THE THOUGHT ON THE  PART OF MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT  ARE DRIVING TRUMP'S POPULARITY  IS THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T  THINK WE'VE GOTTEN A FAIR SHAKE, AND THAT WE'RE PAYING TOO MUCH.  >> THAT'S BEEN OUR TRADE POLICY  ALL ALONG.  >> BUT THE DEFINITION --  >> WE HAVE TO BE AN EXAMPLE OF  THIS. IT'S A REAL WORLD, ANDREW.  >> THE DEFINITION OF A STRONG  MAN IS AN INTERESTING CONCEPT  AND IF YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT  EVERY COUNTRY IS NOW TURNING  INTO -- ALL LEADERS ARE  NOW \"STRONG MEN,\" THAT'S A MUCH  MORE COMPLICATED PLACE.  >> THAT IS NOT, I DON'T THINK,  IN THE END -- TRUMP'S GOT HIS  WAY OF NEGOTIATING AND JUST  FRAMING THE DEAL AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT  PURCHASING GREENLAND. WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT A  NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT AND/OR  MAYBE CANADA SHOULD BE A 51st  STATE. LIKE, PICK YOUR SIDE. BUT WE KNOW HOW TRUMP DOES THIS. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT  REALLY IS ABOUT THE RULES THAT  WE PUT IN PLACE WAY BACK AFTER  WORLD WAR II THAT WE DON'T THINK HAVE BEEN PROPERLY SORT OF  FOLLOWED AND EXECUTED FOR US.  >> HOW MUCH OF THIS, THOUGH, IS  A RIDICULOUS CONVERSATION? IN THE FOLLOWING WAY. WE TALKED ABOUT BUILDING A WALL. WE NEVER REALLY FULLY BUILT THE  WALL.  >> WHOSE FAULT IS THAT? >> OWE ELON MUSK TALKED ABOUT  $2 TRILLION. WE'RE NOW TALKING ABOUT  $1 TRILLION. I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE NOT THE  GERM OF SOMETHING, MEANING THERE WILL BE SOME OUTCOME THAT WILL  BE POTENTIALLY HELPFUL TO THE  COUNTRY, BUT THE IDEA -- THE  SORT OF -- THERE'S THE BIG IDEA, AND THEN THERE'S A MORE  REALISTIC IDEA.  >> WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. WE UNDERSTAND WHEN THE -- WITH  THE WALL ISSUE ABOUT MEXICO  PAYING, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID  DO? UNDER TRUMP, THEY WENT AND  FORTIFIED THEIR SOUTHERN BORDER  TO GO AND STEM THE TIDE OF THE  MIGRANTS SO THAT WE BENEFITTED. THIS IS JUST HIS M.O. WE GET THAT. EVERYBODY'S FALLIN",

        "Governors and ichelle bowman  and patrick harker all looking  to slow things down. Join me now is lisa from td  cowan. >> good morning. Happy new year. >> down week on wall street. What is your word of the day? how do you see the last week  shaping up? >> the word of the day is  choppy. I think we see that in the data  you have been laying out through the show. I think we need to bear in mind  choppy means you need to pay  attention, right? it is not inherently bad. It just means there's movement  and you have to navigate  carefully. Choppy is the apt word and it  represents the market in which  it is building in apprehension. There are a lot of signaling and earlier guests pointed to that  to. We see a lot of resilience in  the data, but we don't want it  to be too hot or re-accelerate  inflation and you don't want to  get into territory where you see rates being hiked which is not  our anticipation. I think all of those things are  what you are seeing right now.  >> so, you have to navigate this market. You think it is a little bit  choppy. How do you navigate bond yields  at 4.7% and long bond at almost  5%. The rise in rates on the  long end of the curve is the  biggest threat to the bull  market. If so, how do you navigate the  market? >> by the way, we don't think  the rate environment is  necessarily going to change  any time soon. I think that's a fair point for  sure. I think, again, it comes to  navigation and selectivity. I think if you look at the  equities markets and you look at stocks, i think you really try  to identify names that are  leading through innovation and  that are disruptive and  predicating their innovation in  particular on bigger trends that they're seeing whether they're a demographic or otherwise. They are really responding to an unmet need or bigger forces  driving forth category growth or even the emergence of new  categories. >> lisa, you are leading me in  this direction. What's your pick today and why? >> yeah, we pick fresh pet. I think it's a really  interesting name. One is not in large-cap  territory. That is interesting in itself to talk about because i do think  there's an opportunity this year for investors to take a fresh  look at names that perhaps  aren't being talked about every  day. As i say, fresh pet is a name  that is disrupting by providing  fresh dog food and is really  available through special  packaging and special  technology. It has a competitive moat around it in that way. It is responding to the fact  that consumers are spending an  increased amount on pets and  pets is something they are  putting more resources to and it tie into the trend where kids  are less focus for a huge  portion of the population. We are now pushing 50% of the  population in the u.s. Of people under 50 who are saying they  don't expect to have kids. They are investing in their  pets. I think it is an area area and i think these are the kinds of,  you know, solid operating  models, but with really exciting growth ahead that we would like  to look into.  >> that was a surprising stat. Half of people under 50 don't  expect to have kids. That's a big shift in the united states. >> 47%. >> nearly 50%. >> 47% and that's up from 37%  only in 2018. It's a very, very pronounced  trend.  >> i do have to ask one thing  about fresh pet. I saw the move on the chart. A lot of growth in the last  year. What with the valuation? it trades 107 times forward  earnings. That's a lofty valuation.  >> it's grown a lot. You expect that in that profile  of company disruptive innovate  or. We say it's 25 times ev to  ebitda on the 2027 ebitda. We think it will grow another  25% this year. I think structurally with the  innovative names which are  smaller and in an environment  that is more conducive to m&a,  you have to look at historical,  you know, premium in that space  and be thinking about what big  consolidators might be looking  at. For a lot of reasons with the  organic growth and structure  side, we think the valuation is  merited. >> i'm a pet owner. I love this stuff. I tried some, it's terrible. >> as a person you tried it? that's not what water e're  recommending.  >> awful. Expectations for the jobs report if it is hotter. We had upward revisions from  previous reports. What are you expecting today as  far as the market reaction? >> we'll actually a little on  top of consensus there. Listen, i think that the market  is hopefully not going to be a  very, very quick reacting today. As i said, choppy and people are looking to navigate it. You know, we are expecting a  pause on rates as well. I think as you say, that's  become the consensus. It's such a weird week in the  market because it has been a  short week with equities closed  yesterday. So, you know, i don't expect it  to be a great day ",

        "BUILDING A NAME ON WALL STREET  JUST TO HAVE IT BESMIRCHED BY  THIS. I WANTED TO COME ON AND SPEAK MY PEACE.  >> BEFORE YOU SPEAK YOUR PEACE I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE MOMENT ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, THE MOMENT  THAT YOU WERE CHARGED. DID YOU KNOW IT WAS COMING? WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE AND HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW? >> OKAY. SO THE MOMENT I WAS CHARGED  WHAT'S CRAZIER IS THE MOMENT THE SEARCH WARRANT WAS ISSUED WAS  THE DAY AFTER THE WHOLE GAMESTOP SAGA. YOU CAN IMAGINE IT WAS A  WONDERFUL WEEK IN MY LIFE. AND THE --  >> SARCASTICALLY BECAUSE IT WAS  NOT A WONDERFUL WEEK.  >> NO, OF COURSE. THE THREE AND A HALF FOUR YEARS  FROM THERE ON END I'M SAYING  WHAT AM I BEING INVESTIGATED  FOR? WHAT'S THIS ABOUT? SO WHEN THE ACTUAL INDICTMENT  CAME DOWN THERE WAS A SENSE OF,  OH, MY GOD, I'M BEING INDICTED  AND I READ IT AND A SENSE OF  RELIEF SAYING, TESLA? NVIDIA? FACEBOOK? WAIT. I SHORTED THESE STOCKS? AND THEN, OKAY, IF THE  GOVERNMENT GOES THROUGH TENS OF  THOUSANDS OF YOUR EMAILS AND  MESSAGES, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S  GOING TO BE FOUND. SO WHEN I READ IT THERE WAS A  SENSE OF RELIEF.  >> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHETHER YOU  SHOULD HAVE THAT RELIEF OR NOT  BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THE SEC  SAID, WE UNCOVERED WHAT THEY'RE  CALLING ALLEGED BAIT AND SWITCH  TACTICS WHICH NETTED LEFT AND  HIS FARM $20 MILLION AND WHAT  THEY'RE CALLING ILL GOTTEN  PROFITS AND WE INTEND TO HOLD  LEFT AND HIS FIRM ACCOUNTABLE  FOR THEIR ACTIONS. WHAT THEY'RE EFFECTIVELY  SUGGESTING IS YOU PUT OFTENTIMES ON TWITTER WHAT YOU PLANNED TO  DO OR WHAT YOU WERE DOING, AND  THEN AFTER YOU TWEETED ABOUT  THOSE THINGS THE ALLEGATION IS  THAT YOU EITHER SOLD OUT OF  THOSE POSITIONS OR DID THE  OPPOSITE TO SOME DEGREE OF WHAT  YOU WERE TELLING THE PUBLIC. >> I'VE NEVER DONE THE OPPOSITE. THE OPPOSITE IN MY OPINION WOULD BE IF I TOLD YOU TO BUY AND I  TURNED AROUND AND SHORTED THE  STOCK. IT WAS RISK MANAGEMENT. ANYONE WHO TRADES STOCKS FOR A  LIVING KNOW IF YOU AVE A  POSITION ON YOU MIGHT TRIM IT,  MIGHT PUT STOP LOSS ORDERS IN,  MIGHT PUT LIMIT ORDERS IF YOU  ARE MAKING MONEY. MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY USED THE  WORD \"IMMEDIATELY.\" I TRADED IMMEDIATELY. BUT IN SOME OF THESE CASES  IMMEDIATELY WAS ONE DAY AND IN  SOME OF THESE CASES IMMEDIATELY  IS SIX DAYS, FOUR DAYS. FOR STOCKS THAT TRADE 50 MILLION SHARES A DAY. IT SEEMS OPEN THIS WORD  \"IMMEDIATE.\" >> IT DOES APPEAR WITHIN A DAY,  IN SOME CASES WITHIN AN HOUR. NO? >> OF COURSE. GENERAL ELECTRIC YEARS AGO WHEN  THEY WERE ON CNBC AND CALLED GE  IS A COMPLETE FRAUD I TURNED  AROUND AND WROTE A QUICK  WRITE-UP WHY GE IS NOT A FRAUD,  UP 300% SINCE THEN. STANLEY MILLER DEFENDED IT. I PUT IT OUT AND LUCKILY WITHIN  THAT DAY THE MARKET ALSO ALREADY REALIZED IT WAS WRONG, THE  REPORT, AND I SOLD MY STOCK AND  IT WAS MAYBE AN HOUR LATER. IT WAS. >> HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THIS IS ABOUT NOT JUST SAYING I'M LONG  SOMETHING, BUT I'M LONG  SOMETHING AND I HAVE A  PARTICULAR PRICE TARGET ON A  STOCK? SO I'M THINKING ABOUT IN THE  NVIDIA EXAMPLE, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW, WHICH WAS THEN TRADING AT  $144, YOU SAY WE SEE $165 BEFORE WE SEE $120. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SAYS  THEN YOU SOLD THE POSITION AT A  PRICE OF $150. >> THINK OF HOW CRAZY THAT  THAT'S A CRIMINAL CHARGE. I SAID -- THE WORDS UNREALISTIC  PRICE TARGETS. BY THE WAY, SINCE THAT NVIDIA IS UP, I THINK, 3500%. THE STOCK IS $140. I SAID I THINK THE STOCK WILL  STRAYED AT $160 AND I SELL IT IN THE $150s. THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF THE TWEET  WAS I SAID NVIDIA -- THIS WAS  2019 -- THE LEADER IN AI. I'M STUS JUSTING IT BEFORE  ChatGPT. WHERE IS THE INVESTOR  PROTECTION.  >> ONE OF THE EXAMPLES IS TESLA. I WANT TO RAISE THAT ISSUE  BECAUSE THERE IS AN INTERESTING  IRONY WHICH IS THAT YOU SUED  TESLA OVER THE TIME WHEN ELON  MUSK TALKED ABOUT TAKING THE  COMPANY PRIVATE AT $420. MEANING HE HAD PUT OUT A TARGET  ON T IT ULTIMATELY WASN'T  SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED AND HOW  YOU THINK ABOUT THAT RELATIVE TO YOUR OWN SITUATION.  >> I DIDN'T SUE HIM. I WAS PART OF A CASE THAT I  ACTUALLY DROPPED OUT OF THAT  SUIT IN THE CLASS ACTION BECAUSE AT THE TIME I WAS SHORT TESLA. I WAS THE FIRST TESLA CRITIC  THAT CHANGED TUNE ON IT. I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT FROM IT. ACTUALLY I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH  TO DO IT AT THE MOST PIVOTAL  MOMENT OF TESLA'S HISTORY WHICH  WAS Q3 '18. TWO DAYS BEFORE THEY REPORTED I  PUT OUT A 21-PAGE REPORT  EXPLAINING WHY I WAS WRONG ON  TESLA, WHY TESLA IS A BUY.  >> RIGHT.  >> TESLA PRE RELEASED EARNINGS,  STOCK WENT HIGHER, I MADE MONEY, I SOLD MY TESLA STOCK AND -- AND THAT'S THE LARGEST -- THE TESLA  IS THE LARGEST FINANCIAL OF ALL  THE CHARGES, THAT'S THE LARGEST  ONE. ME TELLING PEOPLE TO BUY TESLA  IN 2018. >> SO I THINK THERE IS A LARGER  ALMOST PHILOSOPHICAL -- THERE IS A LEGAL QUESTION AND A SILL  PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION ABOUT  WHAT YOU THINK THE INVESTOR  CLASS SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT BE  ABLE TO SAY PUBLICLY AND ALOUD  AND WHAT SHE SHOULD BE  DISCLOSING ON WHETHER THEY EVEN  CHANGE THEIR MIND OR CHANGE  THEIR POSITION.  >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. SO AS LONG AS MY OPINION I'VE  NEVER BEEN ACCUSED BY THE SEC OR DOJ OF EVER LYING ABOUT A  COMPANY. I SPEAK THE TRUTH ABOUT  COMPANIES, MY OPINIONS ARE  TRUTHFUL. AS FOR TRADING, EVERYONE HAS TO  TRADE WITH THEIR OWN RISK  TOLERANCE. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW TO TRADE. I WISH I HAD WARREN BUFFETT'S  PATIENCE, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE  ELSE'S TRADING ACUMEN. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THIS IS TRUE  ANY GUEST ON CNBC HAS TO COME ON WITH THEIR LAWYER IN THE  BACKGROUND BECAUSE I'M SURE  PEOPLE WILL BE DISCUSSING NVIDIA 100 TIMES TODAY ON TV AND IF  THEY CHANGE THEIR OPINION IN THE NEXT TWO DAYS AND THEY SELL IT  ARE THEY COMMIT AGO CRIMINAL  ACT? >> THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO  ASK YOU. I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU HOW YOU  THINK ABOUT FOLKS LIKE RORY  KITTY, FOR EXAMPLE, AND YOU  THINK ABOUT HIS CIRCUMSTANCES  MEANING HE SEEMED TO MOVE STOCKS MATERIALLY AT SOME POINT I THINK HE'S GETTING IN AND OUT OF THEM  WHEN HE PUTS UP A MEME AND YOUR  CIRCUMSTANCE.  >> HOW ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF  PEOPLE A DAY WHO ARE ON TWITTER, ON REDDIT, HOW ABOUT THE  HUNDREDS OF GUESTS YOU HAVE ON  CNBC AND THEY HAVE TO UPDATE  THEIR TRADING POSITIONS WITH  THEIR STATEMENTS? >> THIS IS AN INTERESTING ISSUE  ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT,  RIGHT, ON ONE END WHICH IS YOUR  ABILITY TO GO OUT AND EXPRESS AN OPINION, AND THE QUESTION OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN EXPRESSING  AN OPINION AND THE IDEA OF  MANIPULATION, RIGHT? >> FAIR ENOUGH. >> HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? >> WELL, IF YOUR OPINION IS  BASED ON FACT, I WILL GIVE YOU  AN EXAM, ON THE ACTIVIST SHORT  CAMPAIGNS THAT THEY DISCUSS, ALL THE FOUR ACTIVIST SHORT  CAMPAIGNS ARE 09%, MOST ARE DOWN 99%, THREE OF FOUR TURNED OUT TO BE COMPLETE FRAUDS. OKAY. SO I PUT OUT THAT INFORMATION. IS THAT MY OPINION OR IS IT THE  FACT THAT MOVES THE MARKET? THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING. THEY DON'T ACCUSE ME EVER OF  LYING ABOUT ",

        "Roger ferguson. Thank you. >>> well, this isn't last long,  did it? >> andrew, breaking news.  >> right now disney, fox, warner brothers, discovery they are now announcing they're discontinuing their joint venture venu sports. In a statement they're saying  after careful consideration  we've agreed to discontinue venu sports joint venture and not  launch the joint venture. We determined to focus on  existing products and  distribution channels. All of this comes after the  decision earlier this week,  frankly, for disney to  effectively buy fubo, which  is -- they were in a lawsuit  over over this very issue raises lots of questions about what  happens next in all of this. There was an argument to be made that disney was buying fubo in  part so that this venue deal  could move forward but perhaps  maybe this puts disney in an  even stronger position to some  degree and that all of these  sports pro dults might  ultimately come through fubo. We don't know that right now but that may be where this is all  headed given they will be  merging that service with hulu  tv live which competes with  youtube tv. A big twist in an ongoing soap  opera and drama and we will have to try to get a better sense to  understand what it all means,  guys. >> yeah, was this a concern from the leagues because the leagues  didn't want this to happen? was this a concern from other  potential competitors who would  have taken up and said, okay, if the lawsuit worked from that  perspective was it regulatory  concerns? i mean, bizarre to see this  announcement.  >> things happen so fast. Things happen to fast. When it was happening it was  like, well, what about nbc, why  aren't we part of this? now i don't care whether nbc is  part, is not --  >> see, now i'm not sure i read  this way, guys. I think there is an outside  possibility that this is  actually disney which is now  going to be in a much stronger  position given not just the espn of it that we can fold into this service --  >> i never thought this was  going to happen.  >> but fubo can ultimately be -- be the venue, if you will, and  it actually puts disney in a  much better position. I don't know if that's actually  what's leading to this. >> or if it was just squabbling  between the partners not being  able to figure out -- it's  like --  >> they worked so hard on this.  >> rich greenfield --  >> they made people add and  alienated people left and right  and it was all for within six  months things can change that  much on the landscape that it  just -- never mind.  >> you know, that may tell you  something about the landscape  today.  >> that's what i mean, the  landscape is changing --  changing so quickly. I don't know. How many streaming things am i  going to have, sorkin? can you tell me? >> all of them.  >> i think you will have all of  them or none of them or some of  them.  >> a bundle? i didn't want that thing that  they were putting together i  don't think. I didn't even know they came up  with the name.  >> i just found out about the  name earlier.  >> when did they -- they came up with the name a week before they said never mind.  >> the other piece, though, i  will say to this, if fubo  becomes sort of the play with  hulu tv live, is that it  actually may give both disney  and the entire sort of cable  ecosystem a longer tail and more opportunity in part because it  keeps the -- potentially could  keep the bundle together longer. I mean, that's one of the  arguments in favor of youtube t  vcht and all the folks that are  trying to -- trying to put these things together. It's going to be very  interesting to watch and  understand what's really  happened behind the scenes here. How much this improves or  doesn't improve the lot of life, for example, for warner  brothers, discovery. Obviously they don't have the  nba anymore, that also  potentia",

        "FOR MORE INSIGHT INTO TRUMP'S  MOTIVATIONS, LET'S BRING IN MARC SHORT. FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO MIKE  PENCE. THANKS FOR BEING HERE.  >> GOOD TO SEE YOU.  >> EVERY REPORT I READ WHEN IT  COMES TO THE PANAMA CANAL AND  GREENLAND AND CANADA, IT IS  ACTUAL DEMANDS AND A POINT TO  GET LEVERAGE AND TROLLING. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE  PRESIDENT-ELECT'S UPCOMING  ADMINISTRATION BEFORE HE IS IN  OFFICE, HE IS MAKING DEMANDS AND MAYBE JUST TROLLING? >> FRANK, HE ENJOYING THE  TROLLING AND BRINGING ATTENTION  BACK TO HIM. I DON'T THINK IT IS AN ACCIDENT  THAT THE FOCUS ON PANAMA WAS THE SAME WEEK OF THE PASSING OF  JIMMY CARTER AND HIS STATE  FUNERAL BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, THAT WAS A BIG PART OF THE CARTER  ADMINISTRATION GIVING AWAY THE  PANAMA CANAL. I THINK THERE IS HEIGHTENED  CONCERN ABOUT CHINA AND I  REMEMBER IN 2019 THE PRESIDENT  SENT VICE PRESIDENT PENCE UP TO  ICELAND FOR AN ARCTIC SUMMIT TO  TALK TO SOME OF OUR ALLIES UP  THERE ABOUT THE CONCERNS WE HAD  ABOUT CHINA'S GROWING INVESTMENT AND I THINK THAT MEGAN'S  ANALYSIS WAS GREAT ABOUT THE  FACT THAT THERE HAS BEEN A  CONTINUED CONCERN THAT CHINA IS  NOT ONLY INVESTING IN RARE EARTH MINERALS, BUT THE SHIPPING  ROUTES THAT RUSSIA WAS ENGAGED  IN, TOO. THERE IS A NATIONAL SECURITY  COMPONENT WITH GREENLAND AND THE REST OF IT IS TROLLING. WHEN IT COMES TO CANADA, THE  BIGGEST IMPORT IS OIL AND GAS  WHICH IS AN INDUSTRY FAVORABLE  TO TRUMP AND THE NOTION OF  HAVING TARIFFS ON THE IMPORTS  WILL REVERBERATE NEGATIVELY WITH THE ASSOCIATION WITH PRESIDENT  TRUMP. WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW THAT GOES.  >> YOU WERE PART OF THE FIRST  ADMINISTRATION. I WANT TO GET A SENSE, WERE ANY  OF THESE A PRIORITY FOR THAT  ADMINISTRATION AND HOW MUCH  MEANING SHOULD WE PUT INTO THE  IDEA OF THE PRESIDENT-ELECT'S  FIRST AMBASSADOR PICKS WERE FOR  GREENLAND, CANADA AND PANAMA. >> GREENLAND WAS THE  CONVERSATION AND CONCERNS ABOUT  THE ARCTIC CIRCLE AND  INVESTMENTS BY CHINA AND RUSSIA. THAT WAS A CONVERSATION. TO WHAT EXTENT WAS ABOUT US  ACQUIRING OR TAKING OVER, BUT  MORE OF THE SECURITY LEVEL. THERE WAS NOT A CONVERSATION  ABOUT MA OR MAKING CANADA  THE 51st STATE. I THINK SOME OF THAT IS  TROLLING. THERE IS JUXTAPOSITION AS WELL. FRANK, IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF  THE DECISIONS THEY MADE IN THE  TRANSITION, JOINED WITH THE  BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO OPPOSE A MERGER FOR U.S. STEEL BENEFITS  CHINA BY HURTING JAPAN WHO IS  OUR CLOSEST ALLY AGAINST CHINA,  IT ALLOWS CHINA TO HAVE 50% OR  MORE OF MANUFACTURING OF STEEL  GLOBALLY. TODAY, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION  FOCUS ON THE PROSECUTION. DON'T FORGET, HE FILED A BRIEF  WITH THE SUPREME COURT THAT IS  BEING HEARD TODAY ABOUT TIKTOK. YOU KNOW, THE FIRST  ADMINISTRATION, THE FIRST TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION SAID TIKTOK WAS  SPYWARE. NOW HE WANTS TO ABANDON THE  LEGISLATION AND ALLOW CHINA TO  OWN TIKTOK. THE INITIAL DECISIONS HAVE BEEN  PRO CHINA.  >> IT SOUNDS LIKE A BIG SWITCH  WITH PHILOSOPHY AND TIKTOK. DURING THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION, IT IS NATIONALISM AND  PROTECTIONISM AND AMERICA FIRST. NOW THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HAS HIS  EYES ON THE ENTIRE WORLD. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CHANGE OF PHILOSOPHY? >> THE CAMPAIGN IN 2024, I THINK HE WAS VERY CLEAR OF WANTING TO  BRING AMERICA BACK AND  ADVOCATING A FAR MORE  ISOLATIONIST POLICY.

        "To compare, 3 million jobs  created in 2023. Let's get more sight with dana peterson. >> good morning. >> i want to get your  perspective. The estimate is 155,000 jobs and wage growth 4% year over year. What does that say to you about  the economy and what will the  fed say about that when they  make their decisions later this  month? >> i think it says the u.s.  economy is doing fine. I do believe we are at full  employment. Anything north of 100,000 is  probably really strong. Again, 100,000 was kind of  break-even payroll the level  that you needed back before the  pandemic to have full  employment. That number might be a little  bit lower especially given the  fact that companies are  retaining more of their workers  because of retirements. I think the labor market is  strong. >> all right. You say labor market is strong. There is something you are  looking at and i want your take  on it. You are looking at the  unemployment rate for 27 weeks  has ticked up from .47% and now  about 1% at least in november. .3%. Why is that important? >> the highest it has ever been  in the last 20 years was 4.5%. That was certainly during the  pandemic. Actually, no, it was during the  great recession. So, there is some relevance  here. The point is it's up. A lot of that reflects people  jumping back in the labor market or reentering at a time there  aren't that many jobs to go  around. Remember, companies gutted their work forces during the pandemic  and spent three years getting  people back to the office. Those people are back and the  thing is it is more difficult. Anyone who is coming in at this  late stage will find it more  difficult to find employment. I think anyone who has run out  of unemployment insurance which  lasts for 27 weeks and they  can't find a job, that's the  friction in unemployment we will see. When you look at the level of  payrolls, it's extremely high. I think most people who want a  job have a job. >> i want to go to the wage  growth 4% year over year. You say labor costs are a  problem right now. Don't we want a strong consumer  to continue in the economy and  strong income growth for people  to go out and consume and buy  cars and it will also help them  weather these higher nterest  rates overall? >> it's really about  perspective. Absolutely, we want people to  feel secure. That is fuelling consumption. We saw everyone afraid of  recession in 2023 and weakness  in '24. We didn't see that because  consumers are working and wages  are higher and they had savings  and a reason to spend,  especially on services. However, it does mean that  inflation is higher. We think that for companies,  those wage costs are just  passing it on to the customer  and certainly that's causing  inflation, especially up core  services. That feeds into what the fed  does with interest rates. When you look at what's driving  inflation on the services side,  it is housing and insurance  costs and also the wage  pressures. It's good an",

        "MORE THAN 20% OF EPS ACCRETION  IN 2026. MEANTIME, PRESIDENT-ELECT  TRUMP'S SPEAKING AT GOP -- AT  THE GOP GOVERNORS CONFERENCE  YESTERDAY WHERE HE REITERATED  THE IDEA OF TAKING OVER  GREENLAND FROM DENMARK. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS  ALL MORNING. PIPPA STEVENS IS HERE WITH MORE  ON WHAT GREENLAND HAS TO OFFER.  >> PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP  HAS SET HIS SIGHTS ON GREENLAND  BECAUSE OF ITS RICH MINERAL  RESOURCES, ACCESS TO GLOBAL  SHIPPING ROUTES AND STRATEGIC  LOCATION IN THE ARCTIC, WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AS TENSIONS WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA FLARE. GREENLAND HAS 25 OF THE 34  MINERALS DEEMED CRITICAL BY THE  EUROPEAN COMMISSION, INCLUDING  LITHIUM AND GRAPHITE, WHICH ARE  KEY FOR EV BATTERIES AND CELL  PHONES. IT ALSO HAS RARE EARTH RESERVES, WHICH ARE CRUCIAL FOR THE ENERGY TRANSITION, MILITARY EQUIPMENT,  AND COMPUTER CHIPS. CHINA CURRENTLY DOMINATES THAT  MARKET, AND WITH TARIFF THREATS  AND POSSIBLE RETALIATION,  GREENLAND COULD BE ANOTHER  SUPPLY SOURCE. THE COUNTRY ALSO HAS AMPLE OIL  AND GAS RESERVES. NOW, AS ARCTIC ICE MELTS,  SHIPPING ROUTES AROUND GREENLAND COULD ALSO BECOME MORE  ACCESSIBLE, SIGNIFICANTLY  CUTTING TRANSIT TIMES AND COSTS  AND AVOIDING BOTTLENECKS LIKE  THE PANAMA CANAL. TWO KEY ROUTES ARE ON EITHER  SIDE OF GREENLAND, THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE AND THE TRANSARCTIC  ROUTE. RUSSIA HAS REOPENED MILITARY  BASES IN THE ARCTIC, AND CHINA  WANTS TO BUILD A POLAR SILK ROAD PASSING THROUGH ARCTIC WATERS  AND SO U.S. ACCESS IS KEY. THE U.S. HAS HAD A PRESENCE IN  GREENLAND SINCE THE EARLY '40s  AND CURRENTLY OWNS THE SPACE IN  NORTHWEST GREENLAND, WHICH  INCLUDES MISSILE DEFENSE AND  SPACE MONITORING. BUT RACHEL RIZZO FROM THE  ATLANTIC COUNCIL TOLD ME THAT  OVERALL TRUMP'S FOCUS ON  GREENLAND IS ABOUT ECONOMIC  COMPETITION WITH CHINA AND  MAKING SURE THE U.S. HAS CONTROL OF KEY ELEMENTS TO MAKE ADVANCED TECH TO COUNTER CHINA'S RISE. >> PIPPA, I THINK THE BIG  QUESTION IS, WHAT DO YOU THINK  THE ACTUAL COST OF THIS THING  IS? WHAT'S THE VALUATION? >> NO ONE HAS REALLY PUT A FIRM  FIGURE ON IT, AND OF COURSE,  BOTH GREENLAND AND DENMARK HAVE  REITERATED MULTIPLE TIMES THAT  THE ISLAND IS NOT FOR SALE, BUT  THEY DO HAVE VAST MINERAL  RESOURCES, BUT THE QUESTION IS,  CAN YOU ACTUALLY ACCESS THEM? OF COURSE, RIGHT NOW, MORE THAN  80% OF THE ISLAND IS COVERED BY  ICE, AND SO GETTING DOWN THERE,  THEY ALSO DON'T HAVE A ROBUST  LABOR FORCE AND ALSO NO  GREENLAND-BASED COMPANY HAS THE  RESOURCES AND KNOW-HOW.  >> BUT DO WE KNOW -- IF THE COMP IS GOING TO BE -- YOU COULD TAKE THE COMP BEING ALASKA AT  $200 MILLION BACK IN THE DAY. YOU COULD DO -- THE LOUISIANA  PURCHASE DOESN'T REALLY WORK  ANYMORE.  >> MANHATTAN.  >> HOW WOULD YOU -- HOW WOULD  YOU EVEN DO THE MATH? IS ANYBODY DOING THE MATH ON  THIS? >> NOT THAT I HAVE SEEN SO FAR. I THINK YOU WOULD BE IN THE  TRILLIONS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF  THOSE RESERVES, BUT THIS IS  REALLY UNPRECEDENTED. YOU CAN THINK ABOUT SMALL  CARIBBEAN ISLANDS OR SOMETHING  LIKE THE MARSHALL ISLANDS AS  MAYBE THE LATEST EXAMPLES BUT  THE SCALE THERE IS VERY  DIFFERENT. I THINK AT THIS POINT, NO ACTUAL FIGURE HAS BEEN PUT ON IT. THERE WOULD STILL NEED TO BE A  LOT OF NEGOTIATIONS. GREENLAND IS ALSO PUSHING FOR  AUTONOMY FROM DENMARK AS IT IS,  SO STILL A LOT TO FIGURE OUT.  >> THAT VOTE IS SUPPOSED TO COME US. THERE'S 50,000 PEOPLE WHO LIVE  THERE.  >> THAT'S RIGHT. THEY ARE PUSHING FOR THAT, BUT  THEY'RE STILL RELYING ON DENMARK FOR ABOUT ONE FIFTH OF THEIR  GDP.  >> THERE'S NO WAY TO OVERPAY.  >> I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK --  >> IT'S -- WE PAY A TENTH OF  WHAT IT'S WORTH.  >> IF RYAN OR BARBARA CORCORAN  WERE BROKERING THIS DEAL, WHAT  THEY'D BE CHARGING FOR  GREENLAND.  >> DEPENDS ON WHICH SIDE THEY  WERE REPRESENTING. >> RIGHT? >> I MEAN, FIRST, YOU LOOK AT  THEIR RESERVES AND TRY TO MODEL  THAT OUT AND THEN THE STRATEGIC  POSITION AND ALL OF THAT. BUT I THINK LOOKING AT A PRICE  TAG, POTENTIALLY, IN THE  TRILLIONS. >> I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD  NETFLIX SHOW, RIGHT? RYAN SIRHAN HAS THAT NEW SHOW ON NETFLIX.

        ">>> consumer spending ended 2024 with strong momentum. That's according to bank of  america institute's latest  consumer checkpoint. In december, spending per  household on credit and debit  cards increased by 2.2% year  over year. That's the strongest monthly  growth we've seen since february of last year. Joining us right now is liz  everett, the head of the bank of america institute and liz, when  we spoke with you earlier in  december, we were all wondering  if that spending was actually  going to show up. It did.  >> oh, it showed up. It showed big-time. I mean, it was strong going into the end of the year. It was like people were  accelerating to get to the end  of the year, to the raise, and  what was interesting is there  was two things driving that. One is an old story, services  spending. Services spending in december  was up 0.5%, people are  continuing to pay to have  experiences but the second thing is new, and it's something we  haven't talked about in a long  time.  >> clothing? >> clothing is part of it, but  the rebound in retail spending. Retail spending not only turned  positive, it's been negative for a while, but was at 1.3%, which  is the highest level in almost  two years. And it was broad-based in terms  of what was driving that.  >> i couldn't believe it when i  saw the clothing numbers.  >> 8.5%, but it wasn't just --  clothing was really the  standout, but it was general  merchandise. It was groceries. So, what we are seeing is -- and what we saw in december, it will be interesting to see if it  lasts, is this shift and this  transition, this rebound back  into retail spending in addition to experiences, though. It's not that they're shifting  from services to retail.  >> what was really interesting  about that is they were not  mortgaging themselves to do  this. They actually had increases in  income, and that's why they were able to spend.  >> exactly. And i know i say this all the  time but the key to  understanding the spending is  understanding the labor market. Obviously, we're all going to be paying attention at 8:30. What we look at at the institute in terms of the data to  understand the labor market is  actually income. So, after tax income coming into consumer accounts and what we  saw there was also very strong. So, across all of the income  categories, income in december  was up about 3%. That's an acceleration from 2%  in november, and the big change  here, the notable change, is  that higher-income households,  actually, 2.9%, but around 3%,  that's the highest level we've  seen for that group in almost  three years. And that's then translating into spending.  >> so, we have a jobs number  today, and that will give us  more to chew over, but this is  data that the fed has to look at and say, okay, maybe we're right to pause and not thinking about  further cuts.  >> we certainly share this data  with the fed, and we're looking  at it, and that, you know, that  is what our -- the data is  telling us. One of the things that i think  is also interesting that we take a look at often is, how does the data compare to what surveys are saying? and confidence, you know? confidence, michigan,  consumer -- we have seen  confidence increase, really,  since july, and that is,  obviously, translating into the  spending, but the driver of the  improvement in confidence has  really been the question, is now a good time to buy a large  household good? that's been the driver of  that -- of the michigan survey. But when we look at our data,  we're actually not seeing that  translate into people buying  more large household goods.  >> they bought so many of them  during covid.  >> that may be part of it. It may be part, people might  think it's a good time to buy  because the fed cutting rates,  financing might be better. They might be thinking, i want  to buy ahead of a potential  tariff. But the reality is, in our data, the percent -- the share of  people buying household goods is at the same level it was last  year and it's actually down from 2022. So, i think about that as a  reminder of why it is so  important for us to be looking  at the data from 69 million bank of america consumers as opposed  to listening to what they're  actually doing -- as opposed to  listening to what people are  saying they're going to do.  >> the one thing that jumped  out, gas prices, that was  responsible for a 3% increase  too. And if you look at the inflation picture, along with higher  wages, that has to be the thing  the fed worries about.  >> i think on gas prices, i  don't know if you filled up your tank recently, but gas prices  are ticking back up again. But in december, the average in  december was actually below  november, so that 3% growth  wasn't driven by prices.  >> it was people actually  traveling.  >> it was people traveling.  >> that's an excellent point  too. Fair notice that, look,  everything you're seeing goes  along with this idea that the  fed should not be cutting rates  again.  >> that's the story that it's  telling. I mean, the consumer is still  strong. And it is accelerating. So, you're seeing wages  increase. You'",

LET'S GET TO PHIL LEBEAU, WHO  JOINS US WITH A SPECIAL GUEST. GOOD MORNING AGAIN, PHIL.  >> GOOD MORNING, JOE. ED BASTIAN, CEO OF DELTA, THANK  YOU FOR JOINING US WHEN YOU GUYS BEAT THE STREET ON THE TOP AND  BOTTOM LINE, AND YOU REALLY SAW  AN ACCELERATION IN DEMAND AFTER  THE ELECTION. TELL ME, IN YOUR OWN WORDS, WHAT YOU SAW.  >> WE HAD A STRONG CLOSE TO THE  YEAR, RECORD FOURTH QUARTER  PROFITS, TEAM DID AN AMAZING JOB WITH RESPECT TO THE OPERATIONAL  PERFORMANCE, PARTICULARLY DURING THE BUSY HOLIDAY PERIOD, LED THE INDUSTRY ACROSS THE BOARD ON  THAT. THE BRAND IS HEALTHY. WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF MOMENTUM. ADVANCE BOOKINGS LOOK GREAT INTO THE NEW YEAR AND ONCE WE GOT  THROUGH THE ELECTION SEASON AND  THERE WAS CLARITY, DEMAND CAME  ACROSS THE BOARD, WHETHER IT WAS INTERNATIONALLY, CORPORATELY,  CONSUMER, PREMIUM LED THE WAY AS USUAL.  >> AND YOU KNOW THE DISCUSSION  THAT'S OUT THERE RIGHT NOW,  REGARDING YOUR STOCK AND OTHER  AIRLINE STOCKS. YOU'RE ALL CLOSE TO ALL-TIME  HIGHS, AND THE DISCUSSION IS, DO THEY DESERVE TO BE RERATED AT A  HIGHER MULTIPLE? THE SKEPTICS WILL SAY, LOOK,  THIS IS THE HEAD FAKE WE'VE SEEN FROM THIS INDUSTRY TIME AND  AGAIN. WHEN DO YOU GET TO THE POINT  WHERE YOU CAN SAY TO WALL  STREET, IT'S DIFFERENT THIS  TIME? >> WELL, WE'RE LOOKING NEXT YEAR IN '25 AT OUR ALL-TIME BEST YEAR IN HISTORY SO TO ME, THIS IS A  SUSTAINED MOMENTUM THAT WE  BUILT. IF YOU GO BACK OVER THE LAST  DECADE, WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING  STRENGTH. OBVIOUSLY, COVID HIT US REALLY,  REALLY HARD BUT WE'RE BACK AND  WE'RE BETTER THAN EVER. >> AND IT'S SUSTAINABLE? >> WELL, THE THEMES THAT WE HAD  FOR LAST YEAR'S INVESTOR  CONFERENCE THAT WE DID IN  NOVEMBER WAS AROUND  DIFFERENTIATION AND DURABILITY. DELTA IS LEADING THE INDUSTRY IN EVERY METRIC YOU CAN IMAGINE,  PARTICULARLY IN CONSUMER HEALTH  AND DURABILITY. WE'RE GOING TO GENERATE, THIS  YEAR, OVER $4 BILLION IN FREE  CASH FLOW, WHICH WE'RE GOING TO  USE TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE  BALANCE SHEET. I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES  YOU HAVE HAD WITH THE RE-RATING  COMMENTS ARE THAT THERE'S NEVER  REALLY BEEN AN  ENTERPRISE-LEADING, FINANCIALLY  DURABLE FRANCHISE IN THIS  INDUSTRY. DELTA'S GOING TO BE THAT, AND I  SEE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS US  CLEARLY ACHIEVING THAT, WHICH  WILL LEAD TO THE RE-RATING OF  DELTA.  >> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE  DIFFERENTIATION, YOU JUST HAD  CES CELEBRATING YOUR -- OR  MARKING THE BEGINNING OF YOUR  100th ANNIVERSARY, AND YOU'RE  TALKING ABOUT NEW PARTNERSHIPS,  WHETHER IT'S WITH UBER, YOUTUBE, DRAFTKINGS. HOW LONG BEFORE THOSE START TO  GAIN TRACTION AND YOU CAN SAY,  LOOK, HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE IT'S MAKING NOT JUST TO THE BRAND  BUILDING BUT ALSO TO THE BOTTOM  LINE? >> IT'S ALREADY WORKING IN ALL  THOSE PARTNERSHIPS THAT I  MENTIONED THAT CES THAT WE HAD  THE OTHER NIGHT, THEY'RE ALREADY GOING TO START TAKING EFFECT  THIS YEAR, STARTING THIS SPRING, SO WHETHER IT'S YOUTUBE, WHETHER IT'S UBER, AND IT'S BUILDING ON  THE EXPERIENCES THAT WE HAVE  BEEN CREATING. WE LIVE IN THE EXPERIENCE WORLD, THE EXPERIENCE ECONOMY, AND THE  HEALTH OF OUR EXPERIENCE FOR OUR CONSUMERS HAS NEVER BEEN  STRONGER AND AS A RESULT, THE  DEMAND'S NEVER BEEN STRONGER SO  WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO  PERSONALIZE. WE TALKED ABOUT DELTA CONCIERGE, WHICH WE LAUNCHED THE OTHER  EVENING. IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT, HOW DO  YOU PERSONALIZE THAT EXPERIENCE  FOR CONSUMERS TO MAKE IT AS  SEAMLESS AS POSSIBLE, DRIVING  INNOVATION ALL THE WAY FROM HOME TO YOUR SEATS? AND THE ENTERTAINMENT, THE  LOYALTY DYNAMICS THAT GO  ALONGSIDE IT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE  THE NEXT CENTURY OF FLIGHT TO  LOOK TO, AND I COULD NOT BE MORE OPTIMISTIC IN TERMS OF WHAT I'M  SEEING.  >> THAT CENTURY WILL INCLUDE NEW AIRCRAFT. YOU'VE GOT, WHAT, ABOUT 40 --  DID YOU SAY A-350s? >> WE HAVE 40 AIRBUS PLANES  COMING IN '25, INCLUDING SOME  350s.  >> ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH  THEIR ABILITY TO MEET DELIVERY,  GIVEN THE SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEMS? DO YOU FEEL LIKE THEM -- WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH BOEING IS A SEPARATE ISSUE, BUT THE SUPPLY  CHAIN IS TO THE LEVEL OF  STRENGTH THAT IT CAN MEET THE  DEMAND THAT'S OUT THERE? >> AIRBUS HAS DONE A VERY GOOD  JOB OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS  HITTING THEIR TARGETS WITH  DELTA. WE'RE A PRIORITY CUSTOMER FOR  THEM, AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO  RECEIVE THAT EQUIPMENT, I'M  SURE, RELATIVELY ON TIME.  >> WE'VE GOT A NEW  ADMINISTRATION STARTING IN A  COUPLE OF WEEKS. HAVE YOU TALKED WITH  PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP? >> I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT  ANY PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS I  HAVE HAD WITH THE INCOMING  ADMINISTRATION, BUT WE, AS A  FIRM, ALWAYS PROVIDE SUPPORT  THROUGH THE TRANSITION PROCESS  WITH THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION,  AND THEY'VE APPRECIATED OUR  INSIGHTS AND WE'LL SEE WHERE  THINGS GO.  >> GIVE ME A QUICK SNAPSHOT ON  THE CONSUMER RIGHT NOW. INTERNATIONAL, CORPORATE,  PREMIUM? >> WELL, ALL CHANNELS ARE REALLY STRONG, AND THAT'S WHAT LED TO  THE GREAT FOURTH QUARTER THAT WE HAD. WE'RE LOOKING IN THE FIRST  QUARTER CLOSE TO DOUBLE DIGITS  IN TERMS OF TOP-LINE REVENUE  GROWTH. WE'RE LOOKING AT DOUBLING OUR  EPS IN THE FIRST QUARTER. WE'RE LOOKING AT NEXT YEAR BEING THE TOP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN OUR HISTORY. YOU'VE GOT CORPORATES UP DOUBLE  DIGITS. YOU'VE GOT THE INTERNATIONAL UP  CLOSE TO DOUBLE DIGITS. YOU'VE GOT AMERICAN EXPRESS  LOYALTY REMUNERATION AND  SPENDING AT DOUBLE-DIGIT LEVELS  SO EVERY ASPECT THAT WE'RE  PUTTING OUT -- AND AGAIN, MANY  OF THESE IN PREMIUM  CATEGORIES -- ARE REALLY, REALLY HEALTHY.  >> AND THE INDUSTRY, YOU  BELIEVE, AT LEAST HERE IN NORTH  AMERICA, HAS IT MADE IT PAST THE ISSUES WITH OVERCAPACITY THAT WE SAW LAST YEAR? >> THIS IS THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE BACKDROP THAT I EVER RECALL  SEEING IN MY 25 YEARS. ALL AIRLINES ARE BEING  CHALLENGED AND APPROPRIATELY SO  BY THEIR OWNERS TO RETURN A  SOLID RETURN BACK TO THEIR  SHAREHOLDERS. AND PARTICULARLY IN THE LOWER  COST SECTOR. AND AGAINST THAT BACKDROP, YOU  SEE WHO THE BIG PLAYERS ARE,  PARTICULARLY SOUTHWEST. THEY'VE MADE COMMITMENTS. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GROW UNTIL  THEY START TO HIT THEIR RETURN  ON INVESTMENT CAPITAL NUMBERS,  WHICH IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE  TWO TO THREE YEARS FROM NOW IN  TERMS OF WHERE THEY'RE  COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. THEY SAY ONE OF THOSE CARRIERS  IS IN BANKRUPTCY, REALLY HARD TO GROW AND BREAK DISCIPLINE WHEN  YOU'RE IN BANKRUPTCY. EVERYONE IS FALLING IN LINE WITH THAT BECAUSE WE ALL ARE  BENEFICIARIES OF A HEALTHIER  BACKDROP, AND WHEN YOU CAN  PROVIDE THE RIGHT BALANCE OF  SUPPLY AND DEMAND, THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ",

NOW, IT'S TRUMP SO YOU HAVE TO  RECOGNIZE A LOT OF THIS IS AN  OPENING BID THAT HE'S TRYING TO  GET SOME LEVERAGE HERE. HE'S NOT GOING TO SEND THE 101st AIRBORNE ON JANUARY 21st TO THE  PANAMA CANAL, BUT THIS IS AN  OPENING BID AND ALSO THINK ABOUT MEXICO PAYING FOR THE WALL THE  FIRST TIME AROUND. TRUMP CAN FIND SOME RATIONALE OR SOME SPIN TO PORTRAY WHATEVER  DOES EVENTUALLY HAPPEN AS A  VICTORY. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE. LET'S SAY WE GET SOME KIND OF A  NAVAL FACILITY, GET SOME  SUBMARINES UP TO GREENLAND,  WHICH IS A CRUCIAL PART OF THE  WORLD, THE ARCTIC IS A REAL  BATTLE ZONE NOW BETWEEN CHINA,  RUSSIA AND THE REST OF THE  WORLD. TRUMP WOULD DECLARE THAT A  VICTORY IN A HEARTBEAT SAYING WE NOW HAVE AN IMPORTANT MILITARY  FOOTPRINT, OUR GREAT SUBMARINERS ARE GOING TO BE PATROLLING THE  ARCTIC FROM OUR NEW DONALD J.  TRUMP NAVAL FACILITY IN  GREENLAND. HE WOULD CLAIM VICTORY ON THAT. I DON'T THINK NECESSARILY YOU  TAKE HIM LITERALLY, GUYS, BUT  YOU TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY.  >> WHO WAS MICHELLE OBAMA MAD  AT? >> BECAUSE SHE WASN'T AT THE  FUNERAL.  >> SHE WASN'T THERE AT ALL. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.  >> SHE HATES TRUMP, SHE DOESN'T  LIKE KAMALA. I DON'T KNOW.  >> SHE DOESN'T LIKE POLITICS,  PERIOD, I DON'T THINK.  >> BIDEN. MAYBE. WE WERE WONDERING ABOUT -- THE  WHOLE THING IS -- IT'S LIKE HIGH SCHOOL ALMOST.  >> IT REALLY -- IT REALLY IS. IT REALLY IS. >> IT'S CRAZY. GO AHEAD. >> YOU GO.  >> NO, I ALREADY FORGOT WHAT I  WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT WITH  THE --  >> I WAS GOING TO GO TO A  TOTALLY DIFFERENT TOPIC BEFORE  WE GO, JONATHAN, WHICH IS THESE  WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA.  >> YES.  >> AND THE FEDERAL BUDGET AND  USING FEDERAL MONEY TO RESCUE  FOLKS WHO, FRANKLY, DO NEED IT,  BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING  TO HAPPEN LONG TERM UNDER TRUMP? ALSO GIVEN HIS OWN VIEWS ABOUT  GAVIN NEWSOM AND FRANKLY THE WAY CALIFORNIA HAS OPERATED.  >> LET'S TALK ABOUT NEWSOM, TOO, AND WHETHER IS HE JUST DAMAGED  BEYOND REPAIR AT THIS POINT? HE'S LOOKED -- IF YOU LOOK AT  THE HISTORY OF WT'S BEEN GOING ON THE DELTA SMELT IS ONLY  COMING OUT OF HATCHERIES. WE DIDN'T SAVE ANYTHING IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, NOT BUILDING ANY  RESERVOIRS, TAKING DOWN DAMS,  SAL MOM  SALMON REPOP OPERATION, IT'S  INSANE THE DECISIONS THAT  CULMINATED WHAT WE'VE SEEN.  >> YOU KNOW THIS AND YOUR  VIEWERS DO, TOO, THERE IS A LONG POLITICAL HISTORY OF ELECTED  OFFICIALS BEING DAMAGED BY  NATURAL DISASTERS THAT THEY  DIDN'T HANDLE WELL AT THE STATE  LEVEL, STATE LEVEL AND EVEN AT  THE NATIONAL LEVEL. SO THAT WOULD NOT BE A NEW THING IN THIS COUNTRY AND I DO THINK  NEWSOM IS GOING TO HAVE TO TRY  TO TURN THE STORY AROUND HERE. I THINK EVEN MORE PRESSING IS  MAYOR KAREN BASS WHO I THINK  TAKES A BIG CHUNK OF THE BLAME  RIGHT NOW. IT DOESN'T HELP THAT SHE WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY WHEN THIS THING  GOT OUT OF CONTROL. ANDREW, TO YOUR POINT ON TRUMP  AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THIS IS A GREAT ILLUSTRATION THAT ALL THE PLANNING, ALL OF THE PREP IN THE WORLD FOR AN ADMINISTRATION  GOES OUT THE WINDOW BY EVENTS. THIS IS GOING TO PROBABLY BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST NATURAL DISASTER  PRICE TAGS IN AMERICAN HISTORY  AND, YEAH, THESE GUYS BEHIND ME  IN THE WHITE BUILDING ARE GOING  TO HAVE TO PASS A BILL IN THE  FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR TO HELP PAY FOR HELP FOR L.A. AND  THAT'S ONLY THE FIRST. SO WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE IS NEXT. BUT CLEARLY THEY'RE GOING TO  NEED SOME KIND OF FEDERAL AID  HERE IN THE MONT",

        "Box.\" americans tipping less at  restaurants than they have in at least six years according to a  new piece in the \"wall street  journal\" that says the average  tip at full-service restaurants  dropped by 19.3% in the third -- >> 2. Dropped 2. Not dropped 5. >>> down from a peek of 19.9% in early 2021. Among the factors cited in the  piece customers grumpy about the sharp rise in menu prices and  mandatory gratuities.  >> that's it.  >> restaurants have badded to  the bills to offset higher  costs, another factor people are being asked to tip on payment  systems such as digital tablets  for things that wouldn't  previously have warrant add tip. I think i have spoken about  being at newark airport at a  self-service checkout, literally where you have to put your  credit card in yourself, do the  whole thing and it offers you  the option, you know, 20, 25, 30 percent.  >> you don't see a person  anywhere. I will tell you also shopping  online they now say would you  like to offer a tip or a  gratuity online.  >> really? >> shopping online.  >> for what kind of product is  that? >> for goods, buying goods. I can't even remember what it  was but it was stuff -- i see it now probably on 5 to 10% of the  purchases.  >> you have to tip your ai  agent. You have to do that.  >> it's crazy. >> so all the waiting staff over in paris are all going to move  here. 19.2 -- that is not --  >> i mean, it's an upgrade from  before, it used to be 15%, now  it's 20.  >> a lot of times there is no  tip at all over in europe or if  there is --  >> in europe it's a different  story.  >> i know. 19.2 is nothing --  >> that's up from -- when i was  growing up 15% was the classic  number that people were trying  to hit.  >> everybody does 20 now. >> then it moved to 20 and even  the options -- i don't know  about cabs, but i feel like  there was a point where it would be 15, 20, 25 and maybe now it's 20, 25, 30. I mean there, has been even  inflation --  >> there's always and other  button.  >> you can always price button.  >> i know you were never on  board, but wait until taxes  aren't tipped, you will be able  to get away with 8%. I'm telling you. Because after tax return to  these people are going to double when trump gets rid of the  taxes. So you're golden. See what i'm saying? >> good for you. You think about those things. I had not -- i had not  considered that. >> why tip at 20% when you get  to keep the entire 20? it would have been -- what does  it come out to after tax, 12? so if there is no taxes just do  12.  >> americans, though, are  uniquely -- we like to tip.  >> we do.  >> but the problem that i would  say is we like to tip even  though we tip -- so the thing,  though, that i think is  fascinating about this, real  quick, we tip because we think  that the people who are doing  the service work are not being  paid enough. That's historically -- i think  it's --  >> you tip for a service.  >> for service. For good service. I said out of good service and  guilt usually.  >> it's good service and if you  have ever had a service job or  if your kids are working service jobs.  >> right. I wonder when joe's tipping  thing comes in do people say,  oh, no, actually they're getting paid a lot more than they used  to?",

I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS FOR HOUSING I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD EXPECT THAT LONG-TERM MORTGAGE RATES ARE GOING TO BE BETWEEN 6% AND 7% EVEN THOUGH SHORT-TERM  RATES WILL CONTINUE TO COME DOWN AND I EXPECT SALES TO PICK UP  DUE TO PENT-UP DEMAND THAT WE  HAD SITTING ON THE SIDELINES FOR THE PAST COUPLE YEARS AS BOTH  BUYERS AND SELLERS, EXCEPT WHERE RATES ARE ACCEPT THE NEW ORMAL AND WE HAVE TO MOVE.

          "Some potential merger news in  the energy sector. Reports say constellation energy is in advanced talks to acquire  calpine for $30 billion. Natural gas prices are popping again as cold weather grips the  eastern u.s. Investors weighing uncertainty and energy production after  president-elect trump promised to do away with the biden  administration's offshore oil  and gas development ban. Joining us now is bill perkins it is great to have you on happy new year man -- >> great to be back. >> nat gas has been ripping. >> we finally got some cold  weather. The producer showed some discipline cutting back supplies and we didn't get into a containment situation until  november, where there was warm weather. With the cold weather, that  really means a lot to producers, not just for winter pricing, but for the entire injection season. That makes a lot more space for  gas to go into the ground, so  we're less worried about prices  dropping precipitously that should improve their cash flows and their ability to grow  production into the year.  >> okay. How much of this now hinges on weather and that draw down on  supply that is in storage. How much of this is tied to  policies with a new  administration coming in and potentially more lng exports as  in europe we're seeing some  changes with ukraine, russia,  lng deal going away? >> in the short-term and intermediate term it is all  about the weather. Market has been chopping around  with each run of the weather models it has been pretty exciting in the front. A little bit longer term, policy starts to matter, infrastructure starts to matter the facilities are ramping up, whether they ramp up on time or  early. We're hearing reports of plaquemines facility two months  earlier than expected. That adds to the demand picture. And you mentioned about calpine  being bought by constellation, that's all on the a.i. Data  driven demand that is out there. Electricity demand is  skyrocketing much more bullish than anticipated 12 months ago,  six months ago it seems insatiable right now. And so people are looking to take advantage of that so longer term policy  infrastructure matters more. >> yeah, bill, talk to me about  policy president-elect trump has been promising to boost energy supply as a way to reduce inflation is that a threat to energy prices how do you factor it in? >> well, i mean, if you remove the barrier tax on federal lands, speed up permitting, a  lot of it is just delay with permitting reform on federal lands and longer term, producers will respond to that and have  much more supply that will be bearish signal for  longer term prices it takes quite a bit to ramp up  a program, a drilling program, so i wouldn't expect that to affect things in the coming  year, but perhaps '26, '27, '28  we can see a slightly more robust supply picture. >> and now what about m&a? a lot of industries getting  excited about the prospects of the limits coming off on that in energy besides this calpine  thing we're hearing about today. Should we expect more of that? >> yeah, especially the permian. There is some good producers there, great acreage, efficiency of drilling is going up. And access to the market, we're  seeing new pipelines come out of there that are removing  bottlenecks. There is a macro story of  electricity demand going on that is going to play out over  several years unless that bursts somehow. And so i would expect some of  the larger players to look for strategic acquisitions in the  electricity side, generation side and also on the fuel  production side. >> how important is nat gas  going to be as this bridge builds toward nuclear, other alternative and sustainable  energy sources that have been  talked about, but haven't been realized in a meaningful way yet? >> yeah, i think it is going to  be very important. It has been very important our missions in terms of co2 or  particulate or any type of pollution per megawatt generated on an absolute level have gone largely in part of because of  the efficiency of natural gas  generation and lower polluting of natural gas we pretty much destroyed the amount of coal burned in this  country and it has done  wonderful things for people's  life expectancy and health and clean air. And so we have this abundant resource called natural gas here in the united states of america, loosenin",

          "So this is a new ceo being named as of liberty media. Back over to you.  >> julia boorstin, thank you.  >>> treasury yields capturing  plenty of attention on wall  street lately. The ten-year yield touching its  highest level since april  earlier today. Our next guest says the rise in  yields could be a false flag let's bring in fundstrats head of research tom lee, also a cnbc contributor. Tom, good to see you let's start there with the yield impact what might be people be reading  wrong, do you think? >> well, i wouldn't say markets  are necessarily reading it wrong, but i would say as  uncomfortable as we are seeing yields at near one-year highs, i don't think that this is going to be the level we see a few months from now and i think  that's more important because  ultimately if yields begin to  fall, because inflation  pressures are easing or if the job market is a bit softer than  expected, it really puts the fed put back in focus. So, i guess what i would just  say is it is not comfortable to  be here where yields are, i  don't think it really breaks markets, but i don't think yields are necessarily moving  higher over the next few months. >> well, it is particularly  uncomfortable, arguably, for small caps early last year probably around  this time you made a bold call on how much small caps could rise you moderated from that since. But where do you see small caps  going now? why didn't the big pop that you  projected for '24 pan out? >> yes, small caps have been disappointing. I mean, unfortunately i think  there has been a rug pull on those names a few times. I think investors are going to be very wary but to us, i think  the road map for 2025 is still one where the opportunity for  stocks to have much better breadth widens because not only  do we have an income administration that is pro business and i think it is going to boost ceo confidence, it is pretty evident now even seeing it in both ism readings  recently, but that's going to be a better environment for mergers, so, to me, while small  caps have been big laggards, actually for the last ten years, this ten-year underperformance to the the s&p is the worst in almost 100 years so second only to 1998 and then from a valuation  perspective, small caps are  still much more attractive, the  median pe is around 11 times,  that's seven turns cheaper than  the s&p. So, it has been tough, jon, to be overweight small caps, but i  think they're going to work in 2025 >> okay. I want to get your thoughts on some of the riskier assets or  the riskier parts of the market  that are -- i'll use the word  maybe potentially more speculative. Case in point, the quantum computing stocks, they had a huge move higher jensen huang from nvidia comes out yesterday, makes comments  saying that, you know, some of the super computers are still  and the full i guess realization of super computers is still  decades away and you see all the stocks tumble there is one that you like in  your granny shots here i believe ion q. Want to get your thoughts on what we have seen and some of  these parts of the market and  how to think about investing, if you should be investing in some  of these more speculative or futuristic frontier tech-like  companies. >> i think investors do need to  put a long-term lens on a lot of these important megathemes i think quantum computing is in  the earliest days. I don't think anyone can judge really whether it is 15 years  away or 15 months. And i think people have made many mistakes over the past 20 years looking at things like social media and underestimating the adoption rates there or  internet or even a.i. Now. Just think about two years ago how many people were saying a.i. Was going to actually take far longer than expected that being said, i do think the  environment for stock hasn't been great for the last three  weeks. I think it has gotten people into a recency bias thinking we  are near the top or stocks are just awful now i think we're getting close to the point where you should be  betting really and leaning heavily against that even look at a.i. Sentiment, it  is almost back to negative but, morgan, regarding quantum specifically, it is ",

          "For investors. >> energy trader bill perkins  joins us with his take on the  big swings for natural gas and how frigid weather, trump energy policy and geopolitics are impacting the commodities  markets. First to today's market action with courtney garcia and daniel  skelly it is great to have you both here, especially as we did have  the s&p basically eek out a  gain, though barely. More situation for the dow and the nasdaq but, courtney, just in terms of  how important yields are to the  equity picture, is that really what is driving things right now or is this a situation where there is a lot of sitting on your hands and waiting earnings  and other key catalysts like jobs later this week >> it is probably a little of  both when looking at the markets, especially today, a lot of that  is due to what is happening with the treasury and and inflation   going to continue to be a  headline that we're looking for. It did come off some of the  highs. You're seeing the markets have kind of recovered as the treasury has come down but really what the bond markets are continuing to tell you is  that inflation is likely going to be an issue you're going to start to see this peak in, goods deflation is slowing and you're starting it see inklings of inflation  continuing to peek its head here and that's where the markets are trying to see where the things are going because if interest  rates keep flying and inflation  is a problem, that is going to continue to be a problem in  2025.  >> you talked about this idea of a goldilocks view. You've written about widening  tail risks so, where do you see those risks and how do you prepare for them? >> sure, morgan, we're looking at a bit of a paradox this year  within markets in terms of an  unstoppable force, which is the  idea of u.s. Exceptionalism that everyone wants to invest here  and we got some of the leading secular themes meeting an  unstoppable object of u.s. Valuations and potential earnings and interest rate and inflation challenges and so the net effect of that  paradox is just a choppier first half to this year. And so as you were talking about earlier, we need to see more clarity on earnings expectations being met or exceeded and more information around the nature of tariffs, universal or select and what is the sequencing of  tariffs vis-a-vis the policy regulations. >> you say investors can buy cheaper valuations than the  megacaps, than the mag 7 with  high earnings growth you say you see opportunities in europe talk to me about how to approach europe when as dan mentioned there is a lot of focus on the u.s. Economy, on u.s. Stocks as  being attractive what kind of value do you see in europe >> yeah, and don't get me wrong  here, we absolutely still want to own the u.s and the question is the  magnificent 7 going to continue  to lead with the same kind of  outperformance it has been that's where i'm not sure it is. We're going to continue to own those things but those things are done really well, it is a good time to take  some profits, bring it back to your target. That's where with the profits  what areas do you want to look at that's where you look at things  like industrials, materials, both had negative to flat  earnings growth in 2024. Look at 2025, the earnings growth expectations are expected to be upwards of 18% and obviously much cheaper than  those mag 7. That's where taking some of the  extra money, putting it there  can be an opportunity. And europe also is significantly cheaper than the u.s., trades 13 times versus 22 times here in  the u.s. But the energy specifically in europe is even more dramatic,  about 50% discount to u.s. Shell, for example, trades about 8 times forward earnings or  exxon is like 14 tim",

IT WILL JUST TAKE YOU LONGER TO  GET TO THE DESTINATION YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE.  >> I THINK THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT. THE BAR IS LOW BUT I ALSO THINK  THAT APPLE, EVEN IF THEY DON'T GET THE A.I. TAILWIND, THEY HAVE EASY COMPS.  THEY HAVE DONE ENOUGH WITH A.I.  AND OTHER UPGRADES TO THE  iPHONE 16 THAT THEY CAN BEAT THAT LOW BAR.  THE QUESTION IN MY MIND, WHEN  GETTING EXCITED ABOUT APPLE IS,  WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE FOR NEXT  YEAR?  CAN THEY EXCEED AND GET BACK INTO THAT STRONG DOUBLE-DIGIT  KIND OF GROWTH?  WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT IN A LONG  TIME.  THE PEOPLE HOPE THEY CAN ACCELERATE TOO.  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WILL BE  THAT CAN DRIVE THAT KIND OF  GROWTH UNTIL LATER THIS YEAR.  >> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS BACK UP IN RATES IN GENERAL? ARE YOU CONCERNED IT WILL  DERAIL WHAT WILL BE A PRETTY GOOD MARKET HEADING INTO THIS  YEAR?  >> WE USE A.I. AND INTELLIGENT ALPHA TO MAKE  PREDICTIONS ABOUT HE MARKET. ONE OF OUR PREDICTIONS OF OUR  TRIO THAT WE USE PREDICTED THAT  THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR WOULD  HAVE A 10% LABOR OF CORRECTION.  WHAT IS SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT  WAS THAT WE MAY HAVE A RECURRENCE OF INFLATION AND  THAT MAY RESULT IN SOMETHING THAT MAYBE LOOKS LIKE WHAT WE  ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW WITH  RATES BECOMING MORE STABLE,  MAYBE EVEN RISING A LITTLE BIT.

          "Am definitely having shell shock from these high egg  prices and copy prices too.  we will have to hatch a plan for breakfast. Okay, i am done. >> very clever.  as always, kristina  partsinevelos, thank you.  >> kevin simpson is back.  he is the cio and founder of capital wealth planning. We think we have figure this all out. Let's try this again.  nvidia, you did what the other day? >> yesterday, scott, we tried  to harvest to the volatility that we saw in the free market.  we wrote a call expiring this  friday.  for three days, the option brought in one dollar per  share. It is a $147 strike. It gives us a little bit of  upside.  if you annualize out the premium, this is a fun thing to  look at. It is 60% annualized premium.  when you have markets like this  that are volatile, that are  shocking, to your point, we  will not sit on our hands and  we will try to harvest the volatility.  we have seven dollars to the upside and two days left in the  option.  >> j.p.  morgan trade was what? >> a little bit more boring. This one expires in two weeks. Is is our dividend strategy. The stock bottomed out around  230 in mid december and it has come up around 242.  we have $12 of upside potential  over the next two weeks but it brought in $1.10 and when you  annualize that out, it comes up  to an 8% annualized premium and  that is what we look for in our  main strategy. The nvidia trade is super fun  to look at but if you look at  these blue-chip companies and  you can generate an extra 5% or  6% a year in option premium, it  can really help, especially in a year like 2025 where things  might just not automatically go  to the moon again. >> what did you do with robin  hood?  >> this is in our growth strategy also. This was a final trade on  friday with the halftime report.  this is a stock that started off with the pandemic as a meme  trading thing. Cryptocurrencies, things like  that.  they are really maturing and they are looking at the long term plan in wealth management.  they recently bought a firm  called trade pmr which services  the custodian shift. They are  doing a lot of education online.  they are going after retirement  accounts.  this is a firm that recognizes a generation of weal",

          "Performance. If they take the necessary steps to get it, thanks for  talking. Rapidly rising rates and the future of this rally.  let's bring in cnbc  steve lee smith and bryn.  i will go to you first.  big of a story is this now for the market?  >> i don't think it will be a  big story three months from  now. I think maybe we move a little bit higher.  we have seen these numbers before.  we saw them in 2024 where we almost touched 5%. I think we will get a settling out after the inauguration.  we have some more understanding  around the policies and what actually will happen or the  potential to happened but i  think the bond vigilantes are  sniffing out.  the economy is strong. We have lots of unknowns from  the new administration that  seems on the surface to be inflationary.  as we get rates to be higher,  it will be a great opportunity.  i don't think they will be there by the end of the year.  >> the problem, steve, is not  so much the level, it is not that we did not think we would be at this level when the fed  started cutting rates in september. I am wondering how much you  think the fed itself has been  caught a bit off guard by all  of this. >> i think they weren't  expecting this.  i would have expected, scott,  that the improvement that we saw from april through september, maybe we had  overdone it a little bit but right now, we have round tripped that.  if you look at the 10 year over  that period of time, it is interesting that the stocks  have remained buoyant from that  pressure and i think it does shift the risk around a bit  which is this notion that we thought we were out of the woods on that refinancing thing  because rates have come down but there is a lot of debt that  will be rolling over from the  pandemic.  i think i have to go back and  look at those charts again to  see if that is an issue that is  worth exploring in terms of  risk to the system out there.  people thought they would refi and that gets to the heart of  your question. People thought they would refi lower rates and now they will  refi at the same rate they were  at before. >> bryn, you make an interesting point that you think this soon will pass. Three months from now, this  will not be a problem. To steve's point,  a.b.  stocks have not completely fallen out of bed because it presumably what you think is the reason that this will all  be okay. A lot of optimism about what this will bring. >> on steve's point about  refinancing, i think around 20%  of our debt, that is the market.  the fed cannot control the market.  as it relates to refinancing,  that might be a slight positive  because the rates have come  down on the lower end. I do think that your assessment  about right now, the market is getting the benefit of the doubt that rates won't stay at this level but for certain sectors like for small caps, everyone was so bullish. If rates stay at this level, i don't think we will see the  traders moving into those small- cap names as more interest rate  sensitive names. I still say stay at the cap  structure if you are going to  do a broad-based pla",

          ">>> welcome back.  it's time for today's three- stock lunch, and here with our trades, mr. Michael farr.  chief market strategist at hightower adviser, and of  course, a cnbc contributor.  first, chevron.  we heard a little bit from the ceo earlier today. The entire interview is at cnbc.com/pro,  and michael, you  say to buy chevron?  >> i say buy chevron.  thanks for having me, and  congratulations on this great  show.  kelly, this is awesome.  yeah, chevron's great and it's a must-see interview on  cnbc.com.  you've got to watch it.  this is a 4.35% dividend, it is  a fabulous balance sheet.  oil is sort of stilts hello -- still below its normal range.  anywhere around this 2.5% to 3%  for 2025, i think these oil  companies are a safe dividend  play.  it will be pretty good.  >> we don't have a lot of time,  but let's mention at&t, which  had a nice year last year. Do you like it?  >> no. It's okay, kelly.  i mean, at&t is fine.  so, how do you buy it now? you love the dividend. It's been great. At&t is a stalwart.  i don't have a problem with it.  as a whole, i can kind of do it, but i can't see where they will  come up with big growth for  this year. >> it's only up 20% on the year  anyways. >> compared to palantir, the hottest stock. 340% gain. It's down a couple of percent  this year. What do we do with palantir, michael? >> okay. If you all promise not to tell anybody, i bought the stock in may. Just between us. I bought it in may, and my personal account, because my brilliant son robert said, dad,  i like the stock, you should buy some.  i did not buy enough, needless to say.  i tripled my money in six  months.  i have sold 80% of my position,  maybe more.  it's about tha",

          "Demand that and will pull the  stock up like it has the past  two years. >> we watch all of that. Bryn, thank you. That was bryn talkington.  we will go to the broader  market now.  the doubt  is positive, albeit barely.  kevin gordon of charles schwab joins me now.  nice to see you. >> what is your read on all of this as you have listened to our conversation?  >> i love weprin was just  talking about in terms of when you get stretch valuations and you get hot sentiment and then it flips on the switch.  it can send a name or an industry or stocks in other  directions and that brings me  to a theme we have had for a couple of quarters now,  especially heading into 2025 where when you look at sentiment environment and 24, a  lot of the etrics that we  track were stuck in extreme  optimism territory for a big chunk of the year. You only had a few eriods  where it was early april to  late april in the midsummer  drawdown where some of that got  washed out and then it came  back very quickly. The environment and the ground is a little bit shakier heading  into this year because you had gone through a really long stretch of it being in extreme optimism territory.  it is not a reason in and of itself for stocks to sell up automatically but when you have  that shaky foundation and you  have a little more vulnerability, it opens you up to more of a draw down when you  have a negative catalyst.  >> do you feel like you are on the precipice of a narrative switch, of a sentiment change? as we also discussed with bryn and  steve liesman to start the  show, there is optimism about  what will happen despite some  of the concerns about  sticky  inflation and escalating deficit. >> the problem is you have these cross prints.  from a policy standpoint you have less change in regulation,  maybe a rollback and regulation, something that is  more beneficial from a tax policy standpoint but there is also a tiding mismatch because you have a regularly aggressive  tariff policy and you have a relatively aggressive  immigration policy that is being proposed.  it is human nature to look at  all of these proposals and take  them at once and say, here is  the ultimate it will happen but  we know that is not the case.  that is the benefit for  investors and probably the benefit for the economy for  most of this year if not all of  this year where if you exclude tariffs, everything from an  immigration standpoint takes a longer time to implement especially for taxes.  that is not something that the president can do unilaterally. That is why we are focusing a  lot more on what could happen  from a tariffs standpoint and  from an immigration standpoint but probably tariffs gives you that first hit and then  immigration falls under. You have to look at the suit can sing and what the result is  and from a growth standpoint --  maybe it is a little bit more  of a contrarian view but i think that the risk is more on the growth side, not as much on  the inflation side unless you  get significant retaliation  from other countries and you go  into a full-blown trade war. The tariff increase itself is  more of a one time price increase.  i would look from a cap x  standpoint and see if that materially slows and takes a hit. >> investors are a little  spooked by the move in rates.  are you? >> not as much.  right now, it is consistent  with a relatively healthy  growth backdrop. It is not like we have seen  some fall in estimates for gdp growth heading into this year  or even at the end of last year.  if you have for some reason the  material weakening in the labor  markets, friday's jobs reports are really weak and then you have some heat from cpi and  therefore cpe, i would grow  more concerned.  one of the reasons that you  haven't seen as steep of a selloff even as the rate of  change in something like the 10  year has really picked  up and you are getting closer to 4.7  and breaking closer to 5%, one of the reasons is that because the growth backdrop is relatively sparse. >> you have to keep in mind  too, if you take a longer look at the 10 year, in the sense of  the last three to four years,  you have gone through these  spouts, most notably the july  to october 2023 period where the 10 year did get up to 3% for a hot second and then a  reversed.  when you get to that point, you  have significant pullback in the market.  over that time, we have been able to move higher, not without a lo",

          "According to the federal reserve, guys, and this is why they have telegraphed they will  be slowing the pace of easing  in the coming year.  >> steve, stick around.  for more reaction to the fed minutes, the interest rate, the  macro economic environment,  let's bring in seth carpenter, chief global economist at  morgan stanley.  your take on the headlines that  steve gave.  >> unsurprisingly, steve did a great job. Look, i think the facts are  clear. The u.s. Economy is still on pretty solid footing.  the labor market had cooled, but was by no means cold, and  inflation keeps coming down, but there is noise, and there  are lots of ratings in recent  months that gave some of the members of the committee pause.  what is the central bank to do after you have cut interest  rates a lot and you don't know what the neutral rate is?  they ask themselves, how much  further do we have to go, and  they are inclined to keep going. We just heard on the wire, a speech from chris waller.  they are inclined to keep  cutting rates, they just don't want to overdo it. They are doing this balancing  act, and the fact they are getting closer to where they need to be, it is showing  through in this dispersion of  use, and just how much faster  and further they have to go. >> well, answer your own question, because i think it's confusing to a lot of people and by a lot of people -- i'm  referring to myself. In september, the federal  reserve cut rates by a half a  percentage point, 50 basis points, and we have been talking about the pace of rate cuts from the end of last year and all of this year, and all  the bond market has done is  react in the exact opposite  way, and bond yields continue  to spike, so i think the technical term is, somebody  screwed up.  >> i want to be a little bit more sympathetic to the really difficult job that jay powell  and his colleagues have. They are reading the data  coming in in real time.  they are inferring from the  real-time data what they have  to do. We were a little bit surprised by the 50 basis point cut, the soft readings in the labor market.  we thought, at the time, or  exaggerating what was going on,  but the fed did not want to  take any chances at that point,  and as they were just starting to lower interest rates, they  knew they were further away  from neutral.  if you are going to make a bit of a mistake, that would be the  time to, perhaps, cut a little bit more, so i think they were doing risk management. One of the paragraphs in the minutes that just came out was all about the risk management  discussions. Now, they are reading the  incoming data and asking, how  far do we have to go?  our view is, probably two more rate cuts this year. The economy will slow, but not crash for a while. There is huge uncertainty, though, about what will happen with tariff policy, as steve alluded to, what is going to happen with immigration policy,  as well? all of that uncertainty means  they can't be confident in how far they have to go. >> i guess, steve, the point is, there were a lot of people hoping that rates would go down  so they can afford a mortgage  to buy a home, and they heard  rate cuts, and they probably automatically assumed that rates would go down, and they  did go down, by the way. Maybe, they did something in september, but if they didn't, you thought, i will wait and rates will keep going down, but  they have not gone down. Is there anything you have seen, or somebody you talked to, that can explain why the fed is cutting while bond  yields are soaring?  >> brian, that's a great question.  reading these minutes, the 23  minutes that we get to read them , i was struck by the idea that  this did not, generally, read  like the set of minutes from a meeting where you would cut  interest rates.  unless, you are good, darn sure  that you are above the neutral rate and restrictive.  there were parts of this thing that you could read, like two  thirds of it, that would read  like the kind of minutes for a meeting, where they either held  the policy rate the same, or even raised the policy rate. It was a very unusual situation  when you look at the discussion  about the possibility of inflation stalling, when you look at the uncertainty around fiscal policy that is coming from trade and immigration.  you are right in the sense that  the rate cut was a little  unexpected by some people, and then you have people in the  room there.  we got some of that when we  look at the dock bought, as  well, but there was more than  one person in the room but did not want to hike rates.  not everybody got the vote, and  there may be some people that  voted for the rate cut, that did not think it was the best  course of action, may have gone  a long with the majority on  that, but you are right in the sense that we thought rates  were going to go down. If you look at that chart of the 10 years since september,  they have gone straight back up,  but the key here that i think is important for the fed and maybe seth wants to comment  on thi",

          "OR ASK, IS, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, BESIDES A REALLY BAD DRAWING ON A TELESTRATOR?  >> I THOUGHT THAT WAS FLAWLESS,  FOR YOUR FIRST TIME. >> NOT BAD.  >> LET'S ASK OUR NEXT GUEST. WILL RISING YIELDS TO BE A BIGGER PROBLEM FOR THE MARKET  IN 2025? JEFF KILBURG IS FOUNDER AT KKM FINANCIAL AND CNBC CONTRIBUTOR.  ALL RIGHT, DAVID, TAKE IT. WHY ARE STOCKS SHRUGGING OFF THESE MOVING RATES?  >> I THINK WE HAVE TO FACTOR IN, WHY ARE YIELDS GOING HIGHER?  THE DRAWING ON THE BOARD DEMONSTRATED CERTAIN PERIODS OF  TIME WHERE YIELDS WERE GOING UP  OR DOWN BASED ON EXPECTATIONS  OR FED POLICY, OR BASED ON INFLATIONARY PRESSURES.  THAT WILL HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON STOCKS.  MOST RECENTLY, YIELDS HAVE BEEN  GOING UP BASED ON GROWTH EXPECTATIONS.  IF YIELDS ARE RISING BASED ON  GROWTH EXPECTATIONS, WE CAN GET  MORE COMFORTABLE AROUND  EARNINGS GROWTH. THAT IS POSITIVE FOR STOCKS. IF YIELDS ARE GOING UP BECAUSE OF DEFICIT CONCERNS, OR BECAUSE  OF INFLATIONARY CONCERNS, YOU  ARE GOING TO SEE STOCKS FALL.  REALLY, IT'S A FUNCTION OF WHAT  IS DRIVING YIELDS, HOWEVER, I  WOULD SAY THAT OVER TIME, LOWER  YIELDS FAVOR THE EQUITY  MARKETS, PARTICULARLY, LONGER  DURATION EQUITIES LIKE THESE MEGA CAP TECH NAMES. THAT IS SOMETHING WE WILL HAVE TO GET USED TO.  WE WILL HAVE TO GET PREPARED FOR HIRE, LONGER-TERM RATES, HIGHER RATES ACROSS THE CURVE  AS RATES CONTINUE TO NORMALIZE.  >> JEFF, I LIKE THE STORY OF YIELDS RISING FOR GOOD REASONS,  AND IT HAPPENED IN THE LATE  1990s, BY THE WAY, BUT THE ONLY  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN  IS WE HAVE HUGE DEFICITS AND A BIG DEBT PILE. WHEN YIELDS ARE HANGING OUT AT 5% OR 6%, INTEREST COSTS ARE GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PAYMENTS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP HAVING  DEFICITS, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP HAVING A GROWING DEBT PILE, SO WE CAN BE AS COMFORTABLE WITH  IT NOW AS WE WERE BACK THEN  >> I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT,  KELLY. DAVID LAID OUT THE NARRATIVE.  HE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.  YOU CAN SEE EQUITIES MOVE  HIGHER WITH HIGHER YIELDS, IS  THAT THE STRONG ECONOMY. THAT WAS THE NARRATIVE IN 2024.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE LECTION  RESULT, PEOPLE GOT REALLY  EXCITED. NOW, AT 4.73 ON THE 10 YEAR, FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU SAW IT IN THE MINUTES, THE MARKETS ARE  QUESTIONING, WAS THE FED RIGHT IN CUTTING?  YOU WENT BACK TO SEPTEMBER,  THEY CUT 100 BASIS POINTS, AND THE 10 YEAR NOTE IS UP OVER 100  BASIS POINTS.  AS THE FED IS SNIVELING TODAY, YOU ARE SEEING SKITTISHNESS, CONFUSION. LOOK AT THE S&P 500. WE HAVE SEEN THE S&P 500 GO  POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, OVER A DOZEN TIMES. THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP, LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION.  FOR THE FIRST TIME, AS WE GET  CLOSER TO THIS 5% LEVEL ON THE 10 YEAR, PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING  MASSIVE PROFIT-TAKING OR REBALANCING, BECAUSE 2023 AND  2024 WERE HISTORIC EQUITY GAINS  BACK TO BACK.  AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME, IT SEEMS LIKE THE 10 YEAR NOTE MAY  GO TO 5%, AND THAT WILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN ACUTE REACTION  TO THESE HIGH FLYERS OR TOP 10 HOLDINGS ON THE S&P 500, WHICH YOU CAN EASILY ARGUE OUR WAY OVER CONCENTRATED. >> DAVID, WHAT WOULD OU SAY TO THAT?  >> I AGREE.  I THINK SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO  FACTOR IN, WHAT DO HIGHER RATES  MEAN FOR THE EQUITY MARKET?  I THINK THE PROBLEM TODAY IS THAT SOMEBODY PEOPLE ARE YEARNING FOR THE ULTRA LOW RATE  ENVIRONMENT WE SAW IN THE LAST CYCLE.

          "Assess.  lack of regulatory oversight is  among them.  j.p. Morgan has $10 billion set aside , drop in the bucket for them  to compete in private deals. Let's bring in to see how ceo  of blue owl capital. It is great to have you here,  mark.  welcome. >> terrific to be here.  thank you for having me. I'm sorry about the context of the tragic fires and we have partners and lots of players with them. Thank you for having me here.  >> appreciate that, of course. A lot of the real estate developers that we talked to, a  lot of them say that they are  turning to private credit for  financing. >> one of the megatrends, if we  want to use that word is the migration of more traditional  asset markets into the private markets. You are hitting on one of the  core themes that we see this year going forward.  we have one of the best in the business and lending.  the kind of lending you are  talking about properties and residential packages is exactly  what it provides.  i think direct lending is that we will see a similar migration  from those public markets into private markets offering large cap durable solutions. >> as you know, it goes where  it needs to. At some point, if people can't get a loan, it will turn to  private credit and say, at least this is an option. They have to hold capital. What about the private credit  world? >> we all focus entirely on  credit management. The key for us is that we have long-duration capital and we use very little leverage.  thankfully, we have been able  to originate over $100 billion of loans and have a 10 basis point realize loss basis rate. We have losses that sound more like ig losses.  however you will, the bottom line is unlike a bank, our money is locked up.  unlike a bank, we don't use  much leverage. Most importantly, we don't have  any depositors.  there is nobody standing behind  us.  this is private capital taking on a well-managed risk in the  hands of a professional  investor like blue owl appeared  as one of the banks in the financial ecosystem. They are complementary, but  structures are very different. >> that's interesting and we did learn from long-term capital management that if you are systemically important and i'm not saying that blue owl is  lt cm, but interns in terms of size, -- that's all i'm saying.  the other dynamic i'm thinking about a lot is interest rates. The higher rates are, the  better investors will do, but  can the companies afforded?  a lot of it is floating dead?  >> it is.  higher for longer environment, which has been what we have  anticipated candidly for the last 18 months and it's clearly  the consensus as a directional matter is very good for our  investors. You phrased the right question.  it's very good.  there is a level of interest bills and burden.  they are too troubling for them  to carry.  we stress tested that. The thing about private credit as we run a lot of years through a lot of different environments through covid, the  bank meltdowns, silicon valley bank, high rates and we have well over five and we tested the statements as the owners of  these businesses.  the great news is that it  works. They are durable to any current  rate levels or realistic bands around them. Surely, there is a version of  hyperinflation and rates that  would not be manageable, but i don't think we have a realistic  expectation. >> the growth speaks for itself. I am waiting for the big talks.  you know what's coming.  maybe not in the next couple of  years, but at some point you know it's coming.  >> we understand that and we know that it's transparent.  any regulator and the key point  is that we have capital that is  from a private group with  another private user and committed in much term to its  use. We really provide a stabilizing  force and not trying to  overstate this in a societal setting, but it's better to  maturation and risk and put it with private lenders.  >> like any new thing, the",

            "Microsoft said that google developed the quantum chip and it shares up more than 560% in three months and it is dead  wrong. That brings us to today's tech check. >>> joined by ceo alan baratz. Welcome to both of you.  >> it was google, indeed.  before we get to alan, a little  more context.  it stood at around $200 million  last year and shot up to nearly  $3 million after the breakthrough spurred a surge in  the sector and it's now down 40% on the session.  thank you so much for joining  us and making the time.  tell us what exactly huang, the  leading authority on the future  of computing is getting wrong  here.  >> thank you for the opportunity to be here.  i appreciate it. I think that he is a very smart  individual and has built an  amazing company. He may be the authority with many aspects of computing and  all aspects of computing and certainly not quantum computing. In this case, he's dead wrong. We are commercial today. We have companies like mastercard or pattison group that are using our quantum computers today in production  to benefit business operations.  not 30 years from now or 20  years from now or not 15 years from now, but today. Moreover, we have been able to solve problems on our computer in the area materials  simulation in minutes that would take well over millions  of years to solve on the fastest, which by the way have been massively parallel  computers. They should think a little bit about that.  we are solving problems in minutes and it would take  millions of years to solve them  on massively parallel systems  that he provides.  i would be happy to meet anytime and anyplace to fill in  these gaps.  >> i got the opportunity to get  to know him a little better  over the last month or so. Your  approach is very different than  what huang is talking about.   it's limited to optimization problems and you don't play in the same field. Is that  correct? >> no. When we say we are limited to  optimization, that is not an accurate statement.  we are very good at solving  optimization problems. Frankly, optimization represents most of the important problems that businesses need to solve, so we are proud of the fact  that our computers excel in  that area. That's not the only area we play.  we play materials simulation and we play quantum photography  and cybersecurity. We play in a  broad set of areas.  you are right. We have taken a different  approach from everybody else in  the industry and that is what  has allowed us to become commercial today.  >> what you just described sounds like what generative ai promises to do. Optimization promising relations et cetera. If the wave is offering better,  then why aren't you valued like  a a.i. Company?   why is it contracting in the latest quarter?  >> first of all, with respect  to bookings and revenue, all i will say is that our business  is actually growing nicely.  i am very forward --.  >> was there an exception? revenue was down 27% in your latest quarterly report. What happened? >> as i said, i'm looking  forward to sharing our fiscal  2024 financial and operating results when we report earnings. Stay tuned.  now, that having been said,  a.i. And quantum  are not competitive to one another.  there are some areas where you might be able to use both  systems and i talked about materials simulation, but we are so far ahead of what massively parallel gpu could do  in an area that i don't even do  that as competitive. When it comes to optimization, there are attempts to use it to  solve optimization problems. It's not necessarily their sweet spot and that is an area where i think d-wave  and  quantum computers excel. That is why we are working with  companies today to support their business operations. >> just to be clear, you are saying that it does play in the  same space that jensen is  talking about? i know that there is different approaches to computing and the  gate model.  i don't want to get into that. You are saying that huang  has it all wrong?  >> what i'm saying is that huang  does not understand what  you just said. There are different approaches to quantum. The two primary  approaches.  while his comments may not be  totally off base for model computers, there are 100% off  base for quantum computers.  >> we watched it back. From dead wrong to not totally correct. You walked it back a little bit. >> hold on.  when it comes to quantum computing, it's dead wrong.  we are not 30 years out or 50  years out, but we are today. We are supporting businesses today with quantum computers solve their heart problems.  in that sense, he's dead wrong.  there are approaches to quantum  computing that it will take  longer to mature",

            "Stocks have turned lower.  bond yields are pulling back,  but they were the highest we have seen, kelly, since april. The rate spike causing stocks  to sink. >> as we are saying this, we are back at 471 on the 10 year,  as we get the minutes coming out right now. Steve, do tell.  >> the federal reserve, at its december meeting, was at or  near the point, after cutting  by a quarter, of slowing its policy easing. The rate cut that they did enact was seen as, \"finely balanced.\" it was a finely balanced call, and some wanted to not cut at  all. That is more than just one dissent. Not everybody has the vote.  the minute say that the fed cut  rates to maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market, while continuing progress on inflation, because they believe they were restricted.  the risk between inflation and unemployment were seen as  roughly balanced.  inflation had eased  substantially, the remains somewhat elevated. What you will hear next is a lot of the back-and-forth of the meeting between those most concerned about inflation and  those less concerned.  the pace of the inflation, had slowed, some said. Upside risk to inflation had increased. Several were concerned that  this inflation may have stalled  or risked stalling.  on the other side, some people said this inflation was still  apparent across the board, especially, in market prices,  as opposed to the nonmarket  prices on a range of goods and services.  now, moving on, the firms we are seeing as more reductive to  increase prices, consumers were  more price-sensitive.  changes in trade and immigration policy.  now, a big discussion about  coming fiscal policy, it is  mentioned several times in the minutes. Policy could delay inflation improvement. The uncertainty of elevated -- also elevated the uncertainty  about policy.  there was rising business, optimism, however, and expectations for tax policy  changes, along with the  regulation.  positive market sentiment and  momentum into growth could put upward pressure on inflation,  and the fed was concerned about  knowing the difference between what was a temporary increase  in inflation, but that is the  implicatio",

Appreciate you bringing that to  us.  garrett. >>> has also been impacted by  the fires. He is on the newsline now with more details.  i don't know if you caught some  of that interview, but what is your experience? >> hi, kelly.  i did catch a bit of it. The area is devastated.  it's actually hard to believe, as you can see the images. So many of the homes are wiped out and completely destroyed.  most of the commercial area is gone and the fire went down to the beach. You have homes along  the beach and we have an area  with neighborhoods that are  just gone. The churches and schools are gone. What's amazing to me is  that in this day and age and we  have had record wins and certainly a terrible situation,  but in this day and age, it's  like a third world country and the fires continue to rage on. Last night, the reports that i was getting from my team on the  ground that were with  firefighters, the reports we that the fire hydrants were not  working. There was no water.  can you imagine? >> have you gotten any updated information? is that a major issue or any idea why that would happen?  >> what i was told and what was  reported to me that they mismanaged the reservoir supplying the hydrants and didn't refill it.  when i realized that they had a  problem, they could get it refilled in enough time. You have blocks being on fire  and the firefighters literally had to stand there and watch things burn down. It's beyond  negligence in my opinion.  we've got to get the community rebuild and support the  businesses.  of these homeowners that have  been devastated my daughter  lost her home and my son lost  his home. You get through all  of that, because you have to support the community, but some  tough questions need to be answered about how this happened and the leadership and the void  of leadership. Not just in the last couple of days, but the last couple of years. The public hillsides and mountains have not been managed  with the amount of brush that  created fuel that was just unstoppable and to have the  basic need of water. I just have to throw this out. I don't think this is the time that it should be on a global  trip.  the very basic needs of  leadership is to be present. I think there is real questions  that need to be asked about how  we manage the city and the budget of the fire department  was cut by the city council a  few months ago.  >> we have family and this is  an active situation. They are dealing with power  outages now and a fire spreading now. United said that they will reschedule flights no charge and no problem, but this isn't just about something that  happened last night and is over. >> that's exactly right.

Rates have backed up to all- time highs for the cycle and were 1800 points higher than we  were in october 2023.  >> that's right. The market and technology has  shown that they can withstand  the rise in rates. By technology, i am in cash  flowing elite technology.  mega cap, large-cap and leading  companies and a variety of industries.  which is where that phrase does  have merit.  look, interest rates have gone nowhere but up and tech has  been relatively resilient. We heard earlier about productivity. To some extent,  companies are getting wiser in the how they operate, but they are seeking out new ways and are using technology.  even in a slowing growing  economy, we think technology spend and capital spend will remain and that is another reason why we are resilient  with our belief that technology  is the best sector to be in. >> people might find it  interesting that you are doing that with etf, invesco and this  is not necessarily a mag seven play, but there have been a lot  of deal chatter the last couple  of days. You had shutter stock with a possible deal with the uniform space. It feels like we are starting  to get the drum be and that's  an area that you are focused on, as well, isn't it? >> yes, it is. We are overrating and  overplaying how much the new administration coming in will  matter, but not in this area.  we think that the market is  right and we think it's going  to be sustained if not supported by the incoming  administration.  it will be good for economic efficiencies and stock market. We know from the prior run how important that is to the trump administration.  we think that stocks are uniquely poised for this evaluations and and and a  related financial firms and  that is why we like the larger financial diversified capital  markets, because we do believe that there will be a boom and  it will be centered in those mid-cap companies across the board. Are you have vanguard, as well.  you like hilton and just returned to office, trouble  spend and lower cost efficiency.  i want to end on the defense sector over the years. This being the space where boeing has a little bit -- may be turning a corner that will  help.  you are not concerned by any headwinds? whatever might be coming from  doge and  that is an area that we keep hearing. We need to  spend more gdp.  >> part of my philosophy is to think about what's being said  and from the trump administration and what they are going to do. Cutting defense is not something they will do in a big  way and they will not cut  weapon systems not in the world  that we live in, plus there is a lot of proof about how technology is taking over the  war in ukraine.  i think we will look at  companies like boeing as real  leaders for our national defense.

              "Turning to earnings starting next wednesday in earnest with financials i think that will be positive, and i think that will be the catalyst for us to move forward. >> moves you're making as a  result of what could be a game changer for the rally, most of what you're doing today, it  appears to me relates to outside the sort of derivative play, if  you will, of what higher rates are going to mean. You've loved the india trade for a while. Now you're bailing on it, it looks to me, in numerous ways, through the inda, one related to small caps and the other may be  larger cap stocks. >> yeah. Look, i made money on the trade, but i didn't make as much money  as i thought with the supply chain moving from china to india, which i still think will  occur. The element you've introduced  also is that there will be more  onshoring, which was a theme already and has been a theme for a number of years. I think that accelerates,  because again, we talk about trump being pro-business, but is it really pro-business if you  get a cowardly move by mark  zuckerberg on meta to say, okay, anything goes now. And then what are the  advertisers going to think they're not going to come out  like disney and say, hey, we're  not going to be on twitter anymore, because of this,  because you can't do that. That's not politically correct in a different way now but it is influencing how  businesses work. That's not -business that's going to a certain  narrative the administration wants. As part of that, i worry about tariffs coming from india. I don't worry about tariffs  making good business sense,  because you do need some extern",

              "The pressure of upside yields  is over by a long shot.  back to you. >> appreciate it very much.  >>> just returned back to some market applications, j from  wells fargo, i know we are looking at the economic side of  things, but this is not an economic outlook and inflation to dynamic and fiscal dynamic. I don't mean bad, but as rates as it could be right now, what turns the tide?  >> what would turn the tide is you get good news in terms of  the inflation front. If you get a decent cpi print, that puts some downward  pressure on yields and another thing would be on friday when  we get to the deployment report  and a weak employment report.  people start to wonder, is the economy starting to soften here? i think it would be the  combination of weaker economic growth in terms of the economy,  as well as on the inflation  side that could potentially  turn the tide. >> you see a scenario. Does the size of the deficit factor in at all to the outlook  for next year? >> sure. We're talking about it in terms  of a cyclical sort of thing and  near-term sort of thing. Let's face it, the economy goes  into a hole sometimes soon and we are not going back down to  where the treasure yields were two or three years ago down  below 2% or something like that, so you could get a rally in  here where rates come back down  a little bit, but in order to  go back to those lows, we saw  them a few years ago and something really bad has happened to the economy just because the fiscal deficit now and debt concerns are so much  bigger than what they were even  a few years ago. >> steve, the adp number wasn't  that great this morning. If anything, yields went to the  highs after the reporting even though it was a mess and the expectation is around 150,000. That job support will be another chance for us to test  the market.  >> that's right. People are calling it the no higher no fire economy.  we will take a look, by the  way, at the challenger job layoffs data tomorrow morning  that we will get, which will give us a clue as to what's  happening. He saw the jobless claims down near a recent low just a tick  above 200,000. That's a pretty big deal.  we are not losing jobs, but not  gaining at the same pace.  that's kind of normal. The key from the fed standpoint  and shared several times that  the job market is not a source of inflation.  in fact, the job market could  be a source of disinflation  through the service sector is  indeed you have wages rising at  a slower pace. That's a good thing. Jay is absolutely right.   you need something to take the offer or bring the economy of  the boil in the sense that we  are not -- one good part about this that is not discussed a lot and they want to see the discussion in the minutes, kelly is the productivity story  that we talked about.  last week, this notion that you  have this upward move in productivity.  said it today what we said last  week, which is that it raises  the neutral rate and it does allow the economy to run hotter, but it is also a reason  why the terminal rate and sense  of where the tenure is should  be higher for that reason and  in that the fiscal deficit.  if you got a little clarity  about spending from the trump  administration and how they  were going to deal with fiscal issues, we might come up when  it comes to interest rates.  >> i agree.  i will give you last word on that.  what you think is going on with  productivity?  >> there has been some acceleration going on. Is it because of capital spending or technological  breakthroughs like ai or something like that? i'm not convinced that is  necessarily what it is, but it could be what going on, a  reflection of the tightness of the labor market over the last number of years. Business is out there and  realize that it's not like we  have workers just laying around  everywhere, but we've got to",

              "bring in show music please hi I'm CNBC producer Katie Kramer today on squawk po many things are happening that are exciting very exciting for our country not even inaugurated and making big waves around the world he's not president yet so none of it is I know but but he's going to be in 12 days president-elect Trump on Annex in Canada in Greenland and the Panama Canal what do you take seriously axio say mark Caputo says pay attention to it all just in case by now we had what 12 13 years of this we should realize it's both you have to take them literally you have to take them figuratively you have to take them seriously and sometimes you have to take them UNS seriously plus the rest of today's stories that got us squawking like those big changes at meta we never wanted to be the Arbiters of truth that's always a hard position to be in Facebook's first general counsel Chris Kelly weighs in on the new approach to factchecking and moderation online more speech is the answer to difficult speech it's Wednesday January 8 2025 squawk pod begins right now stand Becky by in 3 2 1 C please good morning everybody and welcome to squawkbox right here on CNBC we're live from the NASDAQ Market site in Time Square I'm Becky quick along with Joe kernin and Andrew Ross sorin and let's see how things are shaping up we are watching a Quantum Computing stocks and let's tell you what's going on uh sinking and extended trading this follows some of those comments by Nvidia CEO Jensen Wong during a investor Q&A call he shared his outlook on the timeline for Quantum Computing advances take a listen kind of said 15 years uh for for uh very useful quantum computers uh that would that probably be on the the early side if you said you know 30 is probably on The Late side um but if you picked 20 I I think I think a whole buch of us would believe it and but what we're interested in is we want to help the industry get there as fast as possible he also issued a warning to companies who are building quote general purpose Computing he said the era of coding by hand is over he also said that every single data center is now going to be built differently with accelerated Computing and machine learning capable machines shares of Nvidia let's show you where that stands right now uh now at about $142 it comes after a 6.2% slide yesterday his uh product re ation was viewed as significant in long-term but lacking short-term upside According to some analysts including one at stifel meantime take a look at shairs of Palante here they fell as well about 8% 7 7.8% yesterday now down about 14% for the week on Monday night several funds from Cathy Wood's Arc Investment Management unloaded nearly 200,000 total shares of paler that comes as Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of paler with an underweight rating and $60 price Target uh on Monday the analyst said success is more than priced in with palter trading around 160 times earning and that stock at 6885 I mean it was I I think the one of the best performers last year in the S&P 500 if you look at what happened with that stock too so maybe not surprising to see a pullback after a much longer upward u March at least over the last and that was really a combination of just all of the geopolitical issues in the country plus then you in the world rather to say and then you add Trump on top in the election and I think there was a view that that paler would be a massive winner depending on how you think the dod budg and everything else gets recalibrated firefighters battling overnight against a wildfire that forced evacuations in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Southern California nearly 50,000 people have been ordered to evacuate and thousands more have been told to prepare to leave strong winds have fueled the spread carrying Embers that ignited spot fires throughout the region there isolated wind gusts as strong as 100 miles an hour were expected to hit the mountains and foothills overnight according to the National Weather Service those winds are expected to remain high throughout early afternoon today schools are shut across the LA metro area nursing homes have been evacuated you've probably seen the pictures at this point of what's been happening with people trying to evacuate trying to get out through one road uh being forced to abandon their cars and then bulldozers having to come push through those cars to get them out of the way so First Responders could get through some shots from inside people's homes people still in them nice houses yeah with flames whipping up around malib a lot of people at this point have been asked to uh to exit uh that entire area which I know pretty well a lot of you think of Malibu you think of you know the blue ocean but there are beautiful Canyons all on these beautiful Golf Course a lot of of uh great real estate kind of scary President elect Trump held a wide ranging uh news conference at Mara Lago yesterday among the highlights uh Trump slammed President Biden's restrictions on offshore drilling he promised to revoke the order on day one even if it requires going to courts Trump reemphasized uh his desire to bring Greenland under Us control he made the comments soon after his son Donald Trump Jr arrived with other representatives in Greenland yesterday Trump also slammed late uh former President Jimmy Carter for selling the us built Panama Canal to Panama he said the canal was currently under discussion when asked by a reporter if he could assure the world that he would not use milit military or economic coercion in his effort to bring Greenland in the Panama Canal under Us control Trump quickly said uh no Trump also said again he hoped uh to turn Canada into an American state arguing the US is paying far too much to its northern Ally said he consider using economic Force to bring the country under uh Us control said you were considering military force to acquire Panama and Greenland are you also considering military force to Annex and acquire no economic Force because Canada and the United States that would really be something I love the Canadian people they're great but we're spending hundreds of billions a year to protect it we're spending hundreds of billions a year to take care of Canada we we lose uh in trade deficits he later uh posted this image on true social with the comment O Canada outgoing uh Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on X that there isn't a snowballs chance in hell that Canada would become part of the US Elon Musk responded girl you're not the governor of Canada anymore so it doesn't matter the governor what you say right Governor Ken govern Trump's been calling him for a while governor of a state the thing but what do you think's going on here for real and I I just think it's a bit of the Trump Doctrine I I'm not going to spend a lot of time worrying about it and thinking about I like my hair I I want my hair to stay I'm not I'm not going to set it on fire every day uh like so many people what do you take seriously I guess is the I I take seriously that Greenland is a really strategic U piece of of land that if we could we've done it many times in the past it sounds ridiculous crazy now but Cobalt lithium graph fite uh ship shipping um uh areas an access to the Arctic which we're trying to right now claims control of it claim I know they do and so and Russia used to control Alaska and Russ sold us to it well that's what we're talking about I don't know we'll see what we'll see what happens as I said I'm not going to you know start ring you might take you might use military well he he didn't say he would he said he wouldn't rule it out wouldn't rule it out I don't know whether I believe as I said it to me it's you know it's this fire hose of information Chang news that you're trying to figure out and evaluate what is real and what is not what he takes seriously what's a negotiations you don't know what's negotiations you don't know what he's trying to set himself up as things are going to change in terms of our standing in the world you look at China and Russia you look at how uh you know they view Taiwan you look at what Putin's we're not not saying there's going to be an invasion of Ukraine or something like that but in a more in a world that uh maybe people have perceived America as being weak I think he's trying to at this point say things are you know there's I appreci Sher in town I appreciated the message he sent to Hamas yesterday at the same time which was probably the most significant thing saying if you don't have some deal that's put in place to release these hostages by the time I'm here all hell is going to break Lo but then the question is what what does all hell break loose to me to me the bigger issue is how do you prioriti yeah but how do you prioritize and how do you take Serious what was the red line and how do you how do you say this is what we really care about and and and by the way totally understand sending a message like that to Hamas why we would aggravate and irritate our Northern Partners who have been really good allies for a long time I would just put them in different camps that's what depend you know lean says trade deficits don't uh matter with other countries um Canada benefits greatly from and we benefit also natural pet I don't really think I don't take that as ser I think that's sort of just uh you know I think that's almost like tweaking it's almost like um I think so too but it's weird to have all of those things that you just spin after you hear every one of these presone I know but but he's going to be in 12 days then we'll we'll we'll look back I mean I I lived through the first four years I'm fine I think everybody else was everybody else was fine in the first four years I'm I'm not I got a different one for you what's up so during the press conference there's the whole conversation about Facebook is this going to be a good thing or another scary negative thing about Trump I don't know okay you go ahead all right I know you don't want we didn't do much of this during the Biden Administration but but go ahead what what are you worried about I'm not worried about something it's a business question about okay what a business leader or business will think in reaction to this so Mark Zuckerberg clearly um takes the side of the president changes this all the so many of the policies personnel as Dana White all this kind of stuff and suggests that he's doing this because he's he believes in this stuff and thinks it's genuine he's saying that he's right you saw him on yeah right he's saying it we're going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes simplifying our policies and restoring free expression on our platforms more specifically here's what we're going to do first we're going to get rid of fact Checkers and replace them with Community notes similar to X the fact Checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created especially in the US and by the way there's been a question about whether we meaning the public are supposed to think that he's you know kissing the ring or bending the knee or whatever then the president comes out and is asked is he doing this because of the threats that you have made to meta and he says this is the President says yeah probably meta Facebook I think they've come a long way I watched it the man was very impressive I watched it actually I watched it on Fox allowed to say that do you think he's directly responding to the threats that you have made to him in the past yeah probably and I wonder whether if you're sitting as a CEO in America and watching that you're saying he's not giving me credit for anything or is he going to give him credit for this that's the that is actually a very interesting question like they say you know I'm not worried about it it's Trump but in it no but this is actually the F for businesses free speech is one of the most important things that we have in the country and I want all companies to adhere to free speech and not censor things that they don't like like laptops and lab origins of of viruses and none of this stuff and immigr anything negative on immigration can't be on Facebook all these things were banned from Facebook so if Trump says I'm for free speech and I want all voices to be heard and then Zuckerberg says okay right I'm going to do what the president said by not what he said to to him he said that he was going to put him in jail the if you are violating key provisions of of what you know we believe in then these threats even though they may be complete hyperbole but I guess your question is what does it mean for CEOs and how will they behave well I think the question is I think there's a lot of people who've gone down to Mar Lago and have I mean let's call it they've kissed the ring right and they're hoping they're kissing the ring and and I think a lot of them believe themselves that they're kissing the ring for the right reason meaning that the they they actually changed their position or not or maybe we're give too much credit for that I don't know but then to have the president come out and say actually yeah he's doing it under direct except for that here's the difference the president wasn't reaching out and putting that on Truth social doing it unprompted a reporter asked him a question totally he answered honestly what by the way very honest answer yeah what a concept we haven't seen a lot of that uh but but it it it is interesting because I think there is this calculus that takes place in many corporate leaders heads trying to figure out how to how to na because this is what they do they navigate administrations here around the globe and this is them trying to different here's the presidency we're still under right now so this is the kind of this is what we hear from the guy who who's still in charge you want to talk about a snowballs Helen CH chance in hell he didn't have a snowballs chance he can he can barely put one foot in front of the other this was never going to well you I'm just saying I'm just say you got your guy you should be very happy I am happy but I want just wish we had the same micromanaging of everything that was done for the past four it was totally outrageous I just wish we would have had the same introspect from or U skepticism and looking at every that from the mainstream media that we're now having for this new Administration which isn't even in yet they got we talked religiously about how how this guy wouldn't take a meeting with CEOs in America and that was a problem we yeah after he finally couldn't put two words together in aate it didn't happen we've been complaining about that for four years on this show oh God he through he Biden got a free pass for four years we don't need to we don't well now you don't want to there was some great press coverage for the four years of trump nothing for the four years of Biden just like a free pass on the most outrageous stuff now we're going to be back to doing this every day that's why I say I like my hair I can't go through it again will be next still to come the reverberations of Facebook choice to do away with third-party fact Checkers we'll check in with the company's first Chief legal officer on this shift it's a return to a free speech tradition that we very much tried to respect even as we did more content moderation uh in the early days of Facebook this is squawk pod stand andby in 3 2 1 Q you're watching squawkbox on CNBC I'm Andrew R sorin along with Joe kernin and Becky quick got a whole bunch of big stories this morning perhaps couple of the biggies meta platforms announcing it's going to end its thirdparty factchecking on its services and move to user generated systems of check mark similar to the community notes program on X cbc's learned that some meta employees took to the company's in-house Communications tool to voice their displeasure although criticism didn't account for all of the posts one worker said it appeared meta was sending a message that facts no longer matter and conflating that with a victory for free speech joining us right now Chris Kelly Facebook's former Chief privacy officer and former general counsel he's the founder of Kelly Investments and let's just start with the basics what did you think when you first heard this announcement many ways it's a it's a return to a free speech tradition that we very much tried to respect even as we did more content moderation uh in the early days of Facebook um cleaning up the ability to communicate and being able to you know easily present one's views was a critical part of the network from the beginning and in some ways Mark Clearly feels that we've gotten away from that and uh this change is meant to effective where do you where do you stand on this issue and the reason I ask is you know I think there's a question as to where is has Mark's mind evolved or was this is always where Mark sort of head was and maybe with some of the people around him and I'm thinking of the Nick Kels and Cher Samberg and others that pushed him in another Direction what's the sort of genuine view of this well I I think you have to create a space that allows people to communicate effectively and that requires some ability to push back um in the American free speech tradition that is usually with more speech and not in in in taking you know too much down and we always we never wanted to be the Arbiters of of truth that's always a hard position to be in um you know but you have to make sure that that you know your community doesn't decline into a cesspool of of of accusations back and forth all the time and and and of the presentation of misinformation either um the AI tools that Facebook has deployed and meta has deployed over time on all of its networks still operate here and there will be um addressing of of child sexual abuse material of illegal content things like that a huge part part of the decisions in the past I would say were business decisions business decisions based on at least a view maybe wrongly but a view that advertisers uh wanted this kind of control over the platform or at least people were telling Mark Zuckerberg that the question now is whether advertisers will stick with the platform very interestingly I would argue to you that X now is obviously a much uh broader platform today in the to the extent that it's more free speech oriented but it hasn't necessarily worked uh as an advertising platform I I I do think that advertisers are continue going to continue to express their opinions and they're not going to want to have their brand advertising in particular appear um next to offensive material and and I think that that will continue to be a piece of pressure on the company um just as it is on X and on every other platform so I don't think that that this this will actually end up making a massive difference in your day-to-day experience on Facebook so you don't think it changes do you think that the experience on on X has changed I I I do think it has and and we'll see if that works for advertisers over time um I I think that there's some you know encouraging uh you know indications that that you know there's some adaptation that's going on I think the community notes feature is excellent and it's been implemented very well on what did you make I mean there was sort of an interesting moment yesterday during the the Trump press conference because you know on one side you saw Mark Zuckerberg take to Facebook and Instagram announcing all of this and I think uh making a a i I hope genuine argument I'm sure there are people who question how genuine it was but then of course later in the after and saying that he was doing it in part because he thinks that politically the the country has moved and then you know 3 hours later you have Trump being asked whether he's effectively doing this genuinely or whe whether he's doing this because of the threats that have come from Trump and he says yeah probably probably because he's doing it under duress I I did see that but I I do think and having been there in the initial discussions we always wanted to Hue to the American free speech tradition which is more speech is the answer to difficult speech um that that it was meant to Facebook is meant to be a place for discourse and the you know you know de emphasis of of political content and the ability to express yourself is something that that I I think that the there's some regrets around the way that that was implemented particularly um in the postco period how do you think this changes the regulatory story for meta meaning there there's there's a whole bunch there's a whole bunch of uh of of State well I don't know what you think is going to happen to the attorney generals but there's a whole bunch of of of regulatory issues that are around meta right now and the question is whether you think they disappear well I no I certainly don't think they disappear I think that there's going to continue to be a bunch of discussions and I think that the company has tried to to act very responsibly around addressing uh some of the worries about harm and self harm material that's presented online um some of the controls that they've tried to introduce particularly on Instagram and teen accounts and things like that um you know this has always been an incredibly complex problem um there isn't really a right answer at the end of the day unfortunately for the company or for uh everyone online you're dealing with expression which is a messy messy thing that uh uh you know sometimes people are you know expressing themselves in in ways that are are hurtful um to themselves or to others and you have to figure out a way to you know guide a discussion so that it's civilized and and that people get a lot of value you know that's one of the key one of the key things that they're trying to return to Chris Andrew and I were were having a question discuss yesterday I was thinking about it at home because Andrew was saying you you thought maybe section whatever it is 230 yeah that you should get rid of it and then I said I think I was saying that about Andrew about like protections for like teens that are getting like naked photo shared and they should be liable I don't think I ever meant it for for like the free flow of like news or information or or things like way topar well prevents from being for anything that's posted on on I know but but it seems like you'd have to do it in in in a way where certain stuff you are liable for but but but airing news that may or may not you know you you can't know when you're airing something laptop for example CH uh the V the lab origin of a virus you can't know well you would just be you would be subject it doesn't mean you can't you don't want people that you can have people come after you to say did you have malicious intent with but the bullying part in in in all the all the horrible stuff that happens on on social media the kids they have to take responsibility that but those are separate issues aren't they free spee versus actual U nefarious intent to harm people one of one of the most interesting things about the section 230 debate that that people have often you know neglected is that it actually allows you to take action against harmful material online um effectively and and one of the reasons that that I always thought it shouldn't be changed is is that is is precisely because of that you have effectively a safe harbor for some things that you're doing to address those problematic pieces of content for addressing clearly illegal content like child sexual abuse material and some of the revenge porn things that have gone on online and you can still go after that prosecute the company can still take action about it and it and it actually is sort of encouraged to do so by the protections of section 230 so that's been a kind of Mi a misnomer over time I feel like it would be stronger Chris you're yelling us we got to go but I feel like it would be much stronger if 230 didn't exist there would it would be much more pressure on companies to make sure that they were going after them not just encouraged to do it but you're in trouble if you don't uh I I I mean I think you're still in trouble if you don't there's certainly a lot of regulatory pressure um on addressing it even under a section 230 rine Chris uh come on back there's so much more to talk about with this we really appreciate it it's great to see you absolutely thanks so much for having next on squawk pod Greenland Panama Canada president-elect Trump has floated us expansion an axio senior politic reporter Mark Caputo says as wild as it seems we should take Donald Trump seriously at least sometimes unlike an administrations and campaigns past Donald Trump has a staff and structure around him that says well if Donald Trump says it then we'll try to make it happen welcome back to squawk pod from CNBC where were digesting yesterday's hourong news conference with president-elect Trump the Panama Canal is a disgrace what took place at the Panama Canal they laugh at us because they think we're stupid but we're not stupid anymore we need Greenland for national security purposes I've been told that for a long time long before I even ran I mean people have been talking about it for a long time I'm talking about protecting the Free World you look at you don't even need binoculars you look outside you have China ships all over the place you have Russian ships all over the place we're not letting that happen here's Andrew Ross sorin President elect Trump renewing his call to gain Us control of Greenland also the Panama Canal maybe even Canada yesterday he declined to rule out using military and economic coercion to achieve those goals join us right now with more on all this Mark Caputo is a senior politics reporter for axios good morning to you uh we were debating a little bit of this earlier in the broadcast Mark and I think we're all trying to figure out how much of this we're supposed to take seriously how much we're supposed to take a sort of trump Doctrine uh a negotiating posture of sorts how do you view it one of the things that was said in what 2016 is not to take Trump or that his voters didn't always take Trump literally they took him figuratively I think by now we had what 12 13 years of this we should realize it's both you have to take them literally you have to take them figuratively you have take him seriously and sometimes you have to take him UNS seriously so the short answer to question is I don't know I don't think any of us knows the likelihood that we're actually going to acquire Greenland in some way shape or form when we've got trillions in debt and a huge budget deficit is pretty slim considering the narrow margins in Congress because after all Congress will probably need to do something about taking over New Territory but nevertheless Trump wants to do this in some way shape or form and unlike an Administration and campaigns passed Donald Trump has a staff and structure around him that says well if Donald Trump says it then we'll try to make it happen well how much is it worth Mark I mean I wonder what the blue book is and you remember you remember I I if it's not that much money I I I disagree that that the budget uh deficit wouldn't allow it it certainly allows us to uh to expend a lot of money on on other things uh like that help for Ukraine help for other places we spent I don't remember what we spent on Alaska but it was it was called a Folly at the time I think it would do you remember what it was it was in the millions I don't even think it was in the billions when it happened and one of the great purchases obviously of all time and Greenland if it could be done if you could you know we talk about coercion make them an offer they can't refuse what does that mean exactly that's a good question well in the case of Seward buying Alaska zarus Russia wanted to sell it in the case of Greenland Denmark right now doesn't million million I'll take two right exactly but in the end it's not just whether we can afford it or not it's whether Congress thinks we can afford it or not there are very narrow margins in Congress it's just difficult to see that doesn't mean that Donald Trump isn't serious about it or you know grading on a Donald Trump curve whether he's seriously using about it but we should take it seriously and once he's began talking about this again remember he discussed this in 2018 and 2019 people have to take him seriously about it his campaign does or better said ad but let's let's sort of walk through the various component parts of what was said so there's the Greenland piece which it sounds like if he could purchase it he would the question is if he couldn't purchase it or couldn't afford to or something like that would he use military force to somehow get it that's one piece then there's the Panama Canal and then there's Canada as the 51st state in the United States what do you think is even realistic there and let's just even talk about the political implications of all this which is to say the way Canada for example or even the folks in Panama right now are reacting to all of this they're about to I live in Miami my county commissioner Kevin Cabrera is about to be the Panama the Ambassador for the United States to Panama and so he's going to have his hands full I do think that out of the three scenario as you laid out here Trump is most concerned about Panama not only because of China's presence as a global power trade superpower but also because of the Darian gap which is the only land bridge connecting South America with Central and North America therefore and that has been a major migrant throughway and so Donald Trump who is keenly concerned about trade about China and about immigration is looking at Panama and is very concerned about it so I think out of the three that we've discussed here that is the most likely for him to devote more time policy and resources toward what what about the Canada piece though because they are our neighbor they have been uh an ally a great Ally and there are now concerns you read the the papers in Canada turn on the TVs there I was reading or seeing some video that was coming across on social media and they're you know it sounds like they're apoplectic about what's happening I imagine they are I mean Canada for its entire history has lived in fear of its barbaric brother to the South the United States invading it and taking it over it opted not to become part of the United States even though uh a number of our early founding fathers and our early presents wanted it to the conservative leader of Panama and I must said or better said of Canada whose last name is French and I therefore can't pronounce it because I too am one of these barbarians he's even discounted this so this one is a little harder to see out of all of them the Greenland piece is hard for me to see the Panama piece is less hard to see out of all real quick just finally and you were talking about the people around him uh wanting to help him accomplish these things there was a sense in 2016 that there were people around him who didn't want to help him accomplish uh things that he talked about and so that they were almost blocking or preventing certain things are slow walking things how different is that today and how should we think about that I wrote In axios on Monday that his incoming chief of staff was his campaign co-manager Susie WS who's been with him stuck with him to thick and thin she has the understanding of letting Trump be Trump and trying to execute on his vision and hiring people who are loyal to him loyal to his mission and believe in getting things done for him and not undermining him that's why for instance we haven't seen what we would have seen in the past which would have been Anonymous staff leaks saying oh my God this guy is crazy there's no way we're going to do that not hearing that anymore so that's one of the reasons that we have to take the Greenland the Canada and Panama pieces more seriously is because his staff does Mark want to thank you for joining us this morning we will

The realtors had been saying that homebuyers are getting  used to a new normal of higher rates, but that is not showing up to start the new year, at lost least not in mortgage demand.  much of that is because homes  are just sitting on the market much longer. High prices combined with  higher rates are sidelining  would-be buyers. The forecast for this year is  that mortgage rates will fall  modestly, but stay above 6%  with volatility.

Rick?  >> first of all, the yield at  this auction was 4.913.  it was trading 4.92%. Lower  yield and auction the entire price governments to seller, which is a good thing. That yield i told you is the highest yield at a 30 year bond  auction since august 2007. Should yields close anywhere towards the upper end of this  range on a 30 year bond to 493 and 495 area, that will be the highest going back to october  of 2023. If we go to the metrics, it  gets an a on every level.  solid bid to cover and indirect  and extremely solid, dealers take much less then auction  average. They take less than 13% and 10 auction average 15% and this completes the three lanes of 119 billion and coupon supply, so as you look at the charts and see those yields falling,  that makes sense.  we're over the hump of supply  and the concession seems to be how much higher they moved in  the last several days. Don't forget that tomorrow is a  holiday.

              "Communication, though she also said the recent hack of the  treasury doesn't help the  u.s./china relationship. Joining us now with reaction is  ian bremer, he released his new  list of the top political risks  to watch in 2025 the progress that janet yellen has made with her counterparts in china, what happens to that under trump 2.0. >> first, i think she is right to take some credit, you know, the relationship between the u.s. And china got worse before  it got better under the biden  administration, that initial summit they had in anchorage it  was a disaster, china lecturing  them in return and walking out but last year has really been  much more stable, they've worked on the relationship, they've opened 25 high-level bilateral channels including with  treasury, with commerce, defense, very important, and they've done it to stable ides the relationship without the americans giving away the store, tariffs haven't been removed export controls. U.s. Isn't giving up on taiwan you talk to democrats and  republicans on the hill they don't have a lot to criticize  biden about on china and they're not usually shy, right, so i do  think she's right to lean into that, but it's very unlikely in  my view that that relationship,  that state of affairs between  the u.s. And china will persist  with the incoming trump  administration in part because of the orientation of his top  advisers in cabinet and in part  because trump's focus on tariffs which i certainly think he's going to come out swinging in  the early weeks. >> how do you think china reacts to that because on one hand it's very confrontational on the  other hand he invited xi to his  inauguration.  >> trump always talks about how  brilliant xi is as a strong  leader, how much respect he has  for him, not like trump has a  problem meeting with people he doesn't agree with, think about  kim jong-un last time around and trump loves the idea of cutting  deals, but this is a different environment, i think you'll have a really hard time, even though  they'll have pleasant  conversations with what xi is  willing to offer, i'll buy some  soybeans, i'll buy some boeings  if any are being produced, but that's not going to be enough to get the trump administration to  back away from what's a much more hawkish orientation, not  just on china bilaterally but  also in cutting off the chinese  at the knees and the third countries they're shipping goods through to the united states like mexico facing a lot of  pressure on china from the incoming trump administration, india, vietnam, this is  something that the trump economic team is very, very  focused on and it's going to hurt the chinese >> isn't that the whole point  around the tariffs to get around that label washing.  >> that's right. The chinese government felt like they had a pretty good strategy  in doing that and the trump  administration intends to stop it there's an orientation to cut a  deal if the chinese were really  willing to, you know, sort of  take a knee and cry uncle for  the trump administration but i don't think that's going to  happen it's in the mexico or canada and again the symbolic level they're willing to pay off trump to make him go away, but the demands being made by the trump ed administration are must more substantive and structural than  that i'd pay more attention to the  fact that the chinese are doing  a lot with trying to improve their relationship with india. Japan ending the export controls they've had on the seafood they  said was tainted from fukushima. Why are they suddenly doing that all over the world because they're preparing for a  much more challenging  relationship with the united states, and they also note that  there are a lot of countries around t",

              "A crucial time for america's  fiscal future. Joining me here exclusively at  the treasury department is the  treasury secretary, janet  yellen. Thank you so much for having us  here.  >> pleasure. Thanks for the invitation.  >> we were just reminiscing,  here earlier 2021 in the depth  of covid, a lot has changed.  >> a lot has changed.  >> the economy has been  resilient. Interest rates were rising,  inflation was raging and yet,  amazingly the economy has  maintained this 2%, 3% growth,  the question is, why was it a  losing issue for the democrats  in the election? >> well, we have seen really  solid growth and we did  experience a surge in inflation  and most people never lived  through an episode like that,  the level of prices about 20%  higher than pre-pandemic, and of course the rate of inflation has come way down, it's now pretty  close, quite close to the fed's  target. So prices are continuing to rise at anything like that and now  very close to normal. But, people i think have  remember these big price  increases and, you know, they  feel it had a very adverse  effect on their cost of living. Now at this point, wages have  gone up a lot, and if you  compare the typical household  now to pre-pandemic, they can  buy the same basket of goods  they could have had in 2019 with we estimate about $1600 leftover to spare, so in real terms wages have outpaced inflation and now  over the last year or more, on  the consistent basis, wage  increases are outstripping  inflation, but there was a  period in which price increases  were very high. >> i it still feels like because we remember the prices before  covid. Prices at the grocery store are  so much higher. When you look back at it do you  have any regrets about the  fiscal stimulus and extra  spending put in place, adding  fuel to the fire when it comes  to kind of sparking that high  inflation.  >> so, i think it's important to remember what the world looked  like when we entered the  beginning of the biden  administration, weed a a  pandemic that was raging out of  control and thousands of people  were dying on a monthly basis  and the unemployment remained  extremely high and people, many  people who had lost their jobs  although they were being  supported by unemployment  insurance were in a position  they could lose the roof over  their heads and we saw people in cars lining up at food banks to  make sure that they could feed  their families and it was really important to spend the money to  alleviate that suffering to make sure that small businesses  didn't go out of business  because of the pandemic. People would have lost their livelihoods, their businesses  that they had invested in, and we wanted to alleviate all of  that suffering we had seen in past downturns  like the great -- during the great recession that people who  were unemployed for a very long  time become scar, alienated from the workforce, they can never  get their lives back on track, i call that scarring and we wanted to avoid that. I think the spending was necessary. >> did it spark the inflation? >> it may have contributed a little bit to the inflation. But by and large, the inflation  was supplyside phenomena the pandemic had led to  shortages of goods coming from china and other parts of the world, it shut down firms like our auto firms without enough  semiconductors to be able to build cars, so there was simply  huge supply chain problems and goods, critical goods that people wanted were in absolute shortage and i think an  important factor in the  inflation ",

Defense is around a trillion dollar spending. Nondefense iscretionary is close to $900 billion. So, that's $2 trillion right there and maybe feel that  defense spending should go up.

            "GAINS. PREDICTING SOME WILD SWINGS AND  SENTIMENT. JOINING US IS ERIC JOHNSTON FROM CANTOR FITZGERALD. >> CHINA IS UNDERGOING A MASSIVE STIMULUS PACKAGE THAT'S LIKELY  GOING TO GROW OVER THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR, THERE'S AN OVERHANG  RIGHT NOW AROUND TARIFFS AND OUR VIEW IS THAT IT'S IN BOTH  PARTIES' INTEREST TO GET SOME  SORT OF A DEAL AND PROBABLY TO  GET IT RELATIVELY EARLY SO WE  THINK THAT OVERHANG CAN BE  ALLEVIATED BY A DEAL FAIRLY  EARLY IN 2025, AT THE SAME TIME  POSITIONING IS EXTREMELY LOW. IN CHINA. PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN UP ON IT. VALUATIONS ARE SUPERATTRACTIVE  AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS, YOU HAVE A GOVERNMENT WHERE, YOU KNOW,  FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION FOR  THIS STIMULUS PACKAGE, THEY'LL  DO WITH WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET BOTH THE ECONOMY TO STABILIZE  AND TO START GROWING AGAIN AND  ALSO TO GET STOCK PRICES HIGHER  AND I THINK YOU WANT TO BE ON  THE SAME SIDE WITH WHAT THAT  TYPE OF GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING TO DO.  >> THAT'S INTERESTING. IT'S FELT A BIT EXTREME LOOKING  AT RECORD-LOW BUYING YIELDS OVER THERE. THE FLIGHT OF CAPITAL. BUT YOU DO SEE SOMETHING  HAPPENING THERE. MEANTIME, BACK STATESIDE WE'VE  BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE FED PRICING IN TERMS OF CUTS, GOING  AWAY FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE  YEAR, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE  EXPECTING ANY IN FIRST HALF  EITHER.  >> WE'RE NOT. THE MARKET IS PRICING IN ONE CUT IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR,  WE THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON  PAUSE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT SIX  MONTHS, WE WERE NOT NECESSARILY  IN AGREEMENT WITH CUTTINGS THEY  DID ALREADY. I THINK WHAT THEY'RE SEEING,  STILL CPI AND PCS WELL ABOVE 2%. PRICES PAID NUMBER YESTERDAY HIT 64. AND WE HAVE A VERY PRO-GROWTH  ADMINISTRATION COMING IN. THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS FOR  THEM TO TAKE A PAUSE, WAIT AND  SEE, SEE WHAT POLICIES ARE  IMPLEMENTED AND ALSO SEE WHAT  HAPPENS WITH INFLATION. IF INFLATION DOES START TO  RE-ACCELERATE TO THE UPSIDE, I  THINK THE MARKET'S GOING TO HAVE A BIG ISSUE WITH THAT AND I  THINK THERE ARE REASONS TO  BELIEVE THAT'S CERTAINLY A  POSSIBILITY. I THINK THE FED ISN'T GOING TO  WANT TO TAKE A RISK OF CUTTING  EVEN FURTHER UNTIL WE HAVE  EVIDENCE THAT'S NOT THE CASE.  >> ERIC, I'M TRYING TO FIGURE  OUT WHAT YOUR POSTURE IS TOWARD  EQUITIES AT THE MOMENT. MOST OF LAST YEAR I BELIEVE YOU  WERE PRETTY NEGATIVE AND PRETTY  BEARISH ON STOCKS AND THE  OVERALL ECONOMY, HAVE YOU  CHANGED YOUR TUNE? >> SO, IN TERMS OF THE MARKET,  WE HAD A MUCH MORE  TRADING-ORIENTED VIEW, YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR. IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMY, WE  THINK WE'RE IN A LATE CYCLE  ECONOMY, WE STL BELIEVE THAT,  WE ALSO THINK THE NEXT THREE YOU KNOW TO SIX MONTHS WITH THE NEW  ADMINISTRATION COMING IN,  CONFIDENCE SURGING AMONG CEOs. THE WEALTH EFFECT IS PROVIDING A BIG TAIL WIND THERE. BETWEEN HOUSING AND STOCK PRICES THE WEALTH CREATION OVER THE  PAST YOU KNOW CALL IT SIX TO  NINE MONTHS HAS BEEN SO GREAT  THAT WE THINK THAT'S ALSO GOING  TO CARRY FORWARD AND YOU'RE  SEEING THAT IN THE ECONOMIC DATA AND WE THINK THAT CONTINUES AT  LEAST FOR THE NEXT THREE TO SIX  MONTHS AND WE'LL SEE WHERE RATES ARE AN",

              ">>> welcome back to \"squawk on  the street.\"  j.p.  morgan is the latest company  reportedly bringing workers  back to the office five days a  week.  of course, that push to get  workers back to the office in  2025 could be a tailwind for  commercial real estate,  especially right here in new  york city.  scott rechler has got a lot  more on the state of commercial  real estate market in this new  year.  happy new year.  you know i've talked to you in  years past, whether it was 2024  or 2023, you certainly didn't  sound very positive waiting for  the storm to clear so to speak.  the banks to decline in the  value of some of those loans.  >> i think what has happened is  the federal reserve by using  their rhetoric was able to get  the markets loose.  the stop markets up.  the bond markets were open and  the regulators sort of gave  some room.  so this storm sort of hovered  around the coast, but never  actually came onto the coast.  during that period of time, you  saw the big banks, they were  taking reserves.  people were capitulating on  values.  people were estimating where  interest rates were.  so i think '24 is the floor  right now.  '24, we're at this floor where  we're now going to be in  position to start dealing with  these things, but it's not  going to be as distressed as it  was, because the capital has  acknowledged the valuations.  we'll see transaction activity  take place.  >> we will.  but we're sort of at the end of  that, so to speak.  >> i think people who waited in  '24 hoping that interest rates  were going to go low and save  them are going to have a hard  time surviving '25.  for those who say let's go  negotiate with lenders, be  opportunistic, you can thrive  in '25.  we still have a challenge of  all these loans.  $2.3trillion of loans that have  to be refinanced, the bulk of  that over the next three years  at rates that are going to be  much higher than where they  were originally set.  >> you started a distress fund,  i think it was last year.  have you done anything from it?  >> so we've, this year invested  in 9.5 million square feet of  classic office space.  we started by institutional  owners, who just didn't want to  be anything near office was  toxic.  we were buying it at discounted  prices and going to the banks  and renegotiating.  buy great buildings, fix the  capital structures and in  places like new york, you get  them leased.  we work with organizations that  say i see the demand out there,  i don't want to abandon it.  this week, we're going to buy  49% interest in a class a  trophy building with an  institution that says i want to  stay in 51%, but i want to  hedge my bet.  bring in somebody bringing in  good capital, to spend good  money, not bad.  >> have cities been smart about  conversions to the degree that  it's soaking up some of that  eninventory?  >> new invintory?  >> they did put in policies,  the state did and the city of  yes housing program, so you've  seen a dramatic increase of  buildings that actually qualify  for conversion",

KEITH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER  JOINS US NOW.  KEITH, I KNOW YOU'VE LIKED TECH  FOR A WHILE AND REMAIN BULLISH,  BUT TEN YEAR YIELD AT 4.7, DOES  IT CHANGE THINGS?  >> IT DOES SENSE AN INTERNAL  CORRECTION PERIOD THAT'S REALLY  STARTED BACK ON DECEMBER 6th  THAT COINCIDED WITH A LOWER  YIELD.  IT REALLY HASN'T MOVED THAT  MUCH.  REALLY, THE UNCERTAINTY FACTOR  --  >> KEITH, KEITH --  >> YES?  >> KEITH, I'M SORRY, I'VE GOT  TO CUT YOU OFF, BECAUSE YOUR  AUDIO IS ECHOING.  SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FIX  THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU, SO WE  CAN HEAR YOU.  BUT CLEARLY, YOU KNOW, CARL AND  DAVID, THE TEN YEAR MOVE, IT'S  CAUGHT SOME PEOPLE BY SURPRISE.  STOCKS NEVER QUITE LIKE IT WHEN  YOU SEE THIS SHARP FAST MOVE  HIGHER IN THE TEN YEAR AND THE  30 YEAR MOVE.  ESPECIALLY WHEN IT RAISES  QUESTIONS ABOUT SUPPLY AND WHO  IS GOING TO BE BUYERS OF  TREASURY, AND LONG TERM  DEFICITS AND WHAT'S GOING TO  HAPPEN WITH THE NEW  ADMINISTRATION.  THAT FEELS LIKE IT'S LAGGING.  WHEN YOU LOOK AT TECHNOLOGY,  WHICH IS BASED ON FUTURE  VALUATIONS FOR PROFITABILITY,  THERE ARE QUESTIONS.  CARL, YOU MENTIONED THE HALO  AFFECT FROM NVIDIA AT CES, IT'S  COINCIDING WITH MOVING RATES.  >> BOND VOLATILITY, HIGHEST  SINCE NOVEMBER 19th.  I WOULD NOTE A COUPLE COMMENTS  ABOUT VALUATION, THIS WEEK  ALONG FROM HOWARD MARKS AND  GOVERNOR COOK ON MONDAY, SAYING  IN SOME AREAS OF THE MARKET WE  MIGHT BE PRICED FOR PERFECTION  AND VULNERABLE TO A SHARP  DECLINE.  >> YEAH, I THINK THAT CONCERN  CERTAINLY GETS RAISED AT THIS  POINT.  SARAH, YOU RAISED IT AS WELL,  JUST INTEREST COSTS ALSO, WITH  THE EXPECTATION RATES WOULD BE  COMING DOWN.  NO SUCH LUCK AT THIS POINT.  OBVIOUSLY AN OVERALL FOCUS ON  THE BUDGET IS THE DEBTS WE'RE  PAYING ON ROUGHLY $37 TRILLION.  >> I KNOW, IT'S CRAZY.  EVER SINCE THE FEDS START THE  CUTTING RATES THEY'VE GONE ON A  ONE WAY TRAIN HIGHER.  KEITH, YOU'VE FIXED YOUR AUDIO.  ON TECH, WE'RE JUST WONDERING  IF THE 10 YEAR MOVING UP TO  4.7, THE 30 YEAR MOVING TO 5%,  IF THAT CHANGES THINGS AS FAR  AS HOW YOU LOOK AT VALUATIONS  AROUND TECH IN PARTICULAR.  >> SURE, SARAH.  HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HEAR ME NOW.  >>  YES.  >> I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL, OUR  VIEW IS STILL POSITIVE.  I THINK IN THE SHORT TERM BASIS  THE MARKET IS GOING THROUGH A  CORRECTION THAT BEGAN IN LATE  DECEMBER.  IF YOU LOOK AT THE S & P 500 AS  A WHOLE, THE MARKET PEAKED BACK  ON DECEMBER 6th.  THAT'S WHEN YIELDS HAD BOTTOMS.  I DO THINK THIS IS A YEAR TERM  HEADWIND FOR THE OVERALL  MARKET.  YOU ALSO HAD BACK IN DECEMBER,  REALLY HIGH INVESTOR  EXPECTATIONS.  AROUND YOU, WE'RE HAVING A  RESET OF SENTIMENT.  WE STILL THINK THE PRIMARY IS  HIGHER.  YOU LOOK AT TECH, THE MOMENTUM  IS STILL STRONGER THAN THE  OVERALL MARKET.

WE'VE HAD WIND GUSTS AT LEAST A  COUPLE REPORTED ABOVE 100 MILES  AN HOUR.  THAT'S MADE IT VIRTUALLY  IMPOSSIBLE FOR FIREFIGHTERS TO  GET A HANDLE ON THIS ACROSS ANY  OF THESE MAJOR FIRES BURNING IN  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, THERE'S NO  CONTAINMENT.  THEY'RE BURNING THOUSANDS OF  ACRES, BUT THEY'RE BURNING  THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF DENSELY  POPULATED AREAS.  SANTA MONICA IS PARTIALLY UNDER  EVACUATION.  IT'S JUST OUT OF SIGHT HERE.  YOU ACTUALLY CAN'T SEE HARDLY  ACROSS THE PACIFIC COAST  HIGHWAY, BUT THERE'S A COUPLE  OF CONDO BUILDINGS THERE.  WE'VE SEEN EMBERS AND FLAMES  KICK UP.  FIREFIGHTERS SCRAMBLING BACK  AND FORTH.

WHAT IS THE THREAT AT THIS  POINT, OR ARE THE WINDS SORT OF  GOING THE OTHER WAY?  >> Reporter: I MEAN, THE WINDS  ARE GENERALLY MOVING AWAY FROM  SANTA MONICA, BUT THE  EVACUATION DOES EXTEND TO SAN  VICENTE BOULEVARD.

              ">>> welcome back to \"squawk  box.\"  meta platforms announcing it's  going to end third party fact  checking, and moving to user  generated systems, similar to  the notes community program on  x. Some meta employees took to  the in house employees and  expressed their criticism.  one worker said it appeared  meta was sending a message that  facts no longer matter and  conflating that with a victory  for free speech.  joining us right now, chris  kelly, facebook's former chief  privacy officer.  he's the founder of kelly  investments.  let's just start with the  basics.  what did you think when you  first heard this announcement?  >> in many ways, it's a return  to a free speech tradition that  we in many ways tried to  respect, even as we did more  content moderation in the early  days of facebook.  cleaning up the ability to  communicate and being able to  easily present one's views was  a critical part of the network  from the beginning.  and in some ways mark feels  we've gotten away from that.  >> where do you stand on this  issue?  i think there's a question, has  mark's mind evolved, or was  this always where mark's head  sort of us, and maybe some of  the people around him and i'm  thinking of the others that  pushed him in another  direction.  what's this sort of genuine  view of this?  >> i think you have to create a  space?  that allows people to  communicate effectively.  that requires some ability to  push back.  in the american free speech  tradition that is usually with  more free speech, and not in  taking, you know, too much  down.  we always, we never wanted to  be the arbiters of truth.  that's always a hard position  to be in.  you know, but you have to make  sure that, you know, your  community doesn't decline into  a sesspool of accusations back  and forth all the time, and of  the presentation of  misinformation either.  the a.i.  tools that facebook has  deployed, and meta has deployed  over time on all of its  networks still operate here and  there will be addressing of  child sexual abuse material, of  illegal content, things like  that.  >> chris, a huge part of the  decisions in the past, i would  say were business decisions.  business decisions based on at  least a view, maybe wrongly,  but a view that advertisers  wanted this kind of control  over the platform.  or at least people were telling  mark zuckerberg that.  the question now is whether  advertisers will stick with the  platform.  very interestingly, i would  argue to you that x now is  obviously a much broader  platform today to the extent  that it's more free speech  oriented, but it hasn't  necessarily worked as an  advertising platform.  >> i do think the advertisers  are going to continue to  express their opinions, and  they're not going to want to  have their brand advertising in  particular appear next to  offensive material.  i think that will continue to  be a piece of pressure on the  company just as it is on x and  every other platform.  so i don't think that this will  actually end up making a  massive difference in your day- to-day experience on facebook.  >> so you don't think it  changes.  do you think the experience on  x has changed?  >> i do think it has.  and we'll see if that works for  advertisers vertime.  i think there's some  encouraging indications that,  you know, there's some  adaptation that's going on.  the community feature is  excellent, and it's been  implemented very well.  >> there's an interesting  moment yesterday during the  press conference.  on one side, you saw mark  zuckerberg taking to facebook  and instagram, announcing all  of this.  making, i hope a genuine  argument, but then of course,  and saying that he was doing it  in part because politically the  country has moved.  and then three hours later, you  have trump being asked whether  he's ffectively doing this  genuinely or whether he's doing  this because of the threats  that have come from trump, and  he says yeah, probably.  it's probably because he's  doing it under duress.  >> i did see that.  but i do think, having been  there in the initial  discussions, we always wanted  to adhere to the american free  speech tradition, which is more  speech is the answer to  difficult speech.  it was meant -- facebook was  meant ",

              ">> oh, yeah, drew.  it's going to be a good year,  andrew, trust me.  it's going to be a good year.  >> i need you here though.  >> i get tired.  i get tired.  i've got wimpy little  shoulders.  i need help.  >> all right, for more on the  data right now, the market's  rising rates, fed policy, what  to do with all of this, we want  to bring in mohammed el-erian.  what do you think of the data?  what do you think of the feds  reaction and what we're seeing  in treasury right now?  >> first on the data,  consistently, it has been  somewhat stronger and somewhat  hotter than expected, and  that's been a consistent theme.  overall, i'm not worried about  the hotter side, because it's  only hotter relative to an  inflation target that's out- dated.  inflation expectations are  stable.  and i'm really happy about the  stronger side.  yields, they simply reflect the  stronger and hotter economy,  but they also affect issuance,  and i think that we're going to  see yields in the 4 3/4, 5% on  average for this coming year.  pending what we hear from the  new administration.  and the fed, well, the fed has  got to pivot away from this  excessive data dependency, and  take a strategic view, and  rather than fuel volatility,  try to reduce volatility.  and there's too issues the fed  has to navigate right now, one  is monetary policy and two is  the political landscape.  whatever we hear from the fed,  we have to remember they're  navigating two different  things.  not just one.  >> go ahead.  >> i was going to say, but on  the political landscape piece,  it's going to be after whatever  happens.  it's not going to be in advance  of.  >> so they don't want to be  blamed for mortgage rates going  to 7.5, 8%.  they don't want to be blamed  for that.  so we will hear comments that  are more doveish than expected,  because i suspect they are  really worried that they're  going to become a political  target.  >> who is to blame for mortgage  rates going past 7%?  >> it's a combination of  things.  it's a combination of the  hotter inflation.  it's a cbination of the fact  that we continue to out-perform  the rest of the world, and it's  a combination of something that  everybody is waking up to.  the bond vigilantes are waking  up to, which are fiscals out of  control.  >> that is my question.  is 2025 the year that the bond  market really looks in at the  deficits we've been running for  a long time and says no more.  >> i don't think it says no  more, i think it takes it much  more seriously.  if you were sitting in the u k,  you would be much more   worried.  you have a 30 year -- the  memory of the liz trust moment  when suddenly your pension  system -- so i think we worry  less than the rest of the  world, but yes, markets have  woken up to the fact that  deficits and debt are on a  trajectory that shows no sign  of changing at all.  >> will washington recognize  that and try to do anything  about it?  >> i think it's going to take  time.  we are lucky that we are the  cleanest dirty shirt.  so we are still exceptional in  advanced countries.  imagine, becky, where yields  would be had we not attracted  500 billion into the fixed  income market, including from  the rest of the world.  yields would be way up above  5%.  but we're lucky that our  economic exceptionalism is  attracting money into this  country.  >> you started by saying that  an outdated view of inflation  is really the problem here.  that the feds' 2% target is  outdated.  just move the goal posts and  you'll fix everything.  >> first of all, i don't think  we're going to move the goal  post.  they are going to tolerate that  inflation is slightly charger.  it would be in a 2.5 to 3%.  it would be in a range 2.5 to  3. Inflation expectations are  stable.  we don't have an inflation  problem.  we have an inflation issue  relative to a 2% target.  you heard previously, this  notion of sticking inflation,  that's actually stable  inflation.  that doesn't disrupt the  underlying economy in any  fundamental way.  >> are you arguing for them to  cut rates even as inflation is  hotter than they'd been hoping  for?  >> my worry is the opposite.  if they really believe in 2%  inflation, they would hike  rates.  >> so this is an argument  against them hiking rates.  >> correct.  so if they really believed it,  what i think we're going to  hear is yes, we are aiming for  2% inflation, but down the  road, and we're going to  tolerate, we may get one cut  this year, but we should not  want them to be dead set on 2%.  because if they're dead set on  2% the rates are going un.  >> do you up.  >> what would happen in the  markets if either there are no  cuts or they raised cuts?  >> i think we can live with no  cuts.  i think we've adjusted  dramatically.  from a year ago, we were  expecting 6 to 8 cut.  now we're expecting 1 to 2. The  market has all the way back to  july.  this economy remains robust.  >> we got the headlines from  waller's speech today about  what he's going to be talking  about.  i have to say, i was a little  surprised it was more doveish  than i had anticipated.  because they've worked so hard  to try and get to the point  where the market is not  expecting them to cut rates at  every meeting.  this sounded more doveish.  and raised more questions about  this.  i don't know what you thought  about his comments.  >> i was as surprised as you  were.  i do know, if i'm sitting in  the fed right now, i have to  navigate two landscapes.  monetary policy and politics.  >> there's a lot of people that  are nodding with you, because  we can deflate our way out of  some of the step, but the  difference between 2% and 3%  compounded pour the dollar is  devastating.  for you to just blow it off is  a little weird.  there's a reason they want 2%.  anyone can move goal posts.  that's 5% higher than 2%.  >> do you know where 2% comes  from?  >> 3%, it would make all of us  feel awful in ten years.  >> 2% comes from the bank of  new zealand in the '90.  it's an arbitrary number.  >> 5 is an arbitrary number, if  you want to deflate 36  trillion, let's go to 10 hen.  >> i don't want to pull the rug  from under u.s. Economic  exceptionalism.  >> you're starting to at 3%.  >> i think we are investing in  the economies of tomorrow in  the growth drivers of tomorrow.  >> the government?  >> no, the private sector,  everything else.  if you push this economy --  >> the private sector is not  what causes inflation.  >> joe, if you push this  economy into recession, you  would not just lose current  standard of living, you lose  future standard of living.  2.5 to 3 is what i said.  you immediately went to 3. As  long as inflation expectations  are stable, you can navigate.  >> better buy some bitcoin,  mohamed.  >> he did.  >> not enough.  >> none of us did.  damn.  >> what do you think of the  michael barr situation?  >> so i think that is a -- that  is someone taking one for the  fed.  i think he stepped down to  protect the fed to again help  na",

JOINING US FOR THE LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS GOING ON UNTIL THE  DEADLINE IS THE SEO CONSULTING  FIRM KRISTOF AND COMPANY.  SHE HAS WORKED ON THE HILL FOR  JOHN McCAIN AND IN SILICON  VALLEY FOR GOOGLE, UBER, AND  SALESFORCE.  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.  WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN THE  NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS IN YOUR  VIEW?  >> WHAT WILL HAPPEN, IN MY VIEW  IS THE SUPREME COURT'S WILL  UPHOLD THE BAN.  IT IS A WELL-WRITTEN LAW.  THE FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENTS  ARE TOTALLY FAILED.  THEY HAVE NO REAL REASON NOT TO  OF BEEN.  PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS WEIGHED IN  WITH AMICUS BRIEF ASKING THEM  TO DELAY.  I THINK IT GOES FORWARD ON  JANUARY 19.  >> WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN AT THAT  POINT?  >> WE DON'T KNOW IF EXACTLY  WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE FOR  USERS.  IT MEANS THAT THE APP STORES  CAN NO LONGER LET PEOPLE  DOWNLOAD IT.  APPLE AND GOOGLE.  YOU WILL SELECT TIK TOK ON YOUR  PHONE, WHETHER OR NOT IT WILL  WORK IS TO BE SEEN.  IT IS UP TO TIK TOK WITH WHAT  THEY DO WITH USER DATA.  YOU WILL HAVE A WORSE AND WORSE  PRODUCT EXPERIENCE.  YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UPGRADE  IT.  IT COULD JUST GO DARK, WE DON'T  KNOW.  >> THIS HAPPENS, YOU GO ONE  MONTH AFTER THAT, AND IT IS  OKAY AGAIN, CAN HUMPTY DUMPTY  GO BACK TOGETHER AGAIN?  >> IT COULD BE PAUSED BY THE  PRESIDENT AFTER HE IS  INAUGURATED.  THERE IS A PROVISION FOR A 90  DAY PAUSE.  IF HE SAYS, LISTEN, THEY'RE  LOOKING TO THE SOFT, HE COULD  PUT A PAUSE ON IT.  THIS REPORT IS THE HIGHEST  COURT OF THE LAND.  TO UNDO THIS, THEY WOULD NEED A  NEW LAW FROM CONGRESS.  >> I THINK YOU WOULD DO THAT,  RIGHT?  HE IS READY TO ANNEX CANADA,  THIS DOES NOT SEEM LIKE MUCH OF  A STRETCH.  >> MAKE A POINT, HE HAS BEEN  BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS LIKE THE  GULF OF MEXICO.  ALSO, IMMIGRATION, TARIFFS, AND  NOW THEY TALK ABOUT PARDONS  THIS CANNOT BE THE TOP OF THE  PRIORITY LIST.  HE COULD HIT PAUSE AS IF HE  COULD GET A LEGISLATIVE  SOLUTION OR NEGOTIATE  SOMETHING.  YOU WANT TO TALK DIRECTLY WITH  THE CHAIRMAN TO DO THAT.  HE IS INDICATING THAT HE WANTS  TO DO THAT.  HE HAS 14 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON  TIK TOK.  >> HE DOESN'T LIKE IT BECAUSE  IT HELPED.  BARON TRUMP TOLD HIM, YOU HAVE  TO DO TIK TOK.  >> HE HAS ALL OF THAT BITCOIN  FTX MONEY.  >> HE'S GOT ALL THAT BITCOIN  MONEY.  FTFC.  I FORGOT ALREADY.  >> FTX.  >> YEAH, THAT'S WHAT.  TOO MANY LETTERS.  IS IT -- ARE THEY STEALING  EVERYTHING THAT THERE IS TO  KNOW ABOUT OUR YOUTH IN THIS  COUNTRY, AND USING IT TO  SUBVERT THE FUTURE OF THE  UNITED STATES OR NOT?  THAT'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.  THAT WAS THE WHOLE IDEA.  IT HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING.  AND IF SO, THEN IT DOESN'T  MATTER WHETHER IT HELPED WIN AN  ELECTION.  IT'S AN INSIDIOUS THING THAT  PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE AROUND.  WHICH IS IT?  >> WELL ONE THING THAT WE DON'T  KNOW IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN  THOSE NATIONAL SECURITY  BRIEFINGS.  SO WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED, A  NUMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT  AGENTS WERE SKEPTICAL.  THEY SAID I'M SUPPORTING THIS  LAW.  PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SEEN THOSE  BRIEFINGS.  WE HAVE NOT SEEN THEM.  IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT THE  CCP HAS SHOWN THEY ARE  INTERESTED IN, AND ACTIVE IN  MANIPULATING PUBLIC DISCORD IN  THE UNITED STATES.  NOW THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SEEMS  TO SHRUG THIS OFF.  170MILLION PEOPLE DON'T MIND  HAVING A SURVEILLANCE DEVICE IN  THEIR POCKET, IT SEEMS, BUT  THEY HAVEN'T SEEN ALL THE  EVIDENCE.  WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT, MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS HAVE, BOTH PRESIDENT  BIDEN AND TRUMP HAVE SEEN THAT  INFORMATION.  >> NICKY IS IT POSSIBLE THAT  ALL THE PHONES ARE SENDING  INFORMATION TO THE DRONES?  >> IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY ARE  VIOLATING TERMS OF SERVICE FROM  THE APP STORES AND COLLECTING  THINGS ON ALL OF OUR PHONES.  ANYONE IN WASHINGTON, WHERE I'M  BASED WHO WORKS IN NATIONAL  SECURITY DOES NOT TOUCH TIKTOK.  THEY BELIEVE THAT IT COULD  SCRAPE INFORMATION.  I THINK MOST TEENAGERS DON'T  CARE.  >> RIGHT.  THEY DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHINA'S GOING  TO GET FROM LOOKING AT WHAT  TEENS TALK ABOUT.  NOT A WHOLE LOT.  IF THEY DO LOOK AT IT, THEY  PROBABLY SAY, WE DON'T HAVE TO  DO ANYTHING.  U.S. IS GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY.  GO AHEAD.  >> ONE LAST THING IS PRESIDENT  TRUMP HAS SAID OVER AND OVER IS  ONE OF HIS BIG CONCERNS IS THIS  IS A BOONE TO INSTAGRAM.  MARK ZUCKERBERG IS THE BIGGEST  BENEFICIARY OF THIS BAN.

              "Slowing to 4.6%.  that's the slowest pace of  gains since july of 2021.  for those who moved jobs, pay  growth was roughly in line with  last month.  that's at 7.1%.  for more on the adp data, i  want to bring in neil  richardson, ad p's chief  economist, who has been keeping  these numbers secret.  what do you think?  how should we actually think  about this?  the market is doing a little  bit better actually on the back  of this.  but that may be a bad news is  good news situation.  >> it's hard to know when you  incorporate the fed.  from our perspective, what  we've seen all year is very  stable hiring.  we saw a pick up in october.  this december report definitely  represents a down shift from  what we saw earlier in the  quarter.  but it's still a solid number.  pockets of weakness are  something to watch.  manufacturing shed jobs for  three consecutive months.  that's concerning.  this is a sector that could  benefit from a rate cut.  what's doing the heavy lifting  in services is no longer  leisure and hospitality.  we think that game is over.  it's really healthcare.  healthcare is not cyclical.  it's tied to, i think,  demographic hiring.  so you take these two, the good  sector and the service sector.  service is being driven by the  democrat demographics.  manufacture i think very much  focuses on the short term.  >> if you were sitting here in  three months though, from now,  based on these trends, what do  you see happening?  because i think that's what  we're really trying to  understand.  >> you know, first of all, i  think when you really want to  know what's going on in the  labor market, you have to shift  from jobs to wages.  because wages are going to tell  the story of what the fed will  do next.  what we saw was a step down in  wage growth, particularly for  job sayers.  4.6%.  that's a very slow pace of job  growth -- i mean, excuse me,  wage growth.  but not slow enough to be  consistent with a 2% inflation  target.  so that means one of two  things.  either wage growth has to come  down significantly over the  next three months for the fed  to feel comfortable cutting  rates, or we're going to get  into the situation where the  fed has to pause and wait for  the labor market to come along  with this rate cut.  >> did you hear christopher  waller's comments this morning  that he's going to be giving a  speech a little later today?  i was a little surprised that  he still seems to be leaving  the door open to several more  rate cuts this year.  >> given the uncertainty on the  policy front, i think leaving  the door open is a wise move  for the federal reserve.  honestly, they've been leaving  the door open being data  dependent is basically saying  i'm opening the doors and the  windows and seeing if there's a  next data point.  >> although it feels like the  market has been expecting these  rate cuts and they've been  trying to maybe talk themself  out of a position where they  are expected to cut it every  rate meeting.  this seems like it was a swing  back in the other direction.  >> six months ago, i think the  foregone conclusion was that  the fed would move like the fed  has in the past, which is  moderately and consistently,  every single meeting was a rate  cut.  they've channeled that.  that might not be the case.  there may be pauses on the way.  this has been a bumpy  deceleration in wage growth.  i believe it will be a bumpy  deceleration in the interest  rate as well.  >> bumpy, because the data has  been bumpy too.  >> absolutely.  we've seen pockets of strength  and pockets of weakness.  we saw a big surge i",

              "The answer, royal caribbean  icon of the seas the ship is  1196 feet long and 219 feet  wide.  >>> speaker mike johnson is  looking to pass a  reconciliation package through  congress by april.  join us on the gop game plan  and present electrons agenda is  house republican policy  committee chair, kevin hern.  congressman,  it is good to see  you.  will be one or two at this  point?  what is your best guess?  >> what is the issue today, we  have been given the gift of the  opportunity to be in this place  to pass a reconciliation bill  and do things like extend the  tax cuts, and secure the  southern border, get energy  dominance back where was 4  years ago.  we have not been given as a  gift of time.  we need to get these tax cuts  extended by the end of the year  for every single business will  see a rise in causes money  comes blowing back to  washington, d.c. If you look  back, the fastest way to get  that done in the house is one  bill as trump says, one big  beautiful bill so we get  everybody's interest taken care  of as we move forward.  >> that would include a debt  limit increase, as well as $2.5  trillion in net cuts to  spending.  is that possible?  for we believe so.  we have more spending cuts  aligned up than that.  that seems to be the middle of  the road or on the low end.  it ranges from 2 trillion to 5  trillion.  we are looking at releasing  lands to be drilled on,  permitting processes that are  really important, and these are  things that are impactful.  a lot of the money that you saw  the biden administration, or  saw them spend on illegal  immigration, was president  trump order policies, that  would slow down or stop.  a lot of spending cuts that we  could pull in to offset the  cost of extending the tax cuts.  as for we go through the same  process where someone decides on what is a budget  reconciliation, i remember the  democrats loved this pv uses a  lot recently.  if someone has to decide what  can go in there, right?  for they do.  the budget reconciliation  process was part of the 1974  budget control act.  it was a failsafe if you cannot  come through the budget and the  authorizations and  appropriations to hit september  30 each year.  they gave another avenue.  it requires very narrow  language.  as being impactful to the  budget.  that is is in a process,  c.d.o.t.  to have the 60 vote rule on the  filibuster.  the commentary in the senate  will control what gets into the  reconciliation framework.  and the house, the ways and  means and tax quality  subcommittee is that on will be  working make sure that the tax  cuts fit into the  reconciliation process, along  with energy and commerce, and  10 other committees.  >> can you guarantee the  parliamentarian will let all of  the border security provisions  in there as well?  >> not all, because we looked  at hr 2 that the house and did  pass back in march 2023,  overwhelmingly, in a very  narrow margin, we had a three  vote margin, now we have about  two.  we are getting accustomed to  working with the 99% approval  ratings to get a bill passed.  there are things in there that  are not impactful to the  budget, they are more policy.  you cannot pass policy in a  budget reconciliation process.  went to strip out those ideas  that were in there with the  bills that it pass to the  senate to make sure we get only  things in there that will have  a budget impact.  for if it was two bills,  something to be in the second  bill?  then you would need 60?  how would you do that?  you can do that?  >> if you have the second  reconciliation bill, it might  be something, things you might  have to look at the did not get  into the first bill. You find a  way to present it to the  parliamentarian where they  might accept it.  that's why so important to get  one bill done early and start  working on that and try to get  it done by memorial day. This  is a lot of work, as is of the  opening, we are not given the  gift of time.  all tax cuts expire on december  31 of this year.  every single american and small  business will see a small tax  increase if we don't get it  done.  it is important.  this should be a bipartisan  process.  the democrats should all people  have tax increases.  we are working hard.  we will see what happens.  for where will the corporate  scope?  is there some of for that?  to go to next year? is it  possible to do that?  >> is it possible to go from 21  to 15 on the corporate tax rate  just for domestic producers?  is that would be in there?  >> we want to look at it, that  is an additional campaign  conversation that the president  had, just like no tax on tips  and no tax on social security.  those are things we had to  figure out if they can fit n.  we will do that as we get the  legislation moving forward to  going to the reconciliation  package and see what fits in  there, and how we square.  cbo committee on taxation look  at those.  those are important as we move  forward.  we are working passionately to  do as much as we possibly can  on president trump's campaign  promises.  for in terms of pay for some of  you know if there is any  agreement or areas you think  you can get agreement on pay  force to make up for the  givebacks and taxes?  how do we do that in a balanced  fashion?  >> we saw some of that is in hr  1 last year.  the republican house did pass  that, the number one priority,  which was energy dominance.  that is something that  president trump work on.  we heard president trump across  all the campaign trail city  went to across america, talking  about the way we would fix our  way out of this going forward,  using minerals under our feet,  oil and gas, and other mining  opportunities that we have.  looking at how we can release  those, we are very dependent on  the congo for cobalt and china  for processing that coba",

              "Latest, the doctor says while  the bidens last-minute $306  million package to find bird  flu is welcome news, there is  much more to be done when  president-elect trump takes  office.  joining is now the fda  commissioner.  he is also a pfizer board  member and a cnbc contributor.  scott, let's talk this through.  we talk you and last week, you  said  you were not that  concerned about bird flu  becoming a huge threat for  humans.  has that changed at all?  is your take changed since we  heard of the first human that  died of bird flu?  >> that has not changed.  this is a low probability risk.  it could be a high impact  event, and the thing we want to  take steps to mitigate.  there are things we can do and  could have been doing, going  boards reduce the risk that  this could spread into humans.  we need to be testing more on  farms to turn over the cases  and isolate cows that become  infected and chicken flocks as  well.  we need to do more to help  farmers protect dairy workers  be providing swabs to dairy  workers so they can diagnose  themselves.  the thing you worry about is  people becoming co-infected  with this virus and seasonal  influenza.  you get the combination of the  viruses, that would enable the  virus to spread more easily.  that's what happened in 2009.  that was the combination  between the swine flu and  seasonal influenza.  to happen in a pig and then it  became a pandemic strain.  want to mitigate the risks.  you want to do more on the  therapeutic side.  we did stockpile tamiflu, but  not the whole range of  antivirals that could be  effective.  if you look in the journal  medicine in the case reports  two weeks ago, one patient  became very sick in louisiana  canada.  the strength became resistant  to tamiflu as virus continue to  progress in those two patients.  you want to have multiple  antivirals. We have not done  that.  there is a lot we could be  doing to mitigate the risk that  we have not done.  or we have done a late in the  process.  >> why do you think that is?  for there was a tug-of-war  between human health  regulators, public health  regulators, cdc, and other  health agencies and  agricultural officials that felt this would burn out on the  farms.  they did not want to take steps  that would be costly and  burdensome to the farmers.  this is very structural. This  happens all the time between  human health and animal health  regulators.  i had challenges getting my  inspectors on produce farms for  example we had outbreaks of e.  coli are response.  they were reluctant to let  federal regulators on the farms  to isolate what fields were  contaminated.  you see the ension play out  all the time.  there really was a presumption  among the animal health  officials that this would burn  its way through the dairy herd  and eventually be extinguished.  that has not happened.  it has become endemic.  we are seeing it in migratory  birds.  the two patient became very  sick, the one in canada and the  one in louisiana have the  strain that was in migratory  birds.  i am speculating here, but it  is likely because they got sick  by inhaling dry feces from the  birds.  so far, the infections on the  dairy farms have been  conjunctivitis.  it is not getting into the  lower airways.  >> do you think that the state  and local officials and the  animal control officials have  changed their mind about the  concern level here?  if they don't, is there  anything that will get done?  >> there are indications that  they have changed their mind  that the state level.  we see states doing aggressive  testing of dairy cattle.  we have also seen the  implementation in the last  month, in december, a full  testing of milk at the federal  level.  animal health officials  recognized they needed to take  aggressive steps on the farms.  the other thing we could be  doing is increasing the  compensation for affected dairy  farms.  the farmers not be bearing the  brunt of doing the right thing.  they are on the front lines.  they should not bear the  economic rent -- bronx of  calling animals and testing for ",

              "TRUMP RENEWING HIS CALL TO GAIN  U.S. CONTROL OF GREENLAND, ALSO  THE PANAMA CANAL, MAYBE EVEN  CANADA. YESTERDAY HE DECLINED TO RULE  OUT USING MILITARY AND ECONOMIC  COERCION TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. JOINING US RIGHT NOW WITH MORE  ON ALL OF THIS MARK CAPUTO, A  SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER FOR  AXIOS. GOOD MORNING TO YOU. WE WERE DEBATING A LITTLE BIT OF THIS EARLIER IN THE BROADCAST,  MARK, AND I THINK WE'RE ALL  TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH OF THIS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE  SERIOUSLY, HOW MUCH WE'RE  SUPPOSED TO TAKE AS SORT OF  TRUMP DOCTRINE, NEGOTIATING  POSTURE OF SORTS. HOW DO YOU VIEW IT? >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS  SAID IN 2016 IS NOT TO TAKE  TRUMP OR THAT HIS VOTERS DIDN'T  ALWAYS TAKE TRUMP LITERALLY,  THEY TOOK HIM FIGURATIVELY. I THINK BY NOW WE HAD 12, 13  YEARS OF THIS WE SHOULD REALIZE  IT'S BOTH. YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIM LITERALLY,  YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIM  FIGURATIVELY, YOU HAVE TO TAKE  HIM SERIOUSLY AND SOMETIMES YOU  HAVE TO TAKE HIM UNSERIOUSLY. SO THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR  QUESTION IS I DON'T KNOW, I  DON'T THINK ANY OF US KNOWS. THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE'RE GOING  TO ACQUIRE GREENLAND WHEN WE  HAVE TRILLIONS IN DEBT AND A  HUGE BUDGET DEFICIT IS PRETTY  SLIM CONSIDERING THE NARROW  MARGINS IN CONGRESS BECAUSE,  AFTER ALL, CONGRESS WILL  PROBABLY NEED TO DO SOMETHING  ABOUT TAKING OVER NEW TERRITORY. BUT NEVERTHELESS, TRUMP WANTS TO DO THIS IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR  FORM AND UNLIKE ADMINISTRATIONS  AND CAMPAIGNS PAST, DONALD TRUMP HAS A STAFF AND STRUCTURE AROUND HIM THAT SAYS, WELL, IF DONALD  TRUMP SAYS IT, THEN WE WILL TRY  TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.  >> HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH? I WONDER WHAT THE BLUE BOOK IS. AND YOU REMEMBER --  >> I HAVE NO IDEA.  >> IF IT'S NOT THAT MUCH MONEY,  I DISAGREE THAT THE BUDGET  DEFICIT WOULDN'T ALLOW IT. IT CERTAINLY ALLOWS US TO SPEND  A LOT OF MONEY ON OTHER THINGS,  LIKE HELP FOR UKRAINE, HELP FOR  OTHER PLACES. >> SURE.  >> WE SPENT -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE SPENT ON ALASKA, BUT IT  WAS -- IT WAS CALLED A FOLLY AT  THE TIME, I THINK -- DO YOU  REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS? IT WAS IN THE MILLIONS. I DON'T EACH ANY IT WAS IN THE  BILLIONS WHEN IT HAPPENED. ONE OF THE GREAT PURCHASES,  OBVIOUSLY, OF ALL TIME. GREENLAND, IF IT COULD BE  DONE -- IF YOU COULD -- YOU  KNOW, WE TALK ABOUT COERCION,  MAKE THEM AN OFFER THEY CAN'T  REFUSE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY? >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WELL, IN THE CASE OF SEWARD,  BUYING SQUA, CZARIST RUSSIA  WANTED TO SELL IT. IN THE CASE OF GREENLAND THEY  DON'T WANT TO.  >> $7 MILLION.  >> I WILL TAKE TWO, RIGHT? >> EXACTLY. >> BUT IN THE IT'S NOT JUST  WHETHER WE CAN AFFORD IT OR NOT, IT'S WHETHER CONGRESS THINKS WE  CAN AFFORD IT OR NOT. THERE ARE NARROW MARGINS IN  CONGRESS. IT'S JUST DIFFICULT TO SEE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT DONALD  TRUMP ISN'T SERIOUS ABOUT IT OR, YOU KNOW, GRADING ON A DONALD  TRUMP CURVE WHETHER HE'S  SERIOUSLY MUSING ABOUT IT, BUT  WE SHOULD TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND  ONCE HE BEGAN TALKING ABOUT THIS AGAIN -- REMEMBER HE DISCUSSED  THIS IN 2018 AND 2019. PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE HIM  SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT. >> MARC, LET'S WALK THROUGH THE  VARIOUS COMPONENT PARTS OF WHAT  WAS SAID. SO THERE IS THE GREENLAND PIECE  WHICH IT SOUNDS LIKE IF HE COULD PURCHASE IT, HE WOULD. THE QUESTION IS IF HE COULDN'T  PURCHASE IT OR COULDN'T AFFORD  TO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WOULD HE USE MILITARY FORCE TO SOMEHOW GET IT? THAT'S ONE PIECE. THEN THERE'S THE PANAMA CANAL  AND THEN THERE'S CANADA AS THE  51st STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS EVEN  REALISTIC THERE? AND LET'S EVEN TALK ABOUT THE  POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF ALL OF THIS, WHICH IS TO SAY THE WAY  CANADA, FOR EXAMPLE, OR EVEN THE FOLKS IN PANAMA RIGHT NOW ARE  REACTING TO ALL OF THIS. >> THEY'RE -- I LIVE IN MIAMI. MY COUNTY COMMISSIONER, KEVIN  CABRERA IS ABOUT TO BE THE  AMBASSADOR FOR THE UNITED STATES TO PANAMA AND SO HE'S GOING TO  HAVE HIS HANDS FULL. I DO THINK THAT OUT OF THE THREE SCENARIOS YOU LAID OUT HERE  TRUMP IS MOST CONCERNED ABOUT  PANAMA. NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF CHINA'S  PRESENCE AS A GLOBAL POWER TRADE SUPER POWER, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE DARION GAP, THE ONLY LAND  BRIDGE CONNECTING SOUTH AMERICA  WITH CENTRAL AND NORTH AMERICA,  THEREFORE. THAT HAS BEEN A MAJOR MIGRANT  THROUGH WAY. SO DONALD TRUMP WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT TRADE, CHINA AND  IMMIGRATION, IS LOOKING AT  PANAMA AND IS VERY CONCERNED  ABOUT IT. I THINK OUT OF THE THREE WE'VE  DISCUSSED HERE THAT IS THE MOST  LIKELY FOR HIM TO DEVOTE MORE  TIME, POLICY AND RESOURCES  TOWARD.  >> WHAT ABOUT THE CANADA PIECE,  THOUGH? BECAUSE THEY ARE OUR NEIGHBOR,  THEY HAVE BEEN AN ALLY, A GREAT  ALLY, AND THERE ARE NOW  CONCERNS -- YOU READ THE PAPERS  IN CANADA, TURN ON THE TVs  THERE, I WAS READING -- OR  SEEING SOME VIDEO THAT WAS  COMING ACROSS ON SOCIAL MEDIA  AND THEY'RE -- YOU KNOW, IT  SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE APOPLECTIC  ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING.  >> I IMAGINE THEY ARE. CANADA FOR ITS ENTIRE HISTORY  HAS LIVED IN FEAR OF ITS  BARBARIC BROTHER TO THE SOUTH,  YOU UNITED STATES, INVADING IT  AND TAKING IT OVER. IT OPTED NOT TO BECOME PART OF  THE UNITED STATES EVEN THOUGH A  NUMBER OF OUR EARLY FOUNDING  FATHERS AND OUR EARLY PRESIDENTS WANTED IT TO. THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER OF  PANAMA -- OR BETTER SAID OF  CANADA WHOSE LAST NAME IS FRENCH SO I THEREFORE CAN'T PRONOUNCE  IT BECAUSE I, TOO, AM ONE OF  THESE BARBARIANS HE HAS EVEN  DISCOUNTED IT. THIS ONE IS HARDER TO SEE OUT OF ALL OF THEM. THE GREENLAND PIECE IS HARD TO  SEE, THE PANAMA IS LESS HARD TO  SEE OUT OF ALL THREE.  >> YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE  PEOPLE AROUND HIM WANTING HIM TO ACCOMPLISH THESE THINGS. THERE WAS A SENSE IN 2016 THERE  WERE PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHO  DIDN'T WANT TO HELP HIM  ACCOMPLISH THINGS THAT HE TALKED ABOUT.  >> CORRECT.  >> THEY WERE ALMOST BLOCKING OR  PREVENTING CERTAIN THINGS OR  SLOW WALKING THINGS. HOW DIFFERENT IS THAT TODAY AND  HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THAT? >> I WROTE IN AXIOS ON MONDAY  THAT HIS INCOMING CHIEF OF STAFF WAS HIS CAMPAIGN CO-MANAGER  SUSIE WILES STUCK WITH HIM  THROUGH THICK AND THIN. SHE HAS THE UNDERSTANDING OF  LETTING TRUMP BE TRUMP AND  TRYING TO EXECUTE ON HIS VISION  AND HIRING PEOPLE WHO ARE LOYAL  TO HIM, LOYAL TO HIS MISSION AND BELIEVE IN GETTING THINGS DONE  FOR HIM AND NOT UNDERMINING HIM. THAT'S WHY, FOR INSTANCE, WE  HAVEN'T SEEN WHAT WE WOULD HAVE  SEEN IN THE PAST, WHICH WOULD  HAVE BEEN ANONYMOUS STAFF LEAKS  SAYING, OH, MY GOD, THIS GUY IS  CRAZY. THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT. NOT HEARING THAT ANYMORE. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT  WE HAVE TO TAKE THE GREENLAND,  THE CANADA AND PANAMA PIECES ",

              "Wharton school of business.  he's also a cnbc contributor.  thank you for joining us on the  show today.  >> happy to be here.  >> i want to get your initial  reaction to what we heard from  mark zuckerberg.  he mentioned that the steps  they will be taking will be  similar to x. What was your  take on what he had to say?  >> similar kind of take, frank.  i think what we're seeing here  is not super surprising, we're  looking at a tech company who  is basically saying listen, we  have to make sure that we are  not in regulatory harms way  here and so it's been very  clear that the president-elect  has stated very clearly that  listen, you are with us or  you're not.  so there is this retaliatory,  sort of flavor out there that i  think many of the tech  companies responding to.  it's not surprising, because i  think it is pretty normal for  most companies to say, you  know, when a new presidential  administration comes in, we  want to make sure we are  aligned for sure.  what is critical here, frank,  is the idea that this is really  the critical question that  facebook and meta has been  facing for a long time, which  is to say listen, are we a news  platform or are we a vehicle  where information flows  through?  i think we're about to get our  answer on that.  >> all right, so we're spending  a lot of time looking what the  possible motivations are,  whether trying to line itself  with the incoming  administration or be more like  x. I want to ask you, someone  who is a marketing expert, is  there a business reason to do  this?  there's been a public relations  impact.  is there a business reason to  do all this?  >> there absolutely is a  business reason to do this,  frank.  let my lay this out quickly.  i think a couple of things.  it costs a lot of money to  police free speech, free speech  in the social media platforms.  you have to pay monitors, you  have to set up automated  algorithms to check across a  wide area of high scaled users,  millions, billions of users and  things of that nature.  so that's a cost.  that's a real expense that you  can scale back if you're doing  this.  so from that perspective,  economically, that also makes  sense.  i think it also makes sense  from the perspective of the  idea that at least for half the  population, as you know, there  is too much of this free  speech, you know, there isn't  enough of this free speech  advocacy and too much wokism.  those consumers will say, you  know what?  i may be more -- i may look at  the platform now more  favorablely because now i see  it as aligned with my own views  on the ability to say whatever  it is you want to say out  there.  so i think there's two reasons.  there's a consumer reason that  says those advocates of free  speech will be more attracted  to the platform.  those operational costs that  could be reduced, frank, are  significant in terms of what  meta is facing.  >> thinking about 95% of the  revenues from ads.  how do you see it impacting  that part of the business?  not fact checking is cost  cutting, but what about the  revenues coming in?  do you see the fact they are  shifting more towards x and i  want your take on how x is  operating now.  if they are shifting toward x,  what does that mean for future  revenue growth?  >> it's a great question,  frank.  there are two forces here that  are going on.  the first will be, there will  be a group of enterprise  organizations that will say, we  can't be on that platform.  we saw that with x, ibm and  other companies that said hey,  we can't allow our messages to  be coinciding with other things  that might be seen as hate  speech or might be detrimental  to our brand.  there is that, sort of, that  reaction that is going to say,  you know, we'll pull back.  some companies will pull back  and say, we don't want to be on  the platform advertising.  however, there will be  additional counteraffect of  that, which will be companies  that say, we do want to be  there because they may brand  themselves or see themselves,  frank, as kind of this antiwoke  kind of brand.  parallel economy kinds of  brands.  those brands are probably going  to be more attractive.  we'll see some companies  dropping off because of the  effects to their brands and  their ideological points of  view.  but we'll also see some brands  coming on board more so as  advertising opportunities  because of the fact they see  alignment with meta's new  policies in terms of scaling  back these different  approaches.  >> you know, interesting  intersection between commerce  and culture when it comes to  this decision from meta.  i have one last question for  you.  you work down there in  philadelphia.  where ",

              "Let's bring in megan chu.  megan, good to see you.  >> good morning, frank, thanks  for having me.  >> megan, how do you see today,  this week shaping up?  what's your word of the day?  >> yeah, so i think my word of  the day is quality.  i think that really describes  the environment that we are  dealing with in at least the  first quarter, probably the  first half of this year.  the way i think about it, and  redefine quality is companying  generating really strong,  sustainable earnings while also  carrying low levels of  leverage.  so, the two most likely  scenarios are inflation  continues to come down.  the economy softens a little  bit, and the fed cuts much more  than what we are expecting.  in that environment, where you  get a softer growth outlook,  you really want those companies  that are generating  sustainable, strong earnings.  but if we're wrong and the  market is more right and rates  stay elevated for longer and  the fed is not cutting very  much, if at all next year, then  i think you really need to be  focusing on companies that do  not rely on interest rate  sensitive debt or their  borrowing needs and higher  quality companies tend to carry  much higher levels of overall  cash.  i think it's a win/win.  that's why higher quality is a  theme we're focused on.  >> i want to go back to your  base case.  i think people now are thinking  it's two cuts, maybe just one  cut.  inflation appears to be  stickier than we thought it  was.  on your base case at least,  where do you get confidence  that inflation is going down,  especially after the read  yesterday, we saw companies are  preparing for tariffs and  prices are going up.  >> well, in all honesty, and  full disclosure, yesterday's  data did not work toward our  base case, where we not only  had pryer prices paid in the  services, but we got an uptick  in the jolt survey, and what  we're working on the inflation  front is really the underlying  price pressures.  if you look at categories of  housing and then everything  housing.  housing continues to come down.  it's stickier than we would  like.  if you look at the categories  outside of housing, that has  been at or below the fed's  target for a number of months  now, and we just do not see the  conditions that would really be  necessary, the inflations stay  here or even reaccelerate,  which is the fed's concern.  labor market --  >> meghan, i want to make time  to talk about this.  your pick for today.  what is your pick and why?  >> my pick is banks.  this is another sort of, i  think win/win for the year  ahead.  banks were a key part of the  broadening story we saw in the  second half of last year.  we expect rates to stay  elevated.  we think short rates will come  down.  you'll get really a nice rate  environment and a steeper curve  for banks.  the thing to watch wil",

              "And owns palantir, gentleman,  good morning, great to have you  both here.  maalik, i'm going to start off  with you.  one of the issues you have, is  the evaluation of palantir, at  150 times.  is there any other big issue  with this company, other than  this really elevated  evaluation?  >> to be very honest with you,  first of all, good morning.  to be honest, we think about  palantir's business, it is one  of the only ai places out  there.  the company business is great,  the u.s. Commercial side of the  business is actually doing  really well, and firing on all  cylinders.  our issue with palantir, as a  stock has been the evaluation.  that's what we highlighted over  the last few quarters, the  evaluation is getting out of  hand.  especially if you think about  trying to take into the stock  price, those are some very  optimistic assumptions.  >> derek, i want to come over  to you.  palantir was a black box, it  wasn't clear what they did.  now they expanded out to  commercial work.  we're talking about this  evaluation, and just the  potential they could have with  u.s. And global companies  looking to upgrade themselves  with ai.  do you believe the evaluation  is over stretched as well?  >> oh, well thank you for  having me.  we at krane shares, while the  current are optimistic.  palantir could become the gold  operating system for ai, we're  talking about potential  trillion dollar market.  now palantir is the key holding  in kraneshares.  infrastructure, and ai coin to  applications.  what is really exciting is how  the deployment is really taking  off in the enterprise world.  seeing real benefits.  better efficiency, and business  creating ai adoption, palantir  stands out in this space.  their ai platform, their system  is a game changer.  it brings together data, logic,  and action, in a way both  humans and ai can actually work  together.  but the ai platform is  topnotch.  security features, which is  crucial for companies to adopt  ai safely.  also palantir's business, the  trump administration is really  prioritizing efficiency and  digital transformation.  this could be a startup trend,  potentially bringing palantir  in the future.  >> maalik, back over to you.  evaluation, you're expecting  revenue growth and other things  to kind of meet that  evaluation.  do you agree with derek had to  say, this company has more  upside than we have seen last  year?  340% gain.  because derek seems to be  saying they have proprietary  software that other people  can't quite match.  >> first of all, i think i  agree with derek's point about  them having competitive  advantage.  when we look at our method, we  do, now as it relates to, as  you said, evaluations are  forward-looking, i would again  sort of put that question back,  what do you need to believe  about the top or the margin  profile for this business over  a five, ten-year time period  for you to get $70 or $80, as  it was illustrating a few days  ago, dollar per share  evaluation.  i tried to conduct a reverse  dcf, where you bake in what  assumptions would get you to  the stock price.  and the numbers i got would  have put palantir ahead of all  the software company asks out  there.  you have a ten-year around 30%.  you would have margin profile  gap, operating north f 55%.  if that is the assumption you  have over a ten-year period,  you could buy the stock at $80.  but when we're looking at our  own assumption, again, they are  very optimistic.  they factor ",

              "You and i used to talk  transports.  now you moved on to  industrials.  >> happy new year.  >> why don't we start with your  top pick.  parker, shares up 39% over the  last year.  why is this company your top  pick?  >> a high quality company.  50% revenues are exposed to  short cycle industrial  exposure.  30% of the business is  aerospace.  they have a balance sheet that  is prime to make further  acquisitions, about $12 billion  of capitol.  so, it gives us the balance of  secular growth via the  aerospace, and creative  acquisition, as well as  exposure to a short cycle  inflection, which we expect at  ubs over the next five, six  months.  we have to be patient about  that.  companiesstart reporting  results in january, we're not  going to be pointing to a  massive acceleration in short  cycle.  the leading indicators are  pointing in that direction,  whether it's small business  optimism.  so we're optimistic here that  if you had me back on in march  or april, we're talking about a  different tune.  >> all right, you just  mentioned manufacturing.  that has been lagging, we'll  say, i think there was one  month that was an outlier,  tipped over to expack.  mostly in contraction.  when do you see that turning  around and how important is  that to names?  are there other tail wednesdays  or manufacturing a key metric  to watch?  >> you're absolutely right.  the industrial economy has been  in resession, if you can  believe it or not, for the last  two plus years.  it's the longest stretch of  contraction.  you would expect that to  improve at some point.  interest rates matter.  there's an inverse  relationship.  the election is positive and  the psychology as you can see  in small business optimism.  so, it's a short cycle, low  visibility.  we'll see.  again, manufacturing is close  to 50.  it's been below 50 for two  years.  small business optimism saw a  surge from november to  december, and so we're quite  optimistic that over the next  couple months, the industrial  economy, as measured by the  manufacturing, will go from  contraction to growth.  the question is, what's the  magnitude of that improvement?  we'll see that over the course  of the next six months.  government policy has a lot to  do with that.  we are optimistic.  the other tail wednesday is ai  and data centers.  a lot of that infrastructure  that needs to be put up is  exposed to electric components.  that's another huge tail wind  for the industry.  >> we were talking about  quantum computing.  is there a tie-in with quantum  computing and industrials right  now?  >> there's a tie-in between ai  and industrials.  you can see with train  technologies.  there is an exposure, more  directly, i would call that  honey well, it's a 54% stake in  a private quantum computing  company.  we'll see what the evaluation  of that, the last evaluation  round was $2 billion.  there's about $4 per share of  value baked into honey well's  iyty equity value.  it needs massive amount of  infrastructure.  this is da",

              "Welcome back to squawk box.  welcome back to marcus.  we are looking at her chief  investment strategist.  good morning.  we have been wanting this  uniquely strange situation.  quantum computing in the  context of nvidia, and other  a.i.  darlings, and  the bitcoin risk  on or rest off ramp.  >> it has been a struggle.  it makes sense.  when you look at investor  positioning, they are at an  impasse.  you have the same percentage of  bulls versus bears.  there are two factors battling  it out right now.  on the one hand, you have a  positive story of artificial  intelligence that is carrying  itself into 2025.  yet the story of solid earnings  we expect for the quarter.  that has been taken into context of what we could get from the  fed and the new trump  administration.  that is creating some  volatility.  given that set up and the  markets have not removed enough  risk just yet, that is what we  had to go through.  let's go through this battle.  >> that is a euphemism for go  down?  >> that's right.  >> we have seen a bit of that  at the end of last year.  we saw the markets pulled back  2% or 3%.  we saw hedge funds at shorts.  we saw systematic investors  going through a wave of selling  and some private clients may  have done that as well.  i don't think we have seen  enough of that.  we are not at oversold levels.  we might have a share of new  one-month flows of the s&p that  is higher than normal, but i  don't think we have seen  enough.  i can say, this is the time to  jump into the market.  we have to be patient in  january and have the actors  battling out.  on the days we have policy  -induced uncertainty, like  yesterday, you look at the  things to buy.  maybe not quantum computers.  >> what do you looked buy?  to make the first big theme is  artificial intelligence.  it is carrying itself into 2025. The last 2 years have been  about semi conductors.  this year has to be about a.i.  software and modernization.  it also to be about a.i.  power.  is not just a number of  headlines talking about data  centers and how much they  consume.  and you need a times the  electricity to run and a.i.  center, it is a real trend.  the trump administration will  support this as well.  for that would be the additional investment in data centers.  outlook to a.i.  software and a.i.  power themes. Broadly, i would  look to alternatives.  one thing we talked about in  the outlook as if you expect  this to be the year of broader  outcomes and higher volatility  in the public markets, that's  why you may want to have that  he's in your portfolio of the  private markets where you have  typically higher risk adjusted  returns and less volatility  with more insulation.  >> is is the vintage?  are you going to look back, in  the alternative world where you  are playing private markets,  the reason there is a  volatility is because you don't  get to see the volatility.  for you to see the marks on a  quarterly basis.  it's for sure, but five to 7  years from now, do you look  back and say well, this was a  great time to get in?  >> i think that is one of those  years.  2021 was clearly not that here.  if you sent in a private equity  or venture capital, you did so  at high valuations.  we don't have that anymore.  were not at the same rock- bottom evaluations that we saw  in 2022 and 2023.  if you look at private equity,  they are trained below. It is a  decent point to step in.  for investors that have an  allocation for private equity  or they can purchase a second  during the middle-market buyout , with they can benefit from,  the pickup in activity that ",

              "Founder and managing director.  an investment consulting firm.  greg, good morning, always  great to see you.  >> good morning.  >> i want to start things off  with a sound bite last night  and see if you agree or  disagree.  >> we know the fed can't raise  rates.  that would make them look like  total idiots.  after we get a report and  interest rates go higher,  plenty of people say stocks got  ahead of themselves.  there are others who know only  one thing, if rates are going  higher, then we're headed for a  burst of inflation that will  send stocks lower.  >> so, greg, kramer's thesis,  higher bond yields.  it followed that read, agree  with that.  with yields the benchmark.  will that continue to put  pressure on equities?  >> i agray with that notion.  i disagree with the notion that  it is epistotic.  when we look at the inflation  read, frank, you will know,  many of us have been concerned  about what is just happening  organically.  we saw core go from 0 basis  points in june, 10 in july, 20  in august, followed by three 30  point reads and possibly a 40  point december.  both things oppose a head wind  for equities.  the organic rise of rates  fueled by deficit spending,  fueled by less of an appetite  in china, japan, potentially  others.  also, the reinsurgence, given  some of the administration  policy objectives and what that  may force the fed to do.  >> all right, part of that  thesis is investors are  counting on rate cuts going  forward.  i want to talk to you about the  fed.  this is an interesting idea  that you have here.  the feds on pace for a moment,  explain that.  your idea here is running  contrary to what kramer just  said.  what is this moment that you  think is coming up?  >> yeah, so, it harkins back to  1979 and '81.  they declared a premature  victory against inflation, and  had to come back in 1981 and  raise rates almost to 20%, far  higher than he had to do the  first time.  so while i don't want to  necessarily be alarmist and  ring the bell on something of  that nature, i do believe the  evidence is being put in that  we probably or most of us, some  of us did not.  most of us probably declared a  premature end to inflation, and  that battle was over.  the data, likely the jobs data,  the core cpi data over the last  five months, points to a  resurgence in inflation.  that is without the  inflationary platter of policy  that the administration  proposed.  >> first and foremost, thank  you.  made a little mistake on my  end.  that's a great reference, greg.  i want to get to the point of  your thesis.  you think the fed would raise  rates?  it might have been something  you said before that, but he  said the fed would lose their  credibility if they raise  rates.  do you see that as a real  possibility going forward?  >> i do see it as plausible.  this is not about a choice.  if any of us had a choice, we  would prefer for rates to stay  lower and we would prefer for  the cutting program to  continue.  i think if it is to become a  reality, the fed simply won't  have a choice.  we start to get into mass  deportation, trade wars and  tariffs, deficits, cuts on  taxes.  i think you're going to see a  very acute inflation and the  fed won't have a choice.  you have seen two governors  come out and say that they  decent from even last month's  cut.  so, you know, i think at the  very least, we're going to see  a pause.  i'm going to refrain from  saying it's likely that we see  a raise, because by the time  that becomes evident, it become  accepted that the feds have no  choice.  >> i want to ask you about a  red hot sector on the markets  over the last couple of months.  i know you're not a tech  analyst.  big upside moves when it comes  to stocks.  yesterday, comments from jen  son won, leading the whole  basket to decline double  digits.  when we see a hype cycle, what  does that do to market  sentiment?  what does that do to the market  action in your mind?  most people would afree, we're  around ai, quantum cop pouting  was supposed to be the next big  thing.  >> right.  i don't know if we're in a  height cycle, right?  because in terms of ai, we have  seen the companies putting up  the earnings growth.  we have seen the 50% earnings  growth.  while some look at the  multiples and say they are  stretched.  if you're going to give me 30%  earnings growth over the next  three years consistently, then  that's worth multiple.  so i think jenson's comments  had a natural impact in many  thought we would see the same  type of earnings s-curve within  the next five or six years and  that was worth waiting around  for.  is that worth waiting around  for if it's 20 years away?  probably not.  better places to deploy  capital.  so",

              "Believe it. But what we're interested in is  we want to help the industry get there as fast as possible.  >>> that was nvidia ceo jensen  huang with his outlook on the  quantum computing timeline. Shares of nvidia rebounding  slightly this morning after  sliding more than 6% yesterday. By the way, what he said about  quantum computing managed to  take out a lot of those quantum  computing stocks, some of the  smaller ones like ion q, quantum computing, rigetti. Joining us is joe moore. I want to get your take on this. I've been heading a lot of  stuff. I mean, after jensen huang made  his comments the night before  last we actually saw shares a  little higher in the morning. Maybe not by a lot, but it  certainly wasn't giving back the pullback we saw later in the  day. There were a lot of the tech  stocks and other big high flyers that pulled back, though, after  we got stronger than expected  jobs numbers, just in terms of  what the bls had in terms of  jobs openings, those jolts  numbers. That had people suspect that go  maybe the fed is going to be to  be more reluctant to cut rates  anytime soon and that caused all of these big high flyers to  pullback. Do you think the pullback in  nvidia shares yesterday was more related to what jensen huang did or didn't say or more related to the overall idea of watching the federal reserve and seeing how  the economy is doing? >> i mean, i think both of those play a role. Ces is a tradeshow around  consumer and automotive.  there is important information  i came out around those  markets.  this is 85% of the revenue.  the maven expectations of  people wanted to hear more  about that.  we have some of those issues.  overall, this is still a company in a strong product cycle.  data center was not the focus,  it is investor focused.  it is a combination of the  market issues that you talked  about as well as some  expectations around the  tradeshow.  there was nothing negative to  take away.  >> one of these in terms of the  data center that the street  would really like to hear?  another revenue is expected for  the year to come in at $113  billion, ramping up of north of  $200 billion for the fiscal  year that does end in january  2027.  what people want to hear?  >> expectations are high.  we are two months into the  blackwell cycle and the new  products they started shipping.  today we would get any color on  incremental blackwell products  was probably not going to  happen.  this was not the forum for that  anyway.  from a product standpoint, we  know everything that we need to  know.  from a revenue standpoint, you  are facing a bit of a  transition.  you have blackwell demand that  is very good.  you heard the comments from  jensen huang about the level of  blackwell demand being insane.  he did not repeat those  comments.  the issue you are dealing with  is blackwell demand is strong.  it is supply constrained.  hopper, the legacy product is  the largest portion of the data  center business.  they will have a couple of  quarters here where there is  meaningful upside.  the real upside is in the back  half of the year when you get  that full-blown blackwell ramp.  people would like to hear that.  i think they did hear that in  some sense.  they are trying to avoid the  really strong statements about  blackwell, because it is not  the main driver of the quarter.  that is the combination of  blackwell at hopper.  i am optimistic about how this  plays out.  i do see the upside being  stronger in the second half of  the year.  for with the stock that has  done so well, triple last year,  how much is priced in?  where are you telling people is  a price target were people  should feel comfortable?  to this is less about the  phenomenon that the stock has  been in more on valuing a  growth company on his growth  prospects.  the stock trades at 29 times  the estimate for 2026.  that would be high if there  were any deceleration of the  business.  i don't think there is, even  through the transitional  challenges.  administer the issues, you are  beating the numbers and they  are likely to move higher.  i still think the stock is  reasonably valued with good  growth prospects here an",

WE'RE TRYING TO RIGHT THE WRONGS OF THIS PRESIDENT AND MAKE SURE  THAT CFIUS IS ACTUALLY FOLLOWED. THE PROCESS HAS BEEN CORRUPT. YOU KNOW IT. I MEAN, LET'S FACE  IT. GOD KNOWS THAT THIS PROCESS HAS  BEEN TAINTED FROM THE VERY  BEGINNING AND WE NEED TO FIX IT. >> BURRITT'S POINT WAS THAT  PRESIDENT BIDEN IN BEING SO  OUTSPOKEN AGAINST THIS WAS  TELLING BASICALLY THE PEOPLE ON  CFIUS TO VOTE AGAINST IT BEFORE  THEY EVEN SAW ANY OF THIS. BURRITT WENT ON TO CALL FOR  PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP TO TAKE A  FRESH LOOK AT THE DEAL. IT WAS POINTED OUT TO HIM  REPEATEDLY THAT INCOMING  PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS NOT IN FAVOR OF THIS DEAL, EITHER, AND  CAMPAIGNED ON THAT PRETTY  HEAVILY, BUT HE SAID -- I THINK  SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES -- I  WAS LISTENING TO THE  INTERVIEW -- HE SAID SOMETHING  ALONG THE LINES OF PRESIDENT  TRUMP IS A VERY SMART MAN, I  THINK I CAN APPEAL TO HIM TO  MAKE THIS REALIZE THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. HE WOULD LIKE TO TALK WITH HIM  AND TALK THAT THROUGH. LATER IN THE DAY ON \"MAD MONEY\"  THE CEO OF CLEVELAND-CLIFFS  FIRED BACK. CLEVELAND-CLIFFS WAS A RIVAL  BIDDER FOR U.S. STEEL AND  REPEATEDLY CAST DOUBT ON THE  DEAL'S PROSPECTS TO INVESTORS. LISTEN IN. >> THE STATEMENTS COMING FROM  THE CEO OF U.S. STEEL CALLED THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  CORRUPT. AS AN AMERICAN I FEEL OFFENDED. THIS IS JUST ABSURD. >> BY THE WAY, THE U.S. STEEL  CEO BURRITT HAD ALSO CLAIMED  THAT CLEVELAND-CLIFFS WAS BEHIND SOME OF THIS, TOO, AND THAT  THEY'VE BEEN GOING AFTER THEM  FOR THE ISSUES ON THIS, TOO. SHARES OF U.S. STEEL ARE DOWN  ABOUT 15% SINCE THE DEAL WAS  FIRST ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER OF  2023. OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF QUESTIONS  STILL TO PLAY OUT IF THERE WOULD BE A REVIEW OF THE CFIUS  VERSION -- VISION ON THIS,  WHETHER INCOMING PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD CHANGE HIS MIND ON ANY OF  THESE THINGS, WHETHER THERE  WOULD BE ANOTHER BID FROM  CLEVELAND-CLIFFS, IF NOT, AND  WHETHER U.S. STEEL WOULD  CONSIDER ANY OF THES",
