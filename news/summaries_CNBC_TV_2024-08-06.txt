Title: Crypto market selloff first major market test for new spot crypto ETFs
Transcript:
cnbc.com's mackenzie sigalos is  joining me. >> frank, mega cap coins are  coming back, but monday, we saw  connection in the market. $370 billion wiped off the  market cap of all digital tokens in 24 hours. bitcoin plummeting to $49,000. ether reported the biggest  single day drop in years. much of this was the knock-on  effect from the broader selloff. what is different this time is a broader base of investors are  caught in the crossfire with the spot etfs. for the first time, we got a  litmus test to see if the crypto investors who got exposure to  bitcoin and ether through the  first time through the funds  would flee the asset all  together or see it as an  opportunity to buy the dip. frank, i was looking at net flow data and it seems like they  stayed in the game. across all spot coin etfs, there were $168 million of outflows,  but the fund did not see any  redemptions at blackrock. that is a fraction of the $50  billion market cap of the funds. with the spot ether etfs, we saw $48 million added. these are not block row funds,  but investors did not freak out. >> that's with bitcoin below  50,000 yesterday. it is 55,000 right now. i know you did a lot of  reporting yesterday. something else you are  following. morgan stanley is the first of  the financial advisors to say  they will add bitcoin to  portfolio allocations. i have to ask what this could  mean for crypto? >> this could be a game changer. we are talking the first of the  major wall street players to  take this step. up until this point, financial  advisers were barred from  recommending this to clients  while they did due dildiligence. starting tomorrow, morgan  stanley will be able to  recommend bitcoin to clients. this is what the crypto market  has been waiting for.  >> you are obviously excited  about it. it will generate more stories. i know you have done a lot of  reporting on. this what about the other banks? schwab and td ameritrade? >> this will force the move of  others who have been sitting on  the sidelines since the product  launch in january. this could be a great thing for  the price of bitcoin. this market run unlike past  cycles we have seen in the  crypto mar

Title: Waddell: Rotation trade should continue following recent sell-off
Transcript:
from waddell associates. good morning. >> good morning, frank. >> you saw the odds. increasing thought of the  50-basis point cut. i want to ask you. you are somebody who manages  money. do they need the 50-basis point  cut or is the 25-point cut good  enough? >> we're conflating issues here. the u.s. has gone through a  growth scare and that's okay. that's what the fed wanted. the 114,000 jobs is still  consistent with sort of stable  unemployment levels, although  the unemployment rose because  more people entered the work  force. i was concerned when services  ism slipped negative in july --  june and came back positive in  july. i think the economy is fine. the fed is at 5.5%. they need to be at 3% fand if i  is a normal economy, it is 3%. that's why they are aggressively pricing in because there is no  need to be restrictive anymore  as a couple of fed heads said  yes. the reason i'm conflating issues is the fed issues is one thing  and what is going in the market  is a currency issue. because we spend time talking  about stocks and bonds, we don't often talk about currencies. the fall apart yesterday was  forced liquidation. it happened because back on july 10th, the mag seven stocks  topped and the yen bottomed. since then, the yen has gone up  14% and the mag seven stocks  have gone down 18%. people that were short the yen  and long the mag seven are 30%  upside down before applying  leverage. somebody got taken out on a  gurney yesterday. that's what really moved the  markets around. >> david, you are referring to  the carry trade. the yen carry trade.  >> oh, yeah. it has been going on for a  month.  >> we have done a lot of talk on the network. i want to get more focus on the  markets. you want to talk about currency, but let's talk about stocks. stifel out with a note and they  believe the s&p will correct to  5,000 in october. they believe there is a risk of  the bear market if the slowdown  becomes a recession. do you agree or disagree? do you think right now is a good time for portfolio protection  and if so, what would you do? >> seasonally we're in a weak  period. in an election year, the markets have 14% correction. they go up 26% over the next  year. to me, this is a window of  opportunity for investors to get in. if traders are batting this  market around and when you have  a big move, everybody comes out  and comes out with bearish  notes. think the economy slows, not  recesses. i think the fed is forward  looking. i think he will cut  conversationally at jackson  hole. for us, we're buying into this  at dollar cost averaging into  halloween. >> where? it is easy to say buy the dip. where do you put money right  now? >> we went from the mag seven  trade to the rotation trade to  recession trad

Title: Mizuho: Utilities have a great growth story, should outperform
Transcript:
best. anthony from mizuho. >> good morning, frank. >> we are highlighting that  recent relative out performance  by utilities in the last week. i want to ask is that a flight  to safety that utility stocks  will weather this storm or a  function of bond yields  decl declining? >> you know, we're going to give you both with the a.i. as you  mentioned before. the a.i. back drop and utility  stocks never looked better. growing 6% to 7%. we have demand of the product  electricity. that's one of the positive  sides. also what is attractive is d dividends have never been safer. utilities have cleaned up their  businesses. things are looking good on both  ends there. >> all right. you gave us utility playbook. attractive low growth and  balanced regulations. what is low growth? how does an investor look at low growth? >> you look at low growth as we  sell more units than they  thought we would sell in the  rate plan. we decide how many units will  sell. if we sell 1 million units,  everything is good and expenses  are balanced with that sell. now the load is growing and it  does 1 million units and now it  sells 1 million and ten units. that provides the cover on  rising the expense for  utilities. when you have a utility with  positive low growth, that  provides sustainability with  rate filings. you can deliver on your 5% or 6% or 6% to 8% earnings growth. this is something we have been  looking for for years. we finally have it. we have seen sustainable low  growth hasn't been seen since  2007 or 2008 and now the  beautiful a.i. demand story. >> looking at data from the iea. if you look at a google search,  it takes .3 watt hours and a  chatgpt search takes 2.9 watt  hours. we need more energy and does  this mean utilities have more  upside? >> i think the whole sector has  a lot more upside. we're very conservative sector. we are giving you 6% to 7%  earnings growth. that growth is not baked into  the additional a.i. demand you  displayed on the screen. we're going to give you in line  s&p type growth trading at  discount and 200-basis point  better yield in this  environment. that a

cnbc financial council. lee, good to see you.  >> good morning, frank. good to see you as well.  >> the place i would like to  start, lee, if you wouldn't  mind, tech. tech hit the high in july. a lot of people put a lot of  their money in mega cap tech  this year. if you are a big tech investor,  what do you do now? >> it depends on whether or not  you're overweight. a lot of our clients are  invested in funds. if you are invested, you are  invested in the big tech. do you have additional holdings  in apple or microsoft and  nvidia? if you are in a position where  you can take on a little bit of  additional risk in spite of what happened yesterday and you  thought it made sense to focus  on tech, now might be a time to  take a look at nvidia. it got beat up badly about 6%. if you look at the last month,  it is a good opportunity as long as you think it is a long-term  position.  >> you think this is a buying  opportunity.  >> absolutely.  >> i want to bounce something  off you. a note from stifel yesterday. they are looking to correct by  october down 12% from the july  peak from the slowing u.s.  economy with sticky inflation. they also say there is risk of a bear market if the slowdown  becomes a recession. we are seeing more bearish  calls. with that in mind, what do do  you? when you talk to your clients,  they just want to be safe. what do you do? >> absolutely. a lot of our clients want to be  safe. we begun to use more and more  products where you are down size protected, but still participate in the upside of the market. my base case is not seeing a  recession any time soon. are things slowing down? yes. that's what we are all cheering  for. we want things to slow down so  the fed would get to a point  where they are comfortable  cutting rates. i think that is still likely. we will see the 25-basis point  cut in the markets. we are not seeing broad job  destruction in the economy. things are softening, but we  just haven't seen that broad job destruction. still looking for a soft  landing.  >> with the fed cut coming up,  are you telling clients to take  money out? >> not particular sectors we're  saying to get out of. if we looked at things and say  you're in a more

Title: What Caterpillar earnings may signal about the broader economy
Transcript:
crfa. jon jonathan, great to have you  here.  >> good morning, frank.  >> your price ctarget of $345. that provides a 2% upside from  here. what are you expecting from this result? >> we had a buy rating for  caterpillar for some time, but  after seeing a 60% rise from the lows late in 2023, we actually  downgraded to a hold back in  april. as you said, it has been down  roughly 16% or so. i think q2, we are expecting  sales guidance to come down. if you look at a few  macroeconomics headwinds and  macro pmi has been down. the last 21 months with one  month expansion here which is  note able. we have construction spending  which is stagnating with the  higher interest rate  environment. if we look at the direct peers  like cmh and volvo group, they  revised sales targets down. we think sales expectations are  going to be hmoderated with the  pusho out of interest rate cuts. >> john, you just said the  expectations for interest rate  cuts have been pushed out. we hear people will see a  50-basis point cut in september. u.s. non residential  construction which is 75% of  caterpillar business, wouldn't a 50-point cut or 25-point cut be  a tailwind for the business? >> absolutely. i'm talking in regards to when  we entered the year. we view that original guidance  for 2024 sales to be in line  with 2023 is assuming there  would be a cut sooner than what  we were expecting here in  september. given that july we didn't see  that happen, you know, we think  that is translating to business  investment and capital goods  pushed out further. >> the u.s. is a big part of the business, but what about china? china is 5% to 10% of revenue. we have seen a lot of companies  with weakness in china. also, competition from consumer  brands. does caterpillar face domestic  competition in china ? >> china is a cheap market so  far. given what we see in peers and  other industrial conglomerates  facing china headwinds, it is  weaker. this could be additional  headwind to crimp sales  expectations. we do think it's not a factor  that is a net negative for  caterpillar.  >> what about the read on the  broader economy? what should we look for in the  report to give us a read on the  u.s. economy and the global  economy? >> as far as caterpillar being a leading economic indicator of  sorts, we don't see much value  there. there are other companies that  have given that insight as far  as what's going on. we think as a lagging indicator, it could be a lot of value and  confirming is construction  slowing as much as we have seen  from peers or is it more  idiosyncratic challenges with  those companies? caterpillar can highlight to  what degree we are seeing a  construction downturn. additionally, manufacturing  rights. energy and transportation  business is tied to industrial  activity. once again, we c

Title: Smith: Tech has minimal upside compared to other sectors
Transcript:
from wells fargo advisors. mark, great to have you here.  >> good morning, frank.  >> let's start off with today. futures are well off the highs. what is your "wex" word of the  day? >> this is a great opportunity  for folks to take stock of  what's going on in their  portfolio. a lot of folks have been riding  high on tech and pretty happy  about it. i would say this is a great  opportunity to rebalanceyour  portfolio. if youyou have investments up 1, and you did not know to sell or  hold, this should wake you up  and take your winners off the  table, not all of them, and  diversify aside from high flying tech.  >> you are looking beyond high  flying tech. i have to talk to you about high flying tech. looking at tech, it has moved in correction territory from the  high on july 10th. if you are looking at tech or  holding tech or looking to buy  into tech, what would you do? would you buy the dip? would you wait? is there more pain ahead? how are you viewing that? >> i think given the run-up over the last two years, you really  have to take stock in that and a lot of companies have valuations that are far exceeding what  their forecasts are for next  year. you have to look at sectors with more upside. for me, tech is not one of those sectors. you had a.i. be the theme of the year and now you are starting to see are these companies going to perform based on their  valuations. a lot of them are astronomical. for me, i'm a value investor. you have to look for the value. tech is not where it is right  now. there are a number of sectors. the number one sector i'm  looking at right now that i  like, because i don't have a  crystal ball, is the financials. you have seen chairman powell  has said and he has given  everyone some clues that the fed seriously is starting to cut  rates. who cares if it is 25 or 50. we may be done with the  tightening cycle.  >> mark, i want to get to your  pick which is municipal bonds. quickly, why municipal bonds? >> if this market continues,  there will be a flight to  quality. munis is a safety. you are seeing the presidential  election in november is  happening. if the democrats w

Title: Don't see AI having a big impact on Apple this year or next, says LightShed Partners' Walter Piecyk
Transcript:
ceo dara khosrowshahi that is  going to happen in 15 minutes  from now.  >>> apple shares ticking higher. this after a double-digit  decline yesterday. joining us is walter piecyk. mr. apple, he knows everything  apple. i'm curious what you first  thought when you saw what warren buffer fete did over the  weekend.  >> when anyone who is well-known or other portfolio managers, the stocks tend to overreact. sometimes these guys who have  been extremely successful do get things wrong from time to time. but then when, you know, the  stock started selling off and  then you had the news of the  lawsuit with google, then you  just say, well, the guy remains  kind of on top in calling  things, you know, at the right  time, i guess. we'll see the next couple of  months and how they play out.  >> okay, so let's move to google and then i want to move to the  stock itself. but the google decision  yesterday, you think portends  what for apple insofar as apple  pays an enormous or i should say google pays an enormous fee to  apple every year to be the  default search engine.  >> at least 20 billion. who knows what the growth rate  is in the services sector and  had good guidance for that  segment this quarter. i don't know what the costs are  associated when google pays you  $20 billion to be the default  search engine. there can't be many costs other  than someone collecting the  wire, so, you know in terms of  profitability, doing 100 billion in net income and have a 16% tax rate, that's a pretty big chunk  but you know stuff like this  takes years to kind of hash out, google is obviously going to  fight it. you know, it's going to go to  the next layer here in terms of  what is the exact remedy in  dealing with this and then  there's going to be challenges  on that, so it'll take a while  but you can't ignore it. it's a meaningful thing. i heard you guys talking earlier about the politics of it but, i  mean, i think j.d. vance has  talked pretty aglgressively in  terms of his views so politics i think can play some role over  time, but, you know, it kind of  feels like it's inevitable that  something is going to happen to  threaten this $20 billion  services revenue thumb for  apple.  >> let's flip the board around. what do you think the fair value of this company is at this point of the ball game? >> i mean, i thought it was  lower a couple of weeks ago. the services guidance which  really wasn't talked about on  the earnings call, i mean,  they're talking about  maintaining 14% growth there for a very big business. it's a $100 billion line item. what it doesis help the overall company grow now at 5%. i mean, if you look at 5  percentage points service is now 3.5 of those 5 percentage points of growth. if you have 5% growth for a  company that's perceived as low  risk and provides incremental  upside then you can maybe  justify at least the 3% free  cash flow yield, the 31 earnings multiple so i kind of -- i feel  like we're there in terms of the full value. where i could be wrong is if ai  turns out to, in fact, drive, i  think you had a guest on  yesterday who said the biggest  super cycle which seems to be  set every year and that could  give you additional upside. go ahead.  >> that was my question. do you believe that we are about to go through a super cycle  based on ai and apple  intelligence in the phones come  this fall? we discussed yesterday the  rollout of that ai even the  product in the software isn't  going to come necessarily all at one time when the new phone  rolls out itself. >> well, that's the new  narrative, andrew. it was supposed to happen this  year, then it will be next year. feels like it's always next year in terms of the impact to the  replacement cycle. the operators are still in this  country at least sell most of  the phones to the end consumer. there's no sign that this is  impacting the replacement cycle. i signed up as a developer. the latest development or latest release of ios 18 and have been  using the intelligent series,  not that much better, the photos are not that up better. there's a lot of work that will  be done between now and when  this is formally released. i just don't see it for this  year and even for next year  having some big impact in terms  of creating this megacycle. what the narrative, though, is  going to be, well, and, you  know, lightshed we're huge  believers in the potential and  the promise of ai, so apple is  in a very unique position to be  a primary beneficiary so it's  accurate to say this could take  a couple of years. it's always going to be the  excuse. if earnings don't deliver it's  next quarter, next year, still  the guys there for ai and that  is something that helps to  sustain the valuation, you'll  always have those believers for  good reason, they've established

Title: Don't think the Fed should move in September, says Komal Sri-Kumar
Transcript:
last year. let's get back to the markets. joining must is sri kumar. good to have you this morning,  sri, given everything's that's  happened.  >> thank you for having me.  >> what would you say with the  carry trade and japan going up? the fed likely not moving. do you think they should have? >> no, i don't think the fed  should have moved in july and i  don't think the fed should move  in september. i think what happened over the  past week with the developments  in japan and the first rate  increase in quite a long time,  japanese interest rates have  been too low and the japanese  are the creditors to the rest of the world. when the interest rate went up,  it made it more attractive for  the japanese to take the money  back. global investors, in turn, sold  when the yen appreciate yd on t  higher interest rates. that's in japan. coming over to the united  states, i think it carried over  to here because of the  expectation of high valuations  in tech caused the tech drop  yesterday. then you had the overall market  taking flight over the  possibility of the recession. now, the other thing to touch  upon, joe, is what is happening  on the recession side. an important development  yesterday, momentarily, it  happened for a few seconds, is  the 2-10 yield curve came  positive after being inverted  for two long years. what it says to me is, yes, the  risk of recession has increased  and that is what is also showing up in the market correction last week. the fed should not have acted,  joe, because yoi don't think th  fed should act in response. the mandate --  >> the market moves because of  the jobs number. >> the market moves because of  the jobs number. what was wrong with the jobs  number? healthy. 4.3% unemployment rate. not very high. wages are still rising  significantly. inflation above the fed target. the fed has two mandates. keep up economic growth and  bring down the inflation rate. both of them are in the process  of happening. why do you need to change? >> because at this point, we're  at 114,000 and suddenly all of  the companies that were hiring  look around and say it's always  a loss of confidence. it is always something  psychological. if they decide there may be a  slowdown coming, i'm definitely  not going to hire now and it  becomes self fulfilling. the next job number could be  under 100,000. who knows at this point? you see a lot of companies  pulling their horns from hiring  quickly. >> that is definitely a  possibility. let's go back to looking at the  numbers and what it may signal. we had 114,000 or 115,000 jobs a few months ago. then it picked up and went up  again closer to the 200,000  number.  >> we don't know if that will  happen again.  >> that may help again.  >> or it may not.  >> or it may not. the thing is why do you need to  move before? that shows a panicking fed. what will they do? increase interest rates again? >> i don't know. if they are now and if they  stayed too long, as a lot of  people said it. jeremy said they need to get  back to where they should be. you think that's definitely not  the case? >> i strongly disagree with the  jeremy siegel position. the problem today started in  2020 and 2021. easing monetary policy  accompanying the fiscal policy,  both coincided and chairman  powell telling us he is not  concerned about the fiscal  policy stance. he will do what he will do on  the monetary side. my economic theory education  suggests that makes no sense at  all. once you have done it, and you  will cut interest rates to zero, and you are going to double the  balance sheet from the level,  which is what the fed did, you  will have inflation.  >> so, did they stay at zero too long and are they making the  same mistake staying restrictive too long? >> once you stay too long, you  make a series of mistakes. >> the die was cast. >> no perfect outcome. what i would suggest is  hereafter, i suggest have a  rules-based policy. data dependence makes no sense  to me. >> that's the last thing you  have. >> you lose flexibility. >> i want you to lose  flexibility. >> i understand you do. what happens in a true crisis? >> in a true crisis, you have -- if you not a taylor rule, you  are looking at what is happening to employment and inflation and  based on that, you move interest rates. so, it is responsive to economic conditions. however, you do not move to  every single number to  employment and inflation. the problem with being data  dependence is the long lag that  many of these effects have and  you are not able to adjust to  it. andrew, that's the basic problem with what we have. i call it forward confusion. ben bernancke said forward  guidance gives you a better  guidance to where the market is  going and adjust. if you have wrong guidanceit  is the opposite.  >> you don't want -- you can  make the case that -- who  doesn't want a rules-based  system? i know judy shelton wants it and it drives liberals crazy. john taylor. you can just explain it to me? there are people even here, it  drives them nuts.  >> i have a solution. andrew may have one as well. let me tell you what it is that  is wrong with rules based  policy. none of you need to come to work every day. you can stay home. the computer will do your job  because you have all of the  information.  >> a seat of the pants approach. it depends on 

Title: DCLA's Sarat Sethi on market sell-off: Find high-quality companies if you're a long-term investor
Transcript:
it was much higher. these were all much- higher  earlier in the pre-market  session. joining us now with more on the  markets is serat sethi. serat, with your style of  investing, you are looking for  places to stay invested to  weather whatever storm is on the horizon. we don't know if it is a  category one or category two. you are somewhat insulated from  the macro.  >> i do, joe, you don't know if  you are in the front end of  something or a short-term blip. we know the carry trade has  unintended consequences. does that mean we will get  another tornado? we don't know. we have the momentum investors  saying let's watch it. there are really good companies  that got sold off that had  nothing to do with the market  being overvalued or an a.i.  bubble. if you are a long-term investor, find the high quality investors  and then look at the companies  you could not buy before because of the valuations happen. joe, you and an i talked about  this in the past. if the fed is going to cut  rates, you can't hide in bonds. why not own really good  companies that have cash flow  and dividends that grow faster  than inflation. i do think you will find  opportunities as i call them  fallen angels. if you are a long-term investor  and over the years, you made  money through this. it hasn't been over the last  five or seven years. it has been proven over a long  time.  >> we were trying to figure out  a technical thing and people do  the carry trade and they loved  doing that and it gets unwound. what causes it? what is the actual cause of what happened? that's what i'm interested in. we stayed at zero for a long  time, sarat. we talked about what the  long-term consequences of  pricing assets below where cash  doesn't cost as much should  because you get investment and  all these things happen. then the fed feels the need to  harness the inflation it  engendered and they're  restrictive. >> right.  >> we need to know right now. maybe they were much more  restrictive than we knew at the  time. maybe inflation was supply side  or pandemic related and maybe  they killed the goose that laid  the golden egg. maybe it's already too late. is that not possible? >> that definitely could be  possible, but i do think you  have a fed that is very aware of inflation at this point and  looking at price stability and  what happened in japan. that is a function of a lot of  leverage and latsrates being lo. the interesting thing is we cut  rates which hurts japan. it is momentum cta as well. at the end of the day, if the  fed is one step behind and they  start cutting rates, you can  actually get better price  momentum here because certain  stocks will do well, especially  if interest rates go down, then  the cost of borrowing comes  downs and consumers feel better. maybe the bad data comes ands  these are the options we get. the corrections as we go into  60% of earnings right now. i do think there will be  quality. joe, what are you going to do? are you going to start buying  bonds at this point? they will start maturing and  rates will come down already. you have good opportunities to  grow your capital.  >> i could see a couple of  different scenarios. i could see where this is a  blip. the markets have run up so much, they were obviously look for a  reason to give back a little of  the incredible two-year gains  that we have seen, especially in the s&p. i can see it the other way,  sarat. this is yesterday being a  pre-shock of something. it causes the fed to do that  interim 50 pointer within the  next month. that's possible, right? >> completely. >> if this gets out of hand and  we're in that period where  october's coming -- if we got  another couple days like  yesterday, the fed might think  we stayed too long. too high too long. >> yeah. the offset of that is you have  people more nervous saying what  did the fed miss. that's the reason you see it. no matter now, what is the fed  seeing that we're not seeing? i would say this and you know me long enough. i always say this. if you are outside your comfort  zone, don't chase the market. if you are going to rebalance  now or have extra capital you  have been waiting for -- you  know, i have extra capital. don't chasethe market. this could be the time to put  the money to work. you will get better  opportunities in certain stocks  or sectors. don't chase it if you are  outside your comfort szone. this could be a step down. we could be in a growth blip and buy when the market comes down. and the other thing is, some of  these stocks have gone up so  much, just rebalance some

box." uber out with its second quarter results beating on both the top  and bottom lines. uber coming in above mobility  estimates but a little bit shy  of expectations on delivery as  then i want to talk about the  guidance and joining us is dara  khosrowshahi. how are you? >> great to be here, thanks.  >> we've been watching the  markets, obviously, but a lot of questions about the consumer,  about growth in this country,  you are perhaps one of the  better barometers of all of this so let's talk about this past  quarter but let's also talk  about where you think things are headed.  >> well, andrew, i think our  results that were incredibly  strong speak for themselves and  had greece bookings of $40  billion up 21% to year on year  which is very similar to what we had last quarter. chips growing 21% as well,  ebitda of $5.7 billion up over  70% on a year over year basis  and translated into free cash  flow of $1.7 billion so the  company is really hitting on all cylinders and what we see for  the consumer is the consumer  remains strong, especially in  terms of their demand for our  services. past the pandemic the consumer  spend continues to be growing in higher rates than consumers  spend on retail, and that's  absolutely showing in uber in  terms of our performance now and our performance going forward  and we've also looked at, you  know, different income cohorts  of consumers as well, for  example, lower income cohorts of consumers are actually growing  their spend faster on our  marketplace than higher income  cohorts, as well. even when we dig to see are  there early signs of weakness,  we don't see any as of now  although we're always on our  toes.  >> do you think of yourself as a barometer of what's happening in this country and the globe or do you think that you're living on  an island and it's an  idiosyncratic island and we  shouldn't take too much away  from it except to say that it's  working for uber? >> well, with 30 million trips a day it's a pretty big island,  but i would say that we've  consistently proven that we can  grow faster than the category so i think that's something to take into account. we're the largest player. we have the best technical  capabilities and will do better  than the overall marketplace and think there are certain elements of uber that are  countercyclical. we get more drivers on the  platinumf -- platform. they earn $17.9 billion up over  20% on a year-over-year base and eta has come down, prices come  down and merchants for eats are  offering 70% more in terms of  merchant funded offer so we're a channel that can push demand  when business is needed or  individuals like our drivers  need to make some extra cash. >> tell us what's going on on  the each fund. one of the things that people  complain about and don't  complain about just uber or  door -- how expensive getting  food delivered to you,  especially if you're a single  person or even a two-person  couple. makes a lot of sense to get food brought to you maybe when you  have four or five people but  given all of the additional  fees, i would have thought that  would be one of the first places when you thought the economy  would be challenged that you'd  start to see it.  >> andrew, delivery has been a  habit that turned out to be much more sticky whether you're  ordering for yourself or  ordering for a family. but we are very much investing  in lowering prices. our membership, for example,  uber one membership which gets  you no delivery fees for  delivery for uber eats, gets you cash back on mobility, those  member ranks are at an all-time  high, over 50% of volumes on  delivery come from members and  don't pay any delivery fees and  we continue to increase that  percentage. at the same time we're  encouraging restaurants to offer more deals on uber eats, as well and bringing uber one to  students for just $4.99 a month  they can become members and  hopefully when they grow up and  become professionals they can  continue the uber habit going  forward so we do continue to  invest in affordability and  showing up in volumes, volumes  in uber eats are up 17% similar  to last quarter and we're  gaining category position in  every single one of our top ten  markets on a year on year basis. >> fate has been somewhat  challenged. what's going on there? >> yeah, freight has been  challenged by the same weakness  you see in retail to some extent coming out of the pandemic. the hangover is not over. the freight train continues to  execute really well in a very,  very difficult market, the fact  is right now, post-covid, a lot  of truckers came into the  marketplace, marketplace prices  came down and those marketplace  prices have not adjusted yet. we're watching carefully but in  the meantime, our team continues to bring technology to  essentially connect shippers  with truckers on a direct basis  kind of

recent market volatility let's  welcome jay clayton, now a cnbc  contributor. where do you want to start? when you come in, we always  have, like, a kind of a buffet  of things. i don't know if there is a  sneeze tray. i don't buffets without sneeze  trays or sneeze shield.  >> fair enough.  >> the last three days, what  have you said, oh, my god, i  need to talk about with this joe and andrew? anything? >> market function yesterday. >> it wasn't great, was it? >> i think it worked. given that you had clearly a ton of forced selling, people were  selling because --  >> margin calls.  >> because they had margin calls and had to fund things and with  that globally, the market  functioned well. i think that that is -- that is  good news. what else is good news? our g-sibs. what we worried about, clearly  this was nothing to them. they can handle market  volatility like this. you know, you talk to, you know, the largest banks, this was not  a problem for them. you know, so those are very good things. one thing that we're hearing  this morning, hearing on this  program is the fed, you know,  people are saying what should  the fed be doing? my takeaway is, thank goodness  we have an independent fed,  right? you have all of these different  pushes and pulls and the like  and in a political season whe'r  less than 100 days away from an  election --  >> why even the possibility of  it not being independent and we  were just talking about that,  why not have a rules-based fed  instead of someone who could be  swayed, someone who flies by the seat of the pants. someone thinks greenspan was  this, janet yellen was this,  bernanke was this. we wouldn't -- it wouldn't have  to be dependent on one person  leading 12 others around. >> i don't think it's one  person. i think jay powell, chair  powell --  >> it's a consensus.  >> -- does a pretty good job. maybe they follow along because  they find a pretty good spot. why not have a rule? >> yeah.  >> because the world changes. the financial world is complex. why have a rule when you have  disciplined fiscal spending as  opposed to --  >> they stayed at zero and  completely enabled the fiscal  spending.  >> but now they've responded.  >> and we're in the middle of  responding and we don't know  how --  >> i'm going to defend the fed  here. we're all looking to the fed to  deal with this situation with  the very blunt tool of interest  rates when we have, you know,  unprecedented fiscal spending,  right? we have unprecedented supply  shots. we have volatility around the  world. we have europe, which is --  >> you think we would have  unprecedented fiscal spending -- their place is whatever -- they  shouldn't try to cut off the  spigot.  >> i think, unfortunately, you  know, they're in reactionary  mode as it goes to fiscal s
z spending.  >> can we -- let's talk about -- we can talk about google. my point was, it's just weird  and i don't know, we're finding  out who appointed the judge. i'm not going to say one way or  the other that's political, but  it's one person that's deciding  on -- i don't know -- but then  there's also --  >> you go to the appeals court.  >> what about this? you think google is really good  at what it does.  >> i'll start with that. when it's not -- when it's not  the browser that comes up, i  switch to it because my  experience is it's just better,  so, okay, and that's something  that the judge has to deal with. the fact that consumers may just like this. what i thought -- i thought was  good about the opinion, i  perused it quickly, the judge  did explain the thinking.  >> right.  >> in a pretty clear way. i think in these types of  situations what does the judge  owe the parties and what do they owe the appellate court.  >> as much of a balanced view so the public can react, the  appellate court can look at it.  >> is it a good or bad precedent for our tech industry which is  the best in the world? >> i am all in on tech. i'm all in on tech. all in on america. one of our greatest advantages  and have to be careful.  >> light touch.  >> here's my question, my  question is are they fighting  yesterday's war, which is to say that google has been the freedom annapolis, you know, search  engine in the world but now  we're talking about  perplexability and openai and  alwa  all of a sudden microsoft is  making a new run at making bing, you know, a meaningful player. i don't know if any of them will succeed but if you look over 10, 20, 30 years at the top ten  companies in america, in terms  of market cap and revenue, they  do switch.  >> they switch.  >> they switch and that's  something to be said about  competition. >> innovation is a much better  response than the government to  these types of situations.  >> still having said that --  >> it's absolutely clear.  >> having said that, look --  >> and people would argue, oh,  but the government needs to be  there to foster innovation. back to joe's point, light  touch, forward looking? >> the complicated part. if i'm apple i say to myself i  should be able to sell parts of  my screen to whoever i want.  >> 100%.  >> okay. in this case they sell it to  google. because they sold it to google,  google has an because they sold  for a lot of money, by the way,  not everybody has -- can afford  the screen space, if you will,  so the capital, if you will, all of a sudden has competitive  value.  >> yeah.  >> so they get on this screen  and there's a feedback loop and  that's the part that i think we  haven't thought through from a  competitive perspective.  >> i don't think this is that  new. what brand does macy's put in  the storefront window? >> absolutely. no, no, but here's the question. what product do you know that  gets put in the macy's window  and the product gets better  because it's in the window, so  the reason that the google --  >> i know the network effects.  >> because more people are using it and, therefore, it can train  effectively better to actually  send people to the right place  in a way, frankly, that some of  these others can't.  >> so --  >> that's interesting? >> is apple supposed to say, i'm sorry, i can't put you on  because it's too good a deal? >> i've always defended apple's  right to do that but then the  question is does google not have the right to pay the money? it's a very interesting sort of  philosophical but now it's a  very practical issue. if you're into antitrust, this  one actually is closer to me in  terms of, like, thinking through the sort of unique dynamics at  play than some of the others.  >> i get it because -- and when  you are in a government position like that, hig

Title: The underlying fundamentals of the economy are sound, says Neuberger Berman's Joe Amato
Transcript:
today's opening bell and joining us is joe amato, chief investor  at newberger investment group. what did you think of yesterday. >> i thought it would be a  run-of-the-mill tuesday and talk about the olympics on a quiet  summer morning and quite a  market over the last couple of  days and clearly violent unwind  of a lot of positioning over the course of the last couple of  days. we still think the underlying  fundamentals of economy are  sound, although signs of  weakening clearly so i think  you're going to continue to see  a bit of chop as this unwind  continues. it doesn't unwind in a day,  right? it takes a bit of time.  >> we've been talking about what that looks like. some happening in japan. that seems to be a huge  component and part of this. are you thinking to yourself  when clients call as i'm sure  they did yesterday either should i be selling or more importantly i have cash on the sideline. should we be buying? you're telling them what.  >> i think your point on cash is important. we think that the fed's going to move rapidly over the course of  the next six months or so. the market is pricing in,  roughly, what, 120 or so basis  points of reduction in the fed  fund rate so those earning 5% in cash will start to earn a lot  less than that, so starting to  put money to work as you see  this rate cut cycle begin. you see inflation coming down. it may not necessarily get to  the target level but clearly  it's come down so i think you  want to start to put money to  work. >> we keep talking about august  and what it portends for  october, they're super anxious. >> a long way off.  >> if you think there will be  chop between now and then, some  might sit on their hands.  >> i think you take advantage of these opportunities that get  presented to you, so if you  think about japan, we've been  bullish on japan. when you see that kind of  decline, granted it was up 10%  overnight but think yap is a  long-term attractive market. there's a lot of important  secular changes going on in  japan as companies drive higher  level of shareholder return and  take advantage of it. many clients told us when  talking about japan, oh, we miss that. right? it's been the best performing  equity market in the last three  years then you have an  opportunity that came about over the course of the last couple of days to put money to work and  investor for a longer term. >> how do you think about bonds  right now? >> we think that the sort of  fair value for the ten-year is  still around that 4.25 level so  when i walked in, 3.85 or so so  we think rates will move up a  little bit and shortened  duration in the context of our  fixed income portfolios but if  you look at long-term inflation  expectations, real rates, term  premium, we think around 4.25  for the ten-year is fair value.  >> how much should we like or  not the banks right now and the  reason i was thinking about the  banks, just i mean they're not  even in the mortgage business  anymore but there is commercial  real estate and big questions as to what's going on there.  >> financial sector is changed a lot over the course of 20 years, the 2007/'08 period is embedded  in our memory bank, particularly us.  >> yes.  >> the soundness of the  financial system is clearly  improved over the course of that period of time so i think the  banks, you know, in an economy  if you go back to the comment i  made around the foundation of  the economy being relatively  sound there's some cracks. if you look at quarterly  earnings out some of the  consumer companies they talked  about, you know, some concerns  about consumer spending  particularly at the lower end  but nonetheless, i think the  system is sound, and the economy is there so from a credit  standpoint it should be okay.  >> what about if your clients  call and you say do i still want own nvidia or not? that's the hardest part about  the whole situation.  >> these stocks have moved an  enormous amount. oh, my god, nvidia is down 6%. it was up 100% still just this  year so these are amazing  high-quality companies that have delivered extraordinary returns  over the course of the last  number of years. we think there's going to be a  broadening out and start to move into a rate cut cycle. that will be important so the  narrowness of the market  leadership that we've seen which is a concern of ours and a  concern of a lot of folks we  think you want to broaden out  and have more exposure to sick

Title: S&P Global's Dan Yergin: 'Quite striking' oil markets haven't preemptively priced in Mideast tension
Transcript:
morning, pairing yesterday's  losses, as concern that an  escalating middle east conflict  could hit supplies. joining us is dan jurgen, s&p  global vice chairman and author  of the book, "the new map:  energy, climate, and the clash  of nations." it's all 50/50 supply/demand,  dan. sometimes does one or the other  become more important, and what  now is really the lever for  controlling prices. >> i think right now, it is, in  fact, demand. you know, there's recession  fears, which you've just seen in the general financial markets,  and it's quite striking that oil markets so far, is not  preemptively pricing in the risk of what seems to be a very  imminent conflict. and saudi arabia has just told  all of its citizens sleave  lebanon, iran has told its  pirates to leave air space. there's some sense of a  disruption of supplies yet. >> did opec's mentality change  and their plans? do you think they're going to  amend or change any of the  things that they decided to do,  either based on the demand or  what happens in the middle east, in the conflict. >> yeah, well, you know, next in october, they're supposed to  start raising supply, and they  just reiterated that they're  supposed to do that, but they  said, of course, they completely reserve the right to not do that if market conditions change, and clearly, among all of those  countries in the middle east,  including the oil producers,  there's a terrible fear that --  of war that would be bigger than what we have seen so far,  involving hezbollah and israel. >> why did -- after october 7th, and everything -- you know,  everything we've seen. and it's been a wide conflict  already, not as wide as what  we're talking about, obviously,  if it's not just iran proxies,  but why wasn't there more of an  affect then? was that offset by weakening  demand? >> i think it's been demand. i think the market -- the market participants have gotten out,  you know, accustomed to no  longer reacting before something happens. the other thing, joe, that i  think is really important, and  maybe we're going to hear about  in a presidential campaign is  the shale revolution. the western hemisphere now  produces more oil than the  middle east, and the number one  source, of course, is the united states. and i think that has been a  great stabilizer. if we were still in 40, 60% of  our oil, you could be sure that  the price would be a lot higher  than it is today. >> can you give us an idea of  what it says about whether the  globe is slowing more than  people thought? or even whether the united  states is, whether china is,  whether europe is? can we glean anything from what  we're seeing in oil about -- are we on the cusp of a recession in this country? >> well, i think if you look --  one of the things we look at  carefully is chinese oil  imports. china has been basically about  half of the total growth in oil  demand. and we were quite struck in the  first half of this year, chinese oil demand, the imports were  lower than they, you know, have  been, which kind of breaks the  trend. i think the other thing is, i  was just looking at the s&p  pmis, and there is a more mixed  picture, because it shows  manufacturing weakening in the  u.s., and services strong. so -- but you know, as you know, and you've been talking about  for the last few days, is that  this kind of mentality and fear  of recession is there, and  that's going to affect commodity prices. >> yeah, psychologically. and it's a self-fulfilling at  times, and a virtuous cycle or  whatever it is. all right, dan. i don't know. it's been kind of boring, you  know. oil, normally --  >> that may be famous last  words, you know, since we seem  to be maybe only hours away from something we haven't seen before in the middle east. >> well, i don't want that,  obviously. none of us want that to happen. but i like 30 to 150. i like that range. and crazy, we saw -- we saw --  you know, i want to get paid to  take some oil. i've got some tanks built into  my backyard. remember when you could actually make money, you know, getting a  delivery. yeah. >> during covid, you know, the  discussion you see now, people

now about 120, 130% of gdp is  starting to be a problem. >> yeah! >> by the way, i have something  i want to mention. >> you're going to --  >> i want to talk about bitcoin. >> don't look at me. don't point at me! >> a speculative thing. and at one point, bitcoin proved once again that it's not a hedge against your ss melting. >> it's just a speculative  asset. >> it's a speculative asset that seems to -- just like behave,  you know, like high-priced real  estate in manhattan, for it to  attract the stock market. >> that may be true, but you're  losing your ass from when you  told me it was useless at  $30,000. >> i'm saying it's useless,  doesn't mean -- doesn't mean i  didn't invest in. there are a lot of things i  didn't invest in. >> i want you to short it,  instead of just talking, i want  you to short it or buy it. do one or the other? >> that's exactly the kind of  false dichotomy that you're  causing. i'm telling you, it's an asset  that's crazy. enough crazy people to drive it  up. >> what do you think will happen long-term? >> i have no idea. >> i have no idea. it's a speculative asset. it's not useful in a system to  have assets that go from $10,000 to $60,000, when you're looking  for price stability. >> but that's an underlying  company that actually produces  something that makes a product. this is not that? >> on any given day, whatever  it's worth is totally ephemeral. >> let me tell you the problem  with bitcoin people --  >> nvidia went from $6 to $400. >> it's revolutionizing the  world. >> who knows if bitcoin is doing that. >> but it's not. >> but there are people who  think it is. >> how so? it's become a speculative asset. that's what it is. the product is being a  speculative asset. >> it has a function until use  in terms of what constitutes --  like actual money. >> that's exactly -- that's  exactly what you're getting  wrong. it's approving that the -- it  can be anything, but it's not a  currency. and it's not a hedge, all right? so treat it as a -- listen, a  lot of people buy expensive  paintings. >> what are the characteristics, for example, of gold? it's immutable, cross-cultural,  it's a limited supply. there are all of these different things -- it has a lot of those  charac characteristics. >> gold has a property that  bitcoin doesn't --  >> what, to make jewelry? >> as you said, there's one  property. it's that -- if you put -- okay, i have a gold chain. if you put it on the ground for  10,000 years, it will still be  gold. bitcoin, if the -- you know, the players in bitcoin --  >> right, if you unplug the  servers. >> you can still have it. you don't need a server. >> no, but it has to be  maintained, okay? and this is complicated  >> the entire world is based on  something being plugged in at  this point. >> but gold isn't. gold is not. >> and gold held its value -- it was stable, up until the hunt,  until '73, when --  >> but gold is stable -- it's  worth about what -- it's worth,  like a suit. it's worth a good suit,  apparently. over the years, you can buy a  good suit of clothes for  whatever gold cost. >> okay, the idea of taking the  story of gold --  >> no, the characteristics --  there are about six or seven  characteristics that bitcoin  shares with gold. and --  >> the argument is not -- i'm  arguing --  >> on the old days, if you lived on an island -- if you did an  hour of work, you did one thing, and somebody else did another  thing, you need a way to keep  track of your work. it's a distributed ledger, that  does that --  >> it looks like we're not going to go anywhere --  >> you can use shells --  >> well, the world is  actually -- you're kind of --  the world is coming around. >> how many bitcoins have you  used to buy your newspaper and  your coffee --  >> okay, now you're using the  use cases. now you've moved from --  >> i'm saying, it's approving  not to be a currency, and it  doesn't have the same attributes of gold. i'm not complaining. a lot of people like crazy  stuff, okay? >> it's different -- it's not a  pet rock. >> don't make it --  >> it's just not. >> well, in hindsight, we'll  see. up to this point, you don't  admit that you've miscalculated  on bitcoin? you still think you're right? i know people who hated it at  5,000 and still think they're  right. i myself told you --  >> is it going to zero? >> no. >> it should based on --  >> if it will go 1 milli

Title: Tech stock sell-off: What investors need to know
Transcript:
the three worst-performing of  the magnificent seven over the  last three trading sessions. all down between 11 and 13%. only meta is positive since last thursday, when the most recent  selling bout started. joining us now on what he's  watching in the tech sector, ray wong, constellation research  principle analyst. good morning, again. good to see you, ray. would you buy everything right  now, on a pullback, or buy  nothing? >> well, i was going to wait to  see what was going on with some  other data points wi, to see if  were in full panic mode or if we were going to come back. we had a pullback, people were  coming back to their senses and  realized one data point wasn't  going to trigger everyone into  an over correction. it's a good time to look into  this. there are a few stocks that are  actually winning in ai and  nvidia, of course, is still  going to be there. we've got to wait until august  28th to figure out how they're  going to -- what their forecasts for q3 are going to be. but more importantly, they're  still going to be one of the  winners. you mentioned amazon. that will be interesting to  watch in the long run, because  we're seeing if the retail  sector does come down and  there's pullback in terms of  consumer spending, i would be  worried about amazon. but there are some interesting  things. we are seeing people make money  in ai, and uber, for example,  yesterday, said, look, better  price matching, better ride  batching. our improvements have improved  their abilities to get more  profitability. and meta has done something  great with their open models. what it's actually allowing them to do is open source their mlms, but improve their precision  targeting for ad growth. meta is great stock in that  regard. and nvidia is a good one in  terms of what you've mentioned. . >> so, ray, when we go through  periods like this that, you  know, in this case, maybe it was based on a carry trade or a  currency fluctuations, do you  just ignore it? do you just focus on what you  know about each one of the  companies individually, or  worry, well, the multiple is  kind of rich, depending on what  happens in the macro world,  everything could be marked down. how do you do it? do you just look for  opportunities to get long and  what you like? >> right now, it's really about  opportunities to get long on the ai revolution. and you have to figure out which companies will make money in ai. a simple example, adobe is  making money on ai, selling ai  software. microsoft, we'll see how they do well in terms of what apps  they're selling. oracle has done a great job,  palantir is a company that's  been in the space. c3 has been in the space. we want to see who has the  revenue growth. it comes down to the forecast of what's out there. it is individual stocks. but the macro was a bigger  issue. that notion of debt that was  being discussed earlier is true. china is in serious trouble. it's a market with lower  population growth and the debt  bubble, they're going to be in a tough spot. they're going to look like japan in 20 years, and japan got  crushed, but mmt doesn't work. so a u.s. jo

Title: Fmr. Atlanta Fed President: Weakening is strong enough for Fed to also cut in November and December
Transcript:
austin goolsbee told us that he  and his colleagues would react  toigns of weakness in the  economy. joining us right now is former  atlanta fed president, denis  lockhart, a professor at georgia tech. it's great to see you this  morning. and i just laid it out there. what do you think the fed is  going to do come september, if  not before? >> i doubt they're going to do  anything before, but i think  it's probably very probable --  it's probably very probable --  it's very probable that they  will move in september. there's more data to come  between now and the meeting. and who knows, we could see  confusing data coming in. in situations that are iffy,  often the leadership of the  chair really matters. so i would be watching the  jackson hole speech to see if  there's any indication of which  direction jay powell's leaning. >> and how aggressive do you  think he will actually be in  september? >> you know, i think the  preferred mode is 25 basis  points. that's really the default mode  of the fed. 50 basis points is not  completely off the table, i  think. i think there's some chance of  that, but that would imply  catch-up that i don't believe  the committee thinks they're  having to do at the moment. so, you know, my best guess at  this time, subject to the data  coming in, that are consistent  of what we've seen, is that 25  basis points move in september. >> and how do you think about  the rest of the year, calendar  year, that is, and maybe into  25? the reason i ask is, we had  somebody on earlier from  newburgher berman, who suggested that he thought it was possible  that the fed, maybe they don't  cut aggressively, 50 basis  points in september, but that  there'll be more cuts on the  table over the coming six months than maybe the market's  anticipating right now. >> well, you always have to kind of frame this as, what are the  data going tell the committee  about the evolution of the  economy? so if you have a crystal ball  that can look to december, then  maybe you can make some  prediction as to how the cuts  will unfold. the default mode is 25 basis  points a meeting. i wouldn't totally rule out that they decide to go every other  meeting, but at the moment, it  looks like the weakening is  strong enough, strong enough  weakening, that they would go 25 basis points in november and  december. >> and when you -- i don't know  if you got a chance to hear  austin goolsbee on the show  yesterday, he said, if the  numbers are the numbers, we will react. how behind do you think the fed  has been? have they been too reactive? >> well, they're dealing with an economy that i think has been  char characterized correctly as  somewhat unique coming out of  the covid period with unusual  combinations of data, for  example, rising unemployment, at the same time with healthy job  creation, up until at least last friday. so, you know, i think they are,  by necessity, in a little bit  more of a reactive mode, because there are surprises that come  through. you know, having said that,  they're trying to stay very  steady, i think, and deliberate, and sober about this. so that's another reason why i  think the default mode of 25  basis points is probably what  they'll do in september. >> and then, i wanted to ask  you, i don't know if you saw,  there was a story about a  research report, neuroroe  roubini and another researcher  put together saying they believe that the treasury department was effectively trying to manipulate the treasury market in a way  that only they could, because  they thought the fed wasn't --  they were almost acting against  the fed's interest. did you see that? i was curious about your view  about it? >> i didn't see the article. you know, i hesitate to comment  at all, because i just -- i  don't know the gist of the  argument. you know --  >> fair enough. it's always great to talk you,  especially given neemtzs. one last piece. when you think about this carry  trade coming undone in japan,  how much should we be focused on what's happening in europe with  interest rates, what's happening in japan with interest rates and how much is that ultimately even get thought about in the room  when jay powell will have to  make the ultimate decision in  september? >> well, my experience over ten  years at the fed, the great  majority of comments are about  the domestic economy. and the international influences on the u.s. domestic economy are mentioned, there are reports on  them, and so forth, but we tend  to not to dwell on that, because the u.s. economy is such a  mammoth engine in and of itself, that sometimes these foreign  influences just are secondary. they're minor compared to what's going on with the consumer and  the u.s. you know, i think we have to  keep an eye on the wiring of the global financial system and we  saw a little bit of evidence  yesterday with japan unwinding  some of their carry trade  positions. it can have an influence on  markets, and markets can have an influence on the domestic  econom

Transcript:
don't miss an exclusive  interview with jamie dimon  tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. eastern  time on "the exchange," joe. >> let's talk more about the  banks and the recent sell-off. joining us now, mccrae sykes. we've -- as time has gone on, we were just talking to rick  santelli and others, mccrae. we're looking at this as now  sort of as a carry trade unwind, not necessarily anything that  onerous about the u.s. economy. and i guess the banking sector. is that what you think? >> two weeks ago, we were here,  talking about how great the  banks were doing, reporting  season, capitalization,  buybacks, et cetera. so they were all doing pretty  well. good feedback. fast forward now, we're talking  about fed hikes, emergency  meetings, recession --  >> fed cuts. >> fed cuts. and so i don't think that even  though the stocks have sold off, i don't think the fundamentals  have changed in two weeks. >> no. >> they haven't, no. >> and there was a little bit of a perfect storm, too, over the  weekend with buffet selling some of those securities. you know, he still owns $35  billion worth of bank of  america. a lot of other financials, as  well. so, you know, that gets included in the mix. but i stand today. i like wells fargo, a couple of  weeks ago. you know, now it's a little bit  cheaper. 1.2 times forward tangible book  value. and i believe in kind of the  american tail wind of  prosperity. and i think they'll do well. so it's another opportunity to  buy. >> you don't think at this  point, that the labor market is  weaker than we're aware, or that it could worsen more quickly  than we think? you don't -- that's not in the  cards? >> we look at stocks on a  bottoms up basis, and i don't  really get into the weeds in  terms of the economy. >> so not macro. >> we follow that and look at  rates and so on, but in terms of analyzing one particular data  point from jobs is not totally  important to the work we do. what i would say, though, is  that just the feedback we've  gotten from the banks in terms  of the trajectory, they're also  reserved for higher employment  of 5% by the end of the year. there are some expectations of  that movement in unemployment  rates. not terribly unanticipated. as far as credit and all of that concerns go. >> so at this point, in terms of consumer credit or, i don't  know, loans, none of that is  signaling a worse slowdown than  what the fed has tried  orchestrate, a soft landing? >> yeah, i think that's correct. just given the trajectory and  feedback we've gotten in july as well. >> and just to talk about that,  this lower ten-year rate over  the last couple of days, you've  started to see the mortgage  rates come in, 6.25 yesterday. so that secretly will be an  injection of good opportunity  for the housing market, and  that's a benefit to the banks as well that are owning asf or mbf  securities. that will help book values, help refinancing and the whole  housing market. >> do you think that the  ten-year, it can be almost,  like, things can get out of hand and it can go further down --  i'm talking about the yield, and it's more of a psychological --  pause, we take that seriously. when you see money rush in  through the ten-year, you really do start to question everything. you think about everything else. is it possible that that gives a false signal? >> absolutely. i think if we just look at the  expectations for rate cuts,  january 1st, you know, the  forward curve was five to six  rates cuts for '24. by may, it was one cut. >> now we're back to fife or  six. >> within two weeks. so i mean, predicting all of  this stuff is really difficult. but i will say that with  inflation, sub-3%, fed funds  rate at 5 from  our perspective on a longer-term basis you'll think that -- the  yield curve will eventually  normalize and that will be good  for banks.  >> back to 25 in september and  another at a before the end of  the year, is that all we get,  would you bet on that? i'm not going to ask you to  stake your life on it. i wouldn't stake it on anything  for --  >> no.  >> is that it, 50 basis points  this year, that's it? >> i think the longer-term trend is definitely down. when we get that, maybe it's  important to some people. i don't think it really is  important to jp morgan's  earnings over the next few  months, four months. so i think the trend is good. i think inflation is good. and ultimately, that will be  good.  >> your favorite is wells fargo  still? >> correct.  >> but jp morgan, just in terms  of book value, is too expensive  or you buy that, buy all of  them, buy a basket? >> on a price to value basis  wells fargo is a great  opportunity. jp morgan trading over two times book, great execution, well  positioned for the fundamental  growth in the economy. but, a little more valuable at  this point for the -- even  janney diamond has talked  about --  >> buffett -- i don't think what he's thinking but if bank of  america is going up it makes no  sense to sell it, does it? >> a number of reasons they're  selling. you know, he talked about at the may meeting, you know, wanting  to get --  >> a long time, though.  >> potentially higher corporate  tax rates and they have huge  embedded gains in the stocks. so perhaps there

Transcript:
than a half an hour to the  opening bell. joining us is liz young thomas. good morning to you.  >> good morning.  >> heck of a day yesterday.  >> sure was.  >> see whether today is a heck  of a day too. what are you seeing, what are  you thinking? and how is the service working? some other folks were actually  really having some problems.  >> there were a lot of problems  yesterday which happens on days  when you have a lot of activity  that nobody's prepared for.  >> we've got to fix that at some point.  >> yes, yes, as far as i know we didn't have any problems. but what i would say about  yesterday, it's difficult in  this kind of period because  there's so much uncertainty. you have to focus on what you do you know? we know in the short term  markets tend to overshoot both  on the up and the down. what's looking like is happening today is that we overshot  yesterday on the down. usually that gets exacerbated by lgos, probably some of that  happened, we had a lot of  unwinding that was going on. but the other thing i would say  is that something i feel pretty  certain about is you don't have  events like that yesterday and  just dust yourself off and  pretend it never happened. nothing's been resolved yet. we still have issues with the  yen. i don't think that's over. we still have economic  uncertainty. i don't think that's over. it's going to be a long time  until we hear from the fed in a  scheduled way. if we hear from them before i  think that would be good but i  don't see there being any real  reason for an emergency move  from them right now.  >> how do you think about the  seven stocks that basically make up the majority of what you see  in the s&p, and by the way,  nvidia, apple, amazon, and  everybody else.  >> so, coming into this, first  of all, the other thing to  remember is although days like  yesterday can feel really scary, the headlines are very scary,  japan went zero to bear market  in three days. all that very terrifying, the  swings in the treasury market  that shouldn't happen. coming into this it was from a  really high level and we'll  really only down about 8% in the s&p, that's nothing compared to  a normal correction. we still have room to go. and that high level was achieved by mostly those seven stocks, so when you hit the skids and you  hit volatility, a lot of the  stuff that has most of the gains and is the most lick quid is the easiest to sell, the first to  go. it feels the most pain on the  downside. that's okay too. we needed a little bit of a  right sizing in what's driving  the market.  >> you want to weigh in on this  crypto debate we've been having  on this day? >> what's the debate? >> the bedate was that it's not  correlated to anything at this  point. or correlated exactly to the  nasdaq.  >> in this environment it has  been correlated to the nasdaq  because it's trading like a risk asset. if the japanese yen thing  continues crypto will save us  because it will be uncorrelated  to currency volatility, that's  possible. the rise we saw early in 2024  has already been that piece. so, this yen thing is not new. this has been going on for a  while.  >> every time there's something  terrible happens in the world,  in the markets.  >> yeah.  >> someone tries to assassinate  the former president, what  happens, gold goes up, and  bitcoin acts as if it's nvidia.  >> so -- and this is my  speculation, my opinion, i don't have necessarily proof of this. i would suspect that many of the investors who are heavy in  crypto, there's an overlap with  the investors who are heavy in  tech, heavy in headline makers.  >> seems like.  >> when everybody in that basket gets nervous, you have  indiscriminate selling and you  see all of the risk assets in  that basket go down. i think that's what's happening  right now, that's what happened  yesterday, and what's been  building for the last week or  so.  >> what are you smiling about? >> i mean, you know, gold  basically where it was 10, 15  years ago.  >> that's true, too.  >> it goes up $30.  >> isn't going down.  >> bitcoin was 4,000.  >> value.  >> bitcoin was 4,000 and went up to 75,000. when it goes -- when people who  don't like bitcoin took a  victory lap when it fell back  down to 17,000. and falls to 50, take another  victory lap. if it keeps doing this, being  the best performing asset for  one year, five year, ten years  and 15 years, sooner or later  the store valley arguments is  not going to be true.  >> i sort of agree with that. but then you have to assume that everybody's going to sit in it  for five years, ten years, 15  years.  >> they haven't so far.  >> you don't know about  holdlers? >> i know very well, but because of the volatility we see that  tells me people don't stick  around entirely. if it is a store valley you  don't want to see that kind of  volatility in an asset class  that's expected to be a store  value.  >> i don't know any -- do you  think stocks are a store value? >> no, not -- no.  >> i don't either.  >> i think they're grown to  volatility.  >> volatility.  >> but they do something.  >> well, that -- see, then you  change the rules of the game  again because there are people  that think that bitcoin does  something too. what would it take for you to  finally sa

Title: DOJ's Kanter on Google antitrust ruling: We're interested in ensuring the competitive market works
Transcript:
when it comes to corporate  taxes, they'll go up, if ms.  harris wins.  >> yeah.  >> let's bring in the guest of  the day, for network, landmark  decision, federal judge has  ruled google violating any  antitrust law by maintaining a  monopoly over internet search. jonathan kanter, assistant  attorney general, joins us first on cnbc, and mr. kanter,  congratulations on a very, very  big win.  >> thank you, jim, great to be  with you again.  >> let me ask you, when a judge  rules that someone is a  monopolist, which means  exclusive agreements have  reduced incentive, and  innovation, what could possibly  be the remedy? because, how do you break the  exclusive agreement? how do you get incentives and  innovation started again? >> sure, this is a familiar  problem, so this -- these kinds  of exclusive agreements were at  the center of the usb microsoft  case and the court observed  there, as i would observe here,  that there are remedies for all  things but death, and at the end of the day, what's most  important is that we meet the  market where it is, we reflect  market realities as they exist  today, and we look ahead at what the next inflection points  coming down the pipe are in  terms of competition and protect them from anti competitive  conduct.  >> mr. kanter, while google won, it would seem there's an  unintended consequence here,  apple, which is who's involved  in getting the payments, they  lose the payments. it's most likely, as the judge  says over and over again, that  google's predominance won't  change because it has a superior product. so isn't the loser apple, not  google? >> well, the losers were  competition during the conduct,  the anti competitive scheme that google perpetrated, but the  loser, the decision, is google. google is a monopolist. it illegally obtained its  monopoly power and now we need a remedy to sufficiently address  the anti competitive conduct and provide opportunities for new  invate fors to reach market. there will be a process in  place, the court has ordered a  conference in september, and  we'll talk about remedies. but like i said before, in a  market that involves technology  and dynamic products, it's  important that remedies actually meet the moment in all of our  cases, and that they meet the  market where it is right now.  >> well, assistant attorney  general kanter, you just said  it, you said that you have to  take care of watching what the  changes are, the dynamic. i have here in my hand a july  25th search gpt prototype that  microsoft, using co pilot, and  search gpt wants to put together and will do a search engine. there's 200 pages devoted to  fact that there's no competitor  to search. you have to do this. could you not be overridden by  the events of july 25th, 2024  prototype.  >> those are factual questions,  the court addressed in its  lengthy opinion, relied on  expert testimony as well as  documents and data. the fact of the matter is,  competition matters most when  there are new inflection points  that emerge in the market, and  monopolies have the greatest  incentive during inflection  points to siphon competition  before it has the opportunity to take hold. right now is perhaps the most  critical inflection point we've  seen in the search market in 15  years, and making sure that it  has the opportunity that  competitors have the opportunity to compete on the merits,  benefit of their own  innovations, and win or lose  based on the merits of their  products is the most important  thing right now.  >> mr. kanter, just a couple of  questions on process, so  investors can get an  understanding. what happens, you mentioned  you're going to be, in  september, you're going to be,  what, talking about remedies  with the judge, google, i would  assume, has an opportunity to be a part of that as well. can you give our viewers is a  sense as to what happens from  here, both that, the remedies,  and then what's going to be an  obvious appeal and how that all  plays out and whether remedies  take place in the interim or  wait for the appeal to actually  take place as well? >> yeah, so that will have to  play out in the core process,  and i want to respect that, so i can't really comment other than  to say that the court will order a path forward. in the past there are cases  where courts have effectively  conducted a remedies trial,  there are other cases where  different outcomes, and  different processes were put in  place. that will be up to the court. we look forward to being there,  and we look forward to making  the arguments we need to make in order to protect competition.  >> are you going to -- you won't share in any way what you would  like to see in terms of a  remedy, or are you willing to do that? >> it's premature for us to talk about that right now, we look  forward to engaging with the  court throughout that process,  for today we're really thrilled  with the outcome, i'm really  proud of our team which fought  day in and day out against a  formidable adversary to bring  the facts forward and we have a  decisive victory at hand.  >> mr. attorney general, what is wrong with google paying apple? >> so, we covered this in our  case. it's one thing to companies to  engage in legitimate commercial  interactions. it's another thing to pay  somebody in exchange for  exclusivity. it's another thing to pay  somebody with a requirement that they don't work with a rival. those are the kinds of issues  that when you have massive  amounts of monopoly power can  violate the law. the law is pretty clear here. and we brought those facts. we explained why it was a  problem. we explained why it harmed  competition. and ultimately, we succeeded in  convincing a court, and we have  a very lengthy detailed opinion  that explains all of this.  >> you know, i read the opinion. i'm just concerned about the  possibility that a company with  the superior product paying  apple, someone, this is valuable real estate. you can't just ask apple to give the real estate to whoever wants it.  >> right. again, the case focus is not on  the fact that there were  payments that companies are  engaging in commercial  contracts. the case focuses on the  conditions that accompanied  those payments. that's a really important aspect of the opinion. again, these kinds of exclusive  arrangements are not new to  antitrust law. they've been discussed for  generations, and so the concepts that we brought forward here are well within the mainstream of  antitrust enforcement.  >> okay. i'm watching a piece that the  "new york times" wrote, not that long ago, about regulators  close, and nvidia scrambles for  a response and i read this and  say to myself, is it possible,  not unlike when bobby kennedy  was the attorney general, that  there was a get hot squad there, i wonder, honestly, whether  there's a get big tech squad  within the justice department.  >> i can assure you that no such thing exists. we follow the facts and the law. we are about rule of law. but i think it's important to  kind of dispel this notion, we  want companies to compete, we  want companies to succeed. we don't bring very many  antitrust every year, it's a  small handful, and we only do so when the facts and the law  support it. i spent about two weeks ago i  was out in the bay area, and i  spent time with vcs founders  from across the technology  industry, and what i heard was  that they overwhelmingly support our tech cases. why? because they want to build and  invest in businesses that have  the opportunity to succeed, and  become durable and thrive on the competitive stage. that's exactly what we want to  promote, and that's exactly why  antitrust enforcement exists in  the first place. we're not interested in  regulating companies, we are  interested in making sure that  the competit

>>> welcome back. time for stop trading with jim. what do you got? >> i'm trying to figure out  which is the real economy and  which is the japan carry trade  risk off nonsense. i thought of royal caribbean. jpmorgan put it on its focus  list today. the stock up 11. that is not a sign of recession. you do not take a royal  caribbean trip if you are  strapped or maybe if you're  frugal because there is value  there, but again i found it's  like -- two worlds, world of  ridiculous hedge funds over  extended and getting out of  everything and the world of  royal caribbean which is good.  >> you think the talk about  recession is overblown.  >> totally. the stock market is led 50% of  the advance is led by a couple  of stocks, and there's a lot of  people who feel that nvidia is  now become the helpless giant  that everyone is after. nvidia was the linchpin for the  rally.  >> a lot of it and the engine  behind a lot of others.  >> the idea ai is not playing a  role when you have palantir and  saying there's huge orders with  ai, servicenow, huge orders with ai, i believe that salesforce  will say huge orders. amazon is using a lot of ai and  apple tied in for microsoft with ai, search gpt being developed  as of july 25th. those who think that ai is not  real and does not -- is not  additive will be left behind.  >> you're not alone in that as  well. what do we got on the big show? >> a company that has not  surfaced in a long time. international flavors and  fragrances. one of the great blue chips of  the last century that is making  a terrific comeback, so i can't  wait to speak to them.  >> awesome.  >> congratulations in the  justice department. that's a big win. >> it was a big win yesterday.  >> and by the way, just so you  know, people use mr. cantor from paul weiss, remarkable job. i've used paul weiss all my  life. the justice department has great lawyers. they really do. >> thanks, jim.  >> thank you. wow, david, thank you. that's the nicest thing you've  said to me

Title: Goldman's Peter Oppenheimer: this correction is healthy and somewhat inevitable but may not be over
Transcript:
turn back to the markets and  joining us goldman's chief  global equity strategist peter  oppenheimer and mike santoli who remains. peter, you know, globally  speaking, as you do, what can  you tell us about the impact  we've seen from the unwind of  the end carry trade, how far it  has to go and what you think  about the impacts it's had on  markets over here? >> well, i think that the setup  of this correction is important  for context. bear in mind it came after one  of the strongest first half of  the u.s. equity market in many  decades and since the trough of  the markets we saw last october. global equities had already  risen by about a third and the  nasdaq by about a half. we'd seen this tremendous rise. a lot of complacency built into  the markets, really, as a  function of optimism about ai. in the csense this correction ws healthy and somewhat inevitable  after a long period without a  pullback, particularly as you  started to get some signs that  the u.s. economy was slowing. we'd already seen good evidence  that was happening in europe and china. my feeling is that this  correction while stabilizing is  not over. we'll see choppy environments in the short term, as investors  really start to calibrate and  get more confident again about  the direction of interest rates  in the economy, but at the same  time, i think we're not in a  bear market and there are going  to be opportunities there.  >> all right. so a little bit of everything  here. you know, mike mentioned earlier the multiple on the nasdaq, for  example, has come down. it's around 24 times. is that enough to encourage some who might otherwise not have  taken a chance to say okay,  fundamentally at least it seems  like a decent entry point? >> well, i think it's probably  not come down enough. the u.s. equity market broadly  has margin nated in valuation a  little bit. it's right on top of it on its  long-term range, that's true  whether you exclude the largest  tech stocks as well. now, admittedly, lower interests as they come through and the  markets are expecting that now,  will help to stabilize the  markets and valuations, but i  think we could see a bigger  shakeout in valuations before  you really start to get value  investors seeking out as a good  correction opportunity.  >> mike, we've seen in the last  24 hours, quite a bit of fed  soothe saying. a market that has rapidly move  to price in much more in terms  of rate cuts before the end of  this year and even steve liesman this morning sharing from his  own reporting that perhaps 50  basis points is now on the table in september. wouldn't necessarily take a  recession or a growth scare to  get there. it's just the fact that fed's  forecasts are now playing catch  up to what we're seeing in the  data. how much does that matter here? >> that's right. i think solidifying around  perhaps a september cut, not an  emergency cut, before that, and  50 basis points does make sense, because the market recognizes  usually that once an easing  campaign begins, it's the  beginning of a series and if you look at the gap between the fed  funds rate at 5.38 and where the two-year yield is trading it's  massive. fed is late and has more to do. i think that's fine. i don't know that we can go to  the historical playbooks and say here's how the market behaves  because it hasn't conformed to  those patterns to this point in  terms of how we've traded into  the first fed hike, bottoming  when we're still tightening, but i think it would take the  pressure off if the consensus  coalesces around that idea. by the way, rate sensi

off their worse day in nearly  two years. bitcoin staging a comeback, up  more than 5% and crypto names  like coinbase and micro strategy are attempting comebacks here. joining us to discuss is michael saylor, co-founder and chairman  of micro strategy. great to speak with you. thanks for being back.  >> thanks for having me.  >> we did see this mini crash in bitcoin yesterday. it's traded as a risk on asset,  at least one technician i've  spoken to in the last 24 hours  said we're range bound up to  61,000. what's the next catalyst and  what praex it out? >> i think the events of bitcoin 2024 in nashville a few weeks  ago were just very catalytic and the market inflection for  bitcoin. you had presidential candidates  and governors, you had senators, you had house members, you had  ceos, billionaire investors in  the audience. senator lamez presented a  bitcoin reserve bill and that's  our louisiana purchase moment. what happened there was we --  the window shift. now it's possible to discuss  nation states holding bitcoin on the balance sheet and if nation  states are going to buy it it's  reasonable for institutions,  corporations and individuals to  buy it as well.  >> former president trump got  behind the idea too. it's a good idea. you think a strategic reserve  for bitcoin is a good idea? >> well, thomas jefferson  purchased the louisiana  territory for $15 million in  1803 and nearly doubled the size of the united states. seeward paid $7 million for  alaska, has a trillion dollars  of oil underneath it. everybody is going to be doing  business in cyber space. bitcoin is scarce desirable  digital property, a great idea  to trade a little bit of  currency or paper for some place that billions of people are  going to want in 100 years. i think it's a great idea.  >> interesting. i mean i feel like there's  always been this ethos around  bitcoin and crypto currency in  general decentralized digital  gold, you called it digital real estate, a hedge against  inflation, hedge against  government spending too much  money, for example, so the idea  that governments would be  holding it seems like it goes  against that.  >> you know, it's desirable  property and if you're  capitalizing a country based  upon scarce desirable property,  buying manhattan, buying the  united states, buying alaska,  anywhere you can do business,  it's the basis of the great  empire. no, i think it's a good idea for a nation, but it's an equally  good idea for a cooperation, an  individual, a family or the  like.  >> okay. so bitcoin and crypto currency  is on the ballot. what's at stake then in november ? >> what you have is two  constituencies. traditional finance and  traditional finance operates 19% of the time. it costs $40 million to take a  company public. there's no credit, no liquidity  on the weak end. bitcoin represents a different  thing, and it represents the  21st century. so i think the millennials are  looking at the world today and  they think, electricity, water,  elevators, the internet, they  operate 100% of the time.  bitcoin operates 100% of the  time. why are we stuck with 20th  century banks, money markets and capital markets that shut us  down at 4:00 p.m. on friday,  don't open up until 9:

Title: CSX CEO on earnings: We see a strong second half of the year for us
Transcript:
we're glad to be with you.  >> i know you're navigating some hurricane impacts here. recession fears, they've been  ripping through the markets in  recent day, although maybe a  little calmer here today. how would you characterize the  demand environment right now? >> yeah, i would say it's mixed  but generally positive. the chemical business has been  up year over year, intermodal. housing lately, autos, some  metals and steels have been down lately so we're watching that  carefully. we see a strong second half of  the year, the things we have  visibility to. we're still feeling good about  where things are. we have meaningful margin  expansion in the second half of  the year. that largely comes from the back of holding costs flat.  >> listening to you, it sounds  like you think soft landing  thesis is still intact? >> i think so. we're anxious to see what the  fed does in september, to be  sure. the auto industry, watch that  very carefully. in july we saw shipments throw  down a little bit. watching that one very  carefully. as you've seen the steel  companies come out with their  earnings, announcements, not a  great year for them. those areas we're watching  carefully but we expect a strong harvest in the fall, which will  be good for us, chemical is  strong, export coal business is  strong, aggregate construction  is strong. mixed but generally positive. >> the steel piece of this and  the metals piece, that's  particularly interesting to me. we know a lot of government  money has pushed out into  infrastructure, pushed out into  other things like i.r.a., et  cetera. have we seen the peak in terms  of these infrastructure  projects? should investors think that  spending has been deployed? >> we're still seeing on  construction, aggregate, rocks  that goes into. consumer is more driven more  than construction piece. it's mixed. there's still a lot of  construction going on. industrial development is still  big and strong in the southeast. i think -- we have to watch the  consumer side of this. >> you're expecting low to  single digit revenue growth in  the second half of 2024. what's propelling it, and more  importantly, norfolk southern  ceo came on and said to me,  looks like we're going to get a  peak season, which we haven't  had as retailers and other  consumer-facing companies  rebuild their inventory levels. are you expecting the same  thing? >> we hope so. with big customer bases like  u.p.s., amazon, they are telling us things look pretty good for  the second half of the year. domestic intermoldal has been  down. we're hoping to see that come  true in the second half of the  year. we still think international and modal will be strong coming into the ports, which is good. driving is chemical, export  coal. autos have been strong,  aggregates. we expect the midwest harvest to be strong. we see a lot in the future  that's good for us. we got to make sure the economy  keeps moving forward.  >> okay. labor talks at the east and gulf coast ports, those seem to be  largely stalled. there's rising risks we'll see  strikes by workers at those  ports. how are you gaming that out? what does that mean in terms of  some of these container flows  when you already have die  version as way from the red sea  and issues in the panama canal? >> for us, actually, we don't  see a net negative effect if the eastern ports have a stoppage. we don't expect that. we hope that's not the case. the things that move west still  need to get to the east where  the population is. that means a lot more movement  of rail across the continent  from chicago with us to the east where a lot goes into the ports  in the east gets trucked to new  york, baltimore, philly, et  cetera. it could be a net benefit to us. we don't want that to happen. watching what happens in canada  as well. from a csx standpoint we should  be okay either way. we're gaming it out. our shippers are doing that as  well. for csx we should be in a good  place.  >> we talked about the  meaningful improvement and  operating ratio, better  efficiency, better  profitability. how do you get there? how does pricing factor? >> pricing has been strong on  the merchandising side. we see that continuing. it came off a lot of inflation  the last couple of years. we have a leading service  product and customers are  willing to pay for service to a  certain extent. for us, the second half of the  year is about growing volume and revenue while holding our costs  in line. the last couple of quarters our  costs have come down. we're seeing efficiency from our whole csx 

Title: Markets are going through a growth scare but it's not as bad as people think, says Ritholtz' Cox
Transcript:
>> yeah. a little bit of an unclenching  of tension from yesterday. we'll start with that rebound in stocks and the outlook for the  economy and the fed. with us at post 9, chief market  strategist callie cox. good to see you.  >> it's great to be here. >> s&p 500 at this point, we  regained half of what was lost  just in one day yesterday. still some work to do probably  to sort of prove this is more  than just a reflex bounce. how would you advise investors  thinking in general terms about  a sharp pullback like this and  putting it into context? >> first of all, you have to  look at the fundamentals. yesterday was about positioning. we got good economic data from  the ism services that came out. yesterday was scary. we haven't seen a yen trade blow up like that. not that i can remember. when markets move on those  emotions, you have to stay  grounded.  >> you could counter that by  saying, maybe a lot of the  upside was vibes in positioning, too. where is the right spot here and what is the process, in your  view, look like in terms of  getting the market rebalanced? >> you might be right. when you're in a bull market,  you have to expect 5% to 10%  corrections. right now, we're going through a growth scare. that stuff can take it to a  market. i don't think growth is quite as bad as people think. i don't think the job market is  broke even though it's slowing  down but you have to be braced  for this and understand there's  risk here. you have to have a plan for  these quick selloffs. >> and it was a quick selloff  and speaks to your point, just  how buoyant the market was, that we didn't see corrections up  until this point. you have technicals at play  here, seasonals at play. s claims, jobless claims is  probably the next big thing from a macro standpoint that  potentially moves the market. how much onus is on earnings? >> i think claims are going to  be a big deal. the worry is about the job  market. honestly, earnings have looked  really well. the s&p 500 companies have  beaten their profit expectations by -- i think 80% have beaten  expectations and revenue  performance relative to  expectations is coming up as  well. earnings are in focus. i want to see them broaden out  beyond tech and that's making me feel more confident that the job market isn't as bad as we think. who hires workers, right? corporate america.  >> it's sort of a reminder, i  think, that when we talk about a soft landing, you anticipate a  soft landing, you feel like the  ingredients are in place. the soft landing isn't like this moment you arrive at and say,  oh, things are great. the soft landing is, it could be worse, it could be better, we'll oscillate between those things  for a while. the market, i guess, has to  build in reasonable  probabilities of both things. where do you think we are in  terms of valuations, in terms of the market needing the economy  to really stay at least at above trend pace to redeem where we  trade right now? >> well, this is the other thing that makes me really encouraged. valuations outside of tech still look extremely cheap. there is some unloved areas of  this bull market that did really well over the last few weeks. small caps being one, rate  sensitive sectors being another. they rallied but they are  historically cheap relative to  other parts of the market. if valuations were a little  stretched, i'd be more worried. there would be more of an  expectation priced in. that's not the case. we're telling our investors to  look toward the unloved areas of the bull market and really dig  through for value. >> so, you would be buying  things like small caps right  now. you think the rotation weave  seen in recent weeks, up until a couple of days ago, that that  has legs? >> i think so. if we're right and the job  market is slowing and not  breaking, i think small caps in  rate sensitive sectors have  legs. it's all but certain t

Title: Marc Short on Harris' VP pick: Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is a 'bad omen' for governing philosophy
Transcript:
going to cut rates.  >> we can pretty much bank on  it. thanks.  >> thanks.  >>> vice president kamala harris has selected minnesota governor  tim walz as her running mate in  the 2024 election and former  chief of staff to vp marc short  joins us on the phone. what do investors need to  understand about this pick? >> thank you for having me. i had the fortune to get to know governor walz during covid  because the mayo clinic was  headquartered in minnesota, as  well as 3m, and they were  providing a lot of the medical  equipment. he could not be a more gracious  and kind person. but having said that, i think  it's a bad omen for the  governing philosophy because if  the reporting is accurate and  she was scared away from picking shapiro because of the  pro-palestinian wing of her  party, i think that's a concern  for how she might govern. i don't be think people question she's from the more progressive  part of her party. if she's scared off by the  activists by choosing someone  who's more moderate because he's pro-israel, i think that's a bad signal for how she might govern  if she's in the white house.  >> she's now officially,  officially the democratic  nominee. we now have a vice president  pick. are we going to get more details on policy here? >> i don't know. i certainly hope so but it  certainly appears that i think  president trump will be better  to focus on policy, but instead  he's more focused on  personality. and attacking a popular  republican governor who beat  trump's pick in a primary by 50  points. if that's the case, you may see  the hair kiss campaign decide  why expose ourselves on policy  issues if he's going to hurt  himself by focusing more on  personality? i hope we can get into policy. that doesn't seem like that's  the track we're on at this  point, though. >> marc, it's been common place  to make a big fuss about who the vice president is going to pick  as her vice presidential  candidate and deliver the  disclaimer, usually this doesn't move the needle much in terms of the electoral math, at least  historically that's not the  case. however you are seeing a  signaling effect in terms of the type of person, the policy  priorities, things like that. your experience having worked  for donald trump's vice  president, were there things  that mike pence brought or that  the pick of mike pence conveyed  to the public that was  significant in terms of how he  was going to govern or was that  just a totally different set of  issues? >> well, i think it was. before i was pence's chief of  staff, i was head of legislative affairs in the white house. i think mike brought something  at the time in 2016, the party  was very fractured. mike gave assurances to many  social conservatives of the  partnership with donald trump. i don't think trump had that  challenge in 2004. he doubled a party so he doubled down with jd vance, looking to  how he might govern any  differently. so, i think you're right. it may not add as much  electorally but it might add a  signal to how you might govern. certainly pennsylvania is  probably the most important  state in this year's cycle. so, even if shapiro only would  bump you by 1%, that's nothing  to overlook. >> how much do we put on polls  in this cycle? >> that's a great question. i think the polling industry has been broken the last few cycles. i think what you can tell from  polling is trends. i don't think it's an accurate  today to give you a snapshot of  exactly where you are. but i don't think there's any  doubt you can look at the  dynamics of this race and see  it's turned upside down in a  matter of three weeks from the  trend of where trump was pulling away f

Title: Michael Saylor: Bitcoin 2024 conference 'marked an inflection point for bitcoin'

you know i think the events of bitcoin 2024 in nashville a few weeks ago were just very uh catalytic and marked an inflection point for bitcoin you had presidential candidates you had governors you had senators you had house members you had ceos you had billion investors and the audience senator lumus presented a strategic bitcoin reserve bill and that's our louisiana purchase moment what happened there was we uh the overton windows shift now it it it's possible to discuss nation states holding bitcoin on the balance sheet and if nation states are going to buy it then it's reasonable for institutions corporations and individuals to buy it as well so that was tremendous

Title: Alger's Crawford on big tech rebound attempt from $1 trillion wipeout: Much worry about nothing
Transcript:
we'll see if it can hold these  levels. i'll send things back over to  you  >> keeping a close eye, thank  you. we'll stay with tech the group  trying to make a comeback from  what was pretty massive selloff, the mag seven down nearly 9%  since the start of the month. in the group as dom mentioned we keep an eye on shares of nvidia, down around 17% over the last 30 days. stock is a top name in several  of our next guest's funds. she tells us she's not worried  about the shakeup. portfolio manager. nice to have you here.  >> nice to be here.  >> microsoft and nvidia, amazon, apple, another fund, nvidia,  amazon, meta, apple and another  microsoft, nvidia, meta, apple,  alphabet, some of that in a  moment, but we heard from  earnings. nobody is pulling back on capex, but there is a larger question  among some investors as to  whether that will be well  invested and generate the  necessary returns. you believe it will? >> i do. and in part because if you look  at first of all, if you look at  just microsoft's azure numbers,  they went from being a zero  dollar business seven quarters  ago to having a $6 billion run  rate today. i would challenge anyone to tell me what other business grew from 0 to $6 billion in year and a  half and that is just the early, early innings of this ai trade. and so when they see the  opportunity, you know, this $6  billion business inside of two  years will be close to $20  billion in revenue. how much capex do you need? so, you know, the capex actually makes a lot of sense to me  because the demand that they are seeing and the pull that they  are seeing is significant. if you look at individual kind  of ideas of how and how  productivity will improve  because of ai, there are so many different examples. we just talked to a pharma  company who saved $70 million  because they started to use  chatgpt to help them formulate  kind of the packaging that  plastics were in. that's an almost infinite roi  for them. we think they're very early on  and we have to remember chatgpt  kind of exploded on to the scene less than two years ago. and it's already on pace to make significant changes to  productivity.  >> right.  >> i don't know. i think there's like a much  worry about nothing. in part because i don't think  people believe the productivity  increases, but we do.  >> it may be time to see that. these stocks had an enormous run until recently and the p/e  ratios now differ somewhat. i note you have them all in your portfolio, so are you not that  worried about some that may be  trading at higher multiples than others in terms of at least the  underlying earnings growth? >> i mean i would say for a  majority of them, albeit not  apple, that the p/e ratios are  actually quite interesting, and  i mean you look at -- when  people talk --  >> interesting means what? sorry. >> they're not actually that  highly valued because when you  are at the beginning of a cycles significant as this you cannot  look at the next 12 months in  earnings. you have to look out and say  what is the earnings power of  this business in a fully  blossomed state. even if you look out to 2026,  microsoft in our opinion trades  at kind of a 20 to 22 times  multiple on earnings. today meta trades at a submarket multiple. so to us that does

caterpillar had good earnings. atlanta fed 2.9% growth. it feels like the market, steph, had one giant economic panic  attack yesterday. you must view it that way  because you bought more bank of  america and truist. >> we talked about eaton and lam research. it was a growth scare on friday  for sure. and we're not out of the woods. volatility is here. we have three inflation reports  for the september meeting with  the fed in jackson hole. the important thing to think  about is what is the economy  doing? it's growing 2, 2.5%. and that's a really important  point. i look at the consumer, we all  look at the consumer because  it's super important, and there  are tail winds. >> is that what it's about,  because your belief in the tail  winds you're talking about? >> gasoline prices are down 10%  in the past year. mortgage rates are the lowest  since april of 2023. inflation is at 2.5%. growing the economy 2, 2.5%. that's good. why am i buying the banks.

mostly sitting out the pbroader  market rebound, fwoog held an  illegal monopoly. deirdre bosa has more on what  comes next in today's "tech  check." hi, dee. >> it does not usually move the  needle. enforcers are too slow, they  can't win cases, arguments that  let bulls be complacent in the  face of rising scrutiny. yesterday's ruling could be an  inflection point. it showed that 20-plus years  after microsoft's landmark case  the department of justice can  successfully bring a m monopolization case against big  tech and that will be in the  back of the others' minds,  apple, amazon and meta, and even a second ad tech case against  google that goes to court this  fall. so what comes next in terms of  remedies? that will be just as critical  especially for google and apple, mind you, which, remember, gets  $20 billion in payment for  giving google default search  position on devices. one of apple's most lucrative  business arrangements. the key question whether the  remedy handed down will be  structural or operational. a structural remedy would seek  to break up or divest part of  the business. operational remedy might force  apple and others to offer google search on a search choice screen like they do in the eu. jonathan cantor on cnbc today  wouldn't say which one he was  pushing for but did say this. >> right now is perhaps the most critical inflection point in the search market in 15 years and  making sure it has the  opportunity, that competitors  have the opportunity to compete  on the merits, benefit of their  own innovations and win or lose  based on the product is most  important. >> canter kanter is talking  about generative a.i. that could disrupt google. perplexity and openai is trying  to challenge the company's  dominance. kanter talked about his recent  trip to the bay area, spent time with vcs and founders and said  he found overwhelming support  for his and the ftc's tech  cases. as much as wall street dislikes  the current regulatory  environment as a whole, there is a powerful and increasingly  vocal group here in silicon  valley that does back them.  >> it's a good point, dee. the last time i checked, apple  shares were actually down lower  than alphabet shares today on  this news. in addition to the openais of  the world, microsoft has been  trying to take the littlest bit  of market share on the search  side. do we know who the other  beneficiaries could be? what are the lessons we've  learned from europe? >> there's skepticism even if  there was a choice, consumers  would choose anything other than google, and that was the crux of the argument throughout the  entire case. they provide the best choose and users want to use them. the reason why apple may be down on this and the ramifications  could hit apple hardest, it gets that $20 billion payment, $20  billion in 2022, from google,  and that makes up a significant  portion of its services. one of its most lucrative  agreements. one analyst note said that could result in a 4% to 6% hit to epf  in the future. that's certainly not  insignificant. there's skepticism that will  come to fruition. remember as well that google is  going to appeal this. this is still going to take a  long time, all the while the  field is changing drastically  with

Title: Trade Tracker: Rob Sechan buys Nvidia and sells O'Reilly Auto
Transcript:
worst moment, that's probably  not too far away from the worst  moment we're going to see in the next couple of months. >> there are members of our  investment committee who are  making moves or use the -- if  you want to use the word  dislocation yesterday to add to  positions or establish new ones. rob sechan joins us of new edge. we had many conversations over  these months about not being in  nvidia. you owned a lot of different  tech names, but this is the one  that you didn't. but now you do. tell me why. >> so, scott, when we looked at  our portfolio, this is a  portfolio that benches against  the russell 1000 growth. the average stock was up 5%. our average stock was up 15. and yet the index was up 21. all that performance, all that  underperformance was due to not  owning nvidia. so it raises the questions on  how you're building portfolios  that are supposed to act a  certain way within client  accounts and make sure that  you're not taking that what we  call tracking error or active  risk. what happened yesterday after  being underweight the stock for  a long time, we looked through  our portfolio. we saw a stock like o'reilly,  which is still a high-quality  business. they've generated attractive  returns. a lot of defensive  characteristics, but they were  trading at a high p/e relative  to their history, and they were  seeing same store sales start to slow. so we looked to that position to move into nvidia and effectively with our portfolio upgrading  quality capitalizing on a recent valuation reset, reducing our  tech underweight, reducing our  tracking error and active risk,  and given that they're going to  have earnings made sense. we still think there's risk in  the short run whether it's  because of the unwind, because  of this move in interest rates,  whether it's because we have  more jobs data coming out that  may scare markets, we do think  you could have an opportunity to buy more at lower levels. when you see volatility, you  can't just think about from a  macro standpoint, what you're  going to do. you have to be surgical, be  micro, and i would envision in  all our portfolios we run, five  different strategies, you're  going to see changes if this  volatility persists in upgrading the quality. i don't think any of us knows  right now if this is a welcome  cooling or an unwelcome growth  scare. if it is the latter, we will  have plenty of opportunity. and the key is preparing clients to do things. let me tell you another thing we did that you might find  interesting. a month ago we were long  duration. never have i seen a move in  bonds the way we've seen a move  in bonds here and we've closed  that out and even shortening  duration because it's become  much less attractive. to rick rieder's point, to  everyone on the committee's  point, there is a ton to do, and volatility creates opportunity  if you're prepared

bring in show music please this is squawk pod from cnbc i'm producer cameron costa and on today's episode making sense of the markets it's not not a turnaround after a huge market selloff we don't know what the front end of a recession looks like and we don't know if that's what this is and it may not be author of black swan nasim taleb how he's thinking through the plunge the fed and our bigger economic issues the problem is not the drop in the market the problem is the structure what we have everyone knows we have a lot of debt and nobody's doing anything about it and google has lost an historic antitrust battle how the decision affects the rest of silicon valley and whether it even matters to the public if google has a monopoly on search former sec chair jay clayton that's something that the judge has to deal with the fact that consumers may just like this plus kamla harris now the official democratic presidential nominee and she's got a running mate minnesota governor tim walls beat out pennsylvania governor josh shapiro shapiro would certainly make her look like she's trying to le more moderate wall is more progressive it's tuesday august 6th and squawk pod begins right now stand anderby in 3 2 1 q ander good morning and welcome to squawkbox right here on cnbc we're live with the nasdaq market site in times square man ross sorin along with joe kernin becky's off today it's day two of this volatile market week and it's not quite a turnaround but it is a lot better than the carnage that kicked off the week on monday the dow lost more than a, points before market open on tuesday the dow was down over 5% in just the last three sessions the s&p 500 down 6% over the same time span down more than 8% from its record high and the tech heavy nasdaq landed firmly in correction territory heading into tuesday session it was down more than 133% from its recent all-time high last week the nasdaq fell 3.4% closing out its worst 3-we stretch in 2 years and then it lost another 3.4% on monday amazon alphabet and microsoft raised a few concerns in their latest financial reports an apple stock 5% after berkshire hathway disclosed that warren buffett slashed his stake in the company by nearly half let's get back to joe and andrew overnight a big rebound which might be helping what we're seeing in the futures this morning in tokyo the n gaining just over 10% that's its largest daily gain since the october since october of 2008 after having its worst day since 1987 the day before uh monday the n losing more than 12% and we talked about the crash of 87 uh over there if you remember we had our own crash i was watching i was there holding client's hands is not a great day and then an earthquake was like a week later uh in los angeles but uh turnaround in japan i don't know if i'd call it a turnaround tuesday here we'll see whether it question are we stabilizing i know maybe it's a stabilized tuesday it's a turnaround tuesday in uh in japan if if you rebound from down 12 to up 10 so the thing was look it seems like that was just a carry trade that got on round and that might be the question is is it that or was it something else and then the mechanics of the system did seem to work for the most part minus some of these um you know online systems that seem to fail that's a whole different issue but what causes the carry trade to go away is the underlying problem that everybody's worried about the question is the underlying problem the a confidence problem in the jobs the growth of the country problem we don't know what the front end of a recession looks like and that's the question but and we don't know if that's what this is and it may not be that's where i was going with it it may not be it may not be or it might be but if it is you want out and you know warren he doesn't like to sit around in stocks that go down he just doesn't he's got a lot left obviously but that was a pretty uh i would say that that's indicative of someone that doesn't feel so i actually think the warren piece was a bigger piece than people giving it credit for i think that was weighing on people's confidence yesterday if believe if you believe he still got it which he i'm sure he does cuz he's been doing it for so long and and he definitely he can either hold a lot of equity a lot of stock or he can loosen up and selling half of your apple is is definitely i will say this and i think he would say this as he's gotten older he's become even more and more and more conservative about things probably that happened during the pandemic and everything else check this out though because i think this is going to have a huge impact um ultimately on potentially alphabet but maybe even more broadly uh the rest of silicon valley shares of alphabet this morning um they're actually up marginally the mega cap stock getting caught up uh in the selloff then more news late in the day and it is this a federal judge ruling that google had illegally held a monopoly in two market areas search and text advertising it is a landmark case from the government it was filed back in 2020 it alleged that google had kept a shair of the general search market by creating strong barriers to entry and a feedback loop that sustained its dominance now the court found that google violated what's called section two of the sherman act it effectively outlaws monopolies the ruling marking the first anti-monopoly decision against a tech company in decades and what we don't know is effectively how the judge is going to rule in terms of what is the remedy is there a behavioral remedy is there a breakup remedy it what what does that even mean we've talked for a long time about the fact that they pay these guys apple so there's there can be knockon effects they pay apple an enormous amount of money for the right to effectively be the default search do they say no moss we can't allow that anymore can you not sell other things like that google says it the judge found that it's the best search engine i know so okay it is the best what what court are we talking about and how many how many where do we go from here in terms of of appeals this is going to go on for years that's what i mean because to me it just looked like okay let's say you get i don't know who appointed this judge i don't know anything about him his his uh what he's how he's ruled before um is he a normal pro business type person is he someone who who is maybe way left doesn't like business doesn't like monopolies doesn't like you know so it that it's just weird to me that one guy or or or or lady that's why there's a system and then you go to so what's next and then are there there's at least one more and then eventually you figure the supreme court right you could go to the supreme court right and it's going to take a while but it isn't it weird to you that this is the way we do things that if one guy has an axe to grind he can basically throw wrench in the works of one of the greatest companies ever to come out of of silicon valley would you prefer to have a jury trial maybe not i prefer to what do you i would prefer to take it to the next guy who may have been appointed by a republican i don't know i don't know whether this guy was i don't think it should be about i i mean look i think there's going to be in the same okay hold on if you're if you willing to concede that hold on if you are willing to concede that these judges are political yeah then you should also be willing to concede when i've arguments around the supreme that it's very complicated and the fact that the supreme court is now um as stacked as it is that is admitting it's political i just wish it was the other side that decided on this one see i i i i'm biased in favor of of letting you know we always are i think lena khan's out of her mind and i'm biased for letting things sort out i think l khan's out of her mind i think lena khan is trying to look at the antitrust system in a way that's different than it has been looked at in the last 30 30 years but not in the last 100 years but on both sides and the question is whether very controversial figure very very controversial i i i don't know whether it's good or bad for business and commerce in the united states how how she's ring and the same thing goes with this i'm not sure that i i have a sort of i'm predisposed to think to let these things fall where they may we got great companies let them operate to me the thing is that there's we're fighting i mean the government is fighting a you know yesterday's war because the truth is that now that you have open ai doing their own search product and you have perplexity doing a search product and all of these guys who everyone thought that nobody could emerge it now appears that actually they can emerge so this is this might be like everything a fight that that should have happened if it was going to happen a long time ago kamla harris is now officially the democratic presidential nominee and after our show wrapped its broadcast today she announced her run mate in the last 24 hours vp harris had narrowed it down to two governors pennsylvania's josh shapiro and minnesota's tim walls she chose tim walls but there are major differences between those two choices and the walls pick tells us a lot about her campaign and her policy strategy before the news broke cnbc's megan cassella swung by the nasdaq set to join joe and andrew together they broke down the pros and cons of each option for different voter dem graphics these are two men who are sort of on opposite sides of the democratic spectrum governor tim walls campaigned as a moderate but then once he had a democratic legislature in minnesota we were just talking through some of this he started endorsing a lot of progressive policies and getting a lot of things done it was a billion dollars for affordable housing it was tax credits for low-income parents a lot of spending on child care free school meals and then beyond economic policy it was sort of a progressive policy laboratory in minnesota over the free college free college tuition for some people some some credits as well yeah ways to make it more affordable so he's definitely on that progressive side of the spectrum josh shapiro governor of pennsylvania much more moderate um did things like he's trying to slash corporate taxes in pennsylvania cut red tape he wants to pull businesses in there he's sort of been friendly with the oil and gas industry as governor um so when she's looking at this ticket she's looking at who will help her electorally and if she's focused on where these policy agendas are going to go shapira would certainly make her look like she's trying to lean more moderate wall's more progressive if i could guarantee pennsylvania and give the perception that i was moving to the center which everyone thinks she should do i mean she has said she's going to ban fracking he obviously didn't like that he didn't even like the lng uh legislation i think so he's on he's on the record for me uh it would be an easy an easy choice i would not move i because i wouldn't pick uh bernie's guy i would not pick bernie yeah if it was shapiro who sounds like you you think is it's going to be him and that no i'm not saying i'd like it i in fact i i worry because i think he'd be more formidable than waltz right because you want you want well i don't know who i my point is it's not like if we if shapiro was selected you're changing your i'm telling you no i'm telling you no no i'm telling you i'm telling you the right probably fears shapiro more than waltz i just think objectively you can say that if she does want to try to win her past positions have been way too far left and out of the mainstream and you can get the criticism she's a san francisco liberal if i were if i were whoever you're not voting for david plof uh i voted for jimmy carter okay i have voted for a democrat all right um if it's if david pl once uh i mean jimmy carter david plof this is not based on this is not like when i wanted joe biden to st this is not the same thing i'm honestly telling you that if i were so now you're admitting that when you wanted jo to stay in absolutely that's the most poorly kept secret in the world why everyone wanted joe biden to stay in my god i mean you you put kamla harrison the most unpopular vice president in history and she's suddenly a rockar the greatest politician ever yeah someone besides biden was what the left what democrats needed there was a lot of thinking that shapiro would pull these moderates to the ticket but to andrew's point there aren't a lot of republicans who support trump who would change their vote no matter what they they never would have so it's just the independence and i do think they think that walls has some endearing qualities he's from the midwest he's he grew up um you know out there he's got this former teacher world background former school teacher he's a hunter a gun owner even though he has also expanded some gun restrictions he's sort of done this from this common sense approach and he has this sort of folksy plain spoken way of speaking and so people think you know he shows up in his baseball cap at a school you have influence that might win folks over fight his record move to the center if you have any influence with anybody um you know the bat i thought you would think of moving to the center is bad for for for trump it is i'm telling you tell i'm being honest with you this is what if you want if you're comm harrison you want a shot here and you really do want to she needs to move to the center you've read her position she wants to get rid of ice she wants to defund the police she wants to ban fracking she does not want these things that you're saying she wants to do she does not want to do she does not want to defund she has said that in the past you've seen the videos hav you you se i have seen the videos you have seen video the problem is the people slice and dice these videos in 100 different ways there are things that she has said by the way i absolutely agree you go back and you look i can i'm glad you do because there's no those things up clean them up those are the things those are the things she beli in you don't have to clean there's a lot of people that believe in those things she's moved quite to the center since she start i haven't heard her say anything cuz she hasn't answered any questions from anyone she hasn't done anything off a teleprompter that's not true i interviewed her last year for an hour talking about since she became the nominee she's only been the nominee well the nominee for about 12 hours but the in the race she we know for 16 days and she hasn't done anything extemporaneously nothing yet so we'll see we'll see how all that plays out and we'll see if she really hit we'll see what she says about tracking now what what were some of the other things she universal healthcare you've seen that no no more private insurance se it's all on the record it's not made up i agree and the question is when she chang changes her view and she goes to the center you're going to say she's a flip-flopper so let's just see how it all goes keys will be next coming up making sense of the market's moves and global economic risks with black swan author and mathematical statistician nim tb once you raise rates you got to pay back for all your sins die is cast 30 years of sins there's no such thing that's free money squawk pod we'll be right back you're listening to squawk pod from cnbc today with joe kernin and inra ross sorin up and andrew q joining us right now on the set here to talk about the market selloff over the last few days is a special guest nim tob distinguished scientific adviser at university investments and of course the author of the black swan it's great to see you i think we're all trying to understand whether what we saw yesterday was the beginning of a black swan or not okay so first yes yesterday i got this uh call from uh my long-term business partner mark spitznagle 25 years of working with stale events he said this black swan and was the first of all the probability of not having a down 3% day okay the probability of not having one is what you got to consider 1.3% of time and and and almost most years the majority of years have a 3% down down so it's what is the black last week and the nik though the n down the n the n is a different situation and and let's talk about it separ but let me finish here what's the black swan very large impactful deviation that was not large nor particularly impactful and to completely outside the realm of expectation this is the absence of one a of the of the 3% or more drop in in in a 2ear period is is a black swarm what is this portend in your mind and and are you anxious at all or or or should we be worried i think there's a lot of questions about have to be worri about a bunch of things we have to be worried but but but but and now let's talk about the nik we have japan they did zero interest rate policy near zero interest rate uh uh you know po and then uh they had the the quantitative easing 23 years quantity of eating 30 years of near zero interest rates okay and a lot of people who thought that this method all right would help things you know stabilize thought they were vindicated right and now they realize that once you raise rates you got to pay back for all your sins the die is cast 30 years of sins yep you got to pay for so really i mean there's no such thing as free money yeah you cannot not cure a structural problem with a monetary policy no more that can you can cure cancer with a painkiller you see it's a pain killer you're going to put at some point it's going to we well off so this is so we have a problem and that problem is debt the first time we got on cc we started talking about that you and i 15 years ago probably on cnbc or elsewhere so this problem is that and let's see where it matters japan has a lot of debt no growth that's the problem okay and then they patching it up that's what you have have to handle and then of course a population problem an aging problem which worsens it so you have europe less deb but no growth right okay last 15 years sideways right that's a problem the us but the same a little more that than europe depends on a country some grow okay right and then of course china debt a lot of growth okay in in both cases though they slow down and everything but it's still ahead of so so here are the worst case of course is japan you don't want to be japan so it will drag us of course because we're all connected japan may be less connected than uh europe to us economy less impactful but still so we have a problem but now we have to worry about the debt the debt how can it crippers you realize that once we had to raise rates we start having the bills and then you pay interest on interest and now what percentage of the budget is deb servicing right it's growing right okay be the line i guess what so that's scary yeah that is scary so we have to worry about that so there's so long that this hangs over us okay we got a problem okay and this going to cause turmoil there'd be winners there'd be losers but that's the source of fragility in the system that is like staring at us and and people don't talk about it okay so what would you do about that let's say you're the head of the federal reserve you're j powell to the extent you have a lever what do you do the thing is it's not just j po j powell only he has a monetary policy in his hands he can't do some anything else okay that's his monetary policy to so we have a you need to balance the budget okay you got to find ways to balance the budget it's not his job and the problem is every time you have you know people run for they talk about balanced budget and guess what we're going away from balanc budgets the republicans create deficits the democrats create deficit you got that's the problem the politic everybody says growth is the answer everybody says growth is the only way out and is ai how about ai how about how about technology that's in the future ai okay that's like are you a believer because the other thing we watched nvidia stock and apple stock and google stock you know everybody has gotten hit in in the past couple of days where there's you know goldman sachs came out with a report suggesting maybe we actually are in some kind of ai bubble the thing is there there's a difficulty here and let me tell you the difficulty like people talk about nvidia right and it is you know they say well you know look how well it's doing a lot of the rally in the s&p is caused by that stock about what a little more than a third yeah r from the stock and it's but i don't know if you have a basement where you dump your old computers but go look at the the brands the the the first portable computer was osborne and went bankrupt okay the first google not the first source engine that's we had alav vista alav vista forgot that you know it's like in the cemetery of of ideas so we have a a a situation here where people focus on a company because so ai will win mhm it may help grow i don't know if it will help grow or not i don't know yeah mean you can't really speculate but ai definitely is has a lot of uses but let me tell you but it's not necessarily all right those companies that are doing ai today that will win we saw car companies how we know when the reckoning that we're not doing with debt becomes a problem and that's why people worry about things that that happened yesterday cuz you know how dogs can tell when there's an earthquake coming aren't there pre shocks or something how do we know this isn't the beginning of something yesterday how do you know we're not at the front of you just don't think i first first of all the the you got you got to treat the situation uh as a u you can't say you can't really make pro you got to say the the the risk is there at all time i' like okay and what happen is a catalyst yeah okay can happen just a catalyst and catalyst is not a cause all right so the the you will pro you need days like yesterday to trigger a bigger one right but it's the problem is not the drop in the market the problem is the structure what we have okay we everyone knows we have a lot of debt and nobody's doing anything about it and it's accumulating now about 120 130% of gdp is starting to be a problem yeah so but by the way i have something i want to mention yes i want to talk about bitcoin that's where i'm going to go what they don't point at me it's a speculative thing and one point is bitcoin pro once again yeah that it's not a hedge against your assets melting what or against money printing or it's just a speculative asset it's like a nasda it's a speculative asset that that seems to uh yeah just like i mean behave you're like high price real estate in in in manhattan to track the stock market right that that may be true but you're losing your ass from when you told me it was useless at 30,000 i'm saying it's useless doesn't mean you know there a lot of a lot of things i didn't invest in a lot of thing i didn't invest in that went went down instead of just talking i want you to short it or buy it do one or the other point is that's exactly the kind of false economy that you're causing i'm telling you it's an asset that's crazy okay got got enough crazy people to drive it up do you think that one what do you think going to happen to long term though i have no idea first of all it's i have no i mean i have no idea it's a speculative asset what i'm saying it's not useful in economic system to have assets that go from $10 to $660,000 okay when we're looking for price stability like netc that goes from 800 but that there's an underlying company that actually produces something that makes a product on any given day whatever it's worth is totally ephemeral you have no idea problem let me tell the problem bitcoin people they always went from $6 to $400 it's revolutionizing the world who knows whether bitcoin's doing that or not about people that think bitcoin not people that think it is who who how so it's become a speculative asset that's what it is that's the is being a a functional use in terms of what constitutes a a like actual money it has a fun that's exactly that's exactly that you're getting wrong it's proving that it's it can be anything but it's not a currency and it's not a hedge all right so treat it as a listen a lot of people buy pain what are the character what are the characteristics of of for example of gold it's immutable it's it's crosscultural there a limited supply there's all these different it it has a lot of those characteristic a property that bitcoin doesn't have to make jewelry no no let me first of all it has use as jewelry but there's one property is that if if you put okay i has a gold chain if you put it on the ground for 10,000 years it will still be gold bitcoin if if the the you know the players in bitcoin uh right if you if you unplug the servers you can own it you can still have it you don't need a server no keep being maintained okay i and and and and this is complicated well the entire world is based on something being plugged in at gold is gold is not and gold held its value it was stable up until the hunt okay and until of 73 when when no but go to stable it's worth about what a barrel it's it's worth a like a suit it's worth a good suit apparently over the years you can buy good suit of clothes for whatever gold cost but but but okay the idea of uh taking the story of gold and no the characteristics about six or seven characteristics that that that bitcoin shares with gold and i mean when when i first argument is not going to i've argu in the old days if you lived on an island if you did an hour of work and somebody else and you did one thing and somebody else did another thing you need a way to keep track of your work it's a distributed ledger which does that so it looks like uh the we're not going to go anywhere it is it is the world actually you're you're kind of left in the dust so we're coming around how many bitcoin have you used today to buy newspaper your coffee and uh okay now you're using the use basis now you've moved from the the the i am saying it's proving not to be a currency and i'm improving and it doesn't have the same attribute as gold as reserve of value so maybe something else i'm not complaining a lot of people like crazy stuff okay it's different it's not a petness don't make it a uh well it's not well in hindsight we'll see cuz you've up to this point you don't admit that you've miscalculated on on bitcoin you still think you're right i need i know people who hated at 5,000 that still think they're right and they'll go to their grave listen let me tell you i myself told you about three or four visits is it going to zero no i myself told you i told you it should based on what you're saying million it would still be expect that's you know that's bra that's brave for you to say then short it okay short it if it's going to zero buy if it we got to run this is a debate that will continue as we know nim thank you for coming in this morning thank you thank you next on squawk pod taking a deeper look at the anti-trust case against google whether the search giant is a monopoly and whether it matters with former sec chair jay clayton i think it's fantastic that in america we have four companies that are throwing tons of capital and sprinting at this and i should be really happy about i'd be worried if it was one company welcome back to squawk pod you're watching squawkbox on cnbc i'm joe kernin along with andrew ross storin becky uh is off to day join us now to discuss the recent market volatility the fed and more let's welcome former sec chair jay clayton he is now non-executive chair at apollo uh and a cnbc contributor where do you you want to start you come when when you come in we always have like a kind of a buffet of thing i don't know if there's a sneeze tray i don't like buffets without sneeze trays you know what i'm saying on top or sneeze shield but fair enough yeah where what's when the last three days what have you said oh my god i need to talk about this with with uh joe and andrew anything uh market function yesterday how was it wasn't great was it no i think but it worked i think it worked and and given that you had clearly a ton of force selling people people were selling because they because they had margin calls because they had to fund things they and and with that globally the market function function well um i think that that is that is good news what what else is good news our gbs what we worried about in 2008 and the like you know clearly this was this was nothing to them they they can handle market volatility like this you know you talk you talk to you know the largest banks this was not a problem for them um you know so those those are those are very good things um one thing that we're hearing this morning hearing on on this program um is the fed you know people are saying what should the fed be doing what my my takeaway is thank goodness we have an independent fed right you have all of these different pushes and pulls and the like and in a political season we're less than 100 days away from an election you know i think what you're what you're seeing why have the even the possibility of it not being independent and we were just talking about that why not have a tailor rule why not have a rules based fed instead of someone who who could be swayed someone who flies by the seat of the pants we had someone thinks you know green span was this vulker was this janet yellen was this banki was this we wouldn't have to it wouldn't have to be dependent on one person leading 12 11 or 12 other people around why not rul i i i don't think it's one person i think you know j pal chair pal a consensus does a pretty good job of build consens you know but maybe they follow along because because they find a good spot but the um why not have a rule yeah because the world changes the world the the financial world is very complex i mean why have a rule when you have what i would say is discipline fiscal spending and now i'm going out on a limb as opposed to proplate fiscal spending that's a that's probably it's probably a different context st zero and completely enabled the the fiscal spending but now they' now they've responded yeah and we we're we're in the middle of responding we don't know how it's i'm i'm i'm going to i'm going to defend the fed here we we're all looking to the fed to deal with this situation with the very blunt tool of of interest rates right when we have you know tr unprecedented fiscal spending right we have unprecedented supply shocks we have volatility around the world we have europe which is do you think we would have had unprecedented fiscal spending if they had that that's not their place their place is whatever congress does they fund it they they they shouldn't try to to tight to cut off the spigot i think that unfortunately you know they they're they're in reactionary mode as a as as it goes to fiscal spending that's that's where they've always been that's how you stay independent can we talk let's let's talk about uh you can talk about google i might my point was it it's just weird and i don't know we we're finding out who appointed the judge i'm not really going to say one way or the other what that that it's political but it's one person that's deciding on on on i don't know whether i know but but then there there's also by the way i disagree often times with judges and then you go to and what about this one you think google is really good at what it does or do you think it monop i'll start with that yeah um when it's not the i'll just speak personally when it's not the browser that comes up i switch to it because my experience is it's just better yeah you know so okay and that's that's something that the judge has to deal with the fact that consumers may just like this um what i thought i thought was good about the opinion i perused it quickly is the judge did explain the thinking right in a pretty clear way i think in these types of situations what does the what does the judge owe the the parties and what do they owe the appel at court as much of a balanced view of how they viewed the law and the facts so that the public can react the appell at court can look at it and like what's next i mean is it a good precedent or a bad precedent for for our tech industry which is the best in the world i i am all in on tech i'm all in on tech all in on america it's one of our greatest advantages i think we have to be pretty careful about whether touch light touch we're not getting here's my question my question is are have we are they fighting yesterday's war which is to say that google has been the predominant you know search engine in the world but now all of a sudden we're talking about perplexity we're talking about open ai doing its own search product um all of a sudden microsoft which is you know partnered with open ai is is making a new run at making bing you know a meaningful player i i don't know if any of those things are going to succeed but you know if you look over 10 20 30 years at the top 10 companies in america in terms of market cap uh and revenue they do switch they switch they switch and that's something to be said about competition in innovation is a much better response than the government to these types of situations so having said that is right it's absolutely clear having said that i and look and and people would argue oh but the government needs to be there to foster innovation right okay back to joe's point light touch forward looking so here's the complicated part i say to myself if i'm apple i should absolutely be able to sell parts of my screen to whoever i want okay 100% okay in this case they sell it to google mh because they sold it to google google has and because they sold for a lot of money by the way not everybody has the can afford the the screen space if you will so the capital if you will all of a sudden has competitive value yeah so they get on this screen and there's a feedback loop and that's the part that i think we haven't really thought through from a competitive land uh perspective i don't think this is that new what brand does macy's put in the store front window they absolutely no no but here's the question what product do you know that gets put in the macy's window and the product gets better because it's in the window so the reason that the google product the network effects is because more people are using it and therefore it can train effectively better to actually um send people to the right place in a way frankly that some of these others can't so so right and that's a very interesting dynamic is apple supposed to say i'm sorry i can't i can't i can't put you i agree with you because it's too good a deal i've always defended apple's right to do that but then the question is does google not have the right to pay the money it's a very interesting sort of philosophical but not also philosophical very practical issue from an anti you know just if you're antitrust this one actually is closer to me um in terms of like thinking through the sort of unique dynamics at play than some of the others i i i get it because and when you are in a government position like that high impact is something you always have to look at and sure it's a it's a greater impact but what does the consumer want and then the question is what's the what is the remedy do you believe in behavioral remedies i as a consumer love the search engine because it's so darn good right so and it's so darn good because so many people use it do you believe in behavioral remedies um meaning that somehow the government oversees some part of the company as a result of a ruling like this if they were to continue to lose in an appeals court or do you uh subscribe to the philosophy that you need to break things up or split things off to to to serve the greater good so back back to what what you asked we have this ai revolution that is forecast that's where the government should be looking are people somehow taking what they have today and in the next step using their power today to segregate i'm surprised you say that cuz i would take the opposite side i would say right now ai is so early still g still in the game that i want all of these guys to be sprinting as hard as they can and the second that i put up a hurdle in front of them in any way i'm i'm slowing down the no that's what that that's that's what i'm saying we let's look at that market we've had this conversation i think it's f fantastic that in america we have four companies that are throwing tons of capital and sprinting at this and i should be really happy about i'd be worried if it was one company you're very woke are you worried that they're all the same companies though that's one of the things to think about you're very you're very you're woke can be good woke can be eyes open can be eyes open so don't we're going to use that in a commercial for uh vice president harris yeah exactly wo can be very it can be a good thing for you i don't want you to take it wrong no whatever you want to call me what i call you well just whatever i want to call as long as i call you that's all you care about okay thank you than j that's the podcast for today thank you for tuning in our tv show

why? there were no expectations going into the bristol report. there were high expectations  going into organon. >> kntk, big dividend. tell me about this one. >> do you remember about a month ago end of the quarter when i  told you i sold exxon and was  wait to ing to replace it? this is the replacement. i owned pipe near and then exxon bought them. i don't want big diversified. i sold off exxon, started to buy kinetik at $41. it spiked up to $45. i waited and there's  opportunity, there are things to do. here is what kinetik is, a pure  play midstream company  concentrated in the permian  ba basin. it's not just pipelines. there's more commodity exposure  because it's things like storage and pipeline sales and gathering and processing so they get 35%  of their ebitda from pipeline  transportation. 99% of revenues are fee based or contracted. blackstone is a huge owner and  has a lot of seats onboard. they were started as a spac in  2017 and created to go in and  buy up distressed assets and put together a lovely midstream  energy package. so now you have a midstream  energy company. it's not an lp so no k-1. $4. 31 this year. $5 the year after that. i think you've got probably high single digit return in shares  that follows that free cash fl

Title: Small business sector is being overestimated by the BLS, says Ironsides Marcroeconomics' Barry Knapp
Transcript:
macroeconomics and cnbc senior  economics reporting steve  liesman is here with us as well. barry, not to dive into the  really intense question before  the simple one, but i can't help myself. what do you think is the mistake on the qt front? >> yes. in essence, by being passive qt, the bulk of the easing, and  april degreesive with rate hikes caused the deepest yield curve  inversion since paul volcker. that paul volcker yield curve  inversion, it never recovered. at that time it was 80% of the  supply of mortgage credit. this go-around they've put undue amounts of pressure on the small banks system and small  businesses so, in essence, the  small business sector had to  bear the brunt of the weakening  of demand that's arguably  contributed to the  disinflationary process. we've been expecting or viewed  small business and climate as  overestimated by the bls because of their infamous model for  something like 18 months now,  increasingly evidence. you can see it in the household  survey, the increase in the  unemployment rate. and it's now becoming clear the  way they conducted policy put  all this pressure on small  businesses, large businesses  were able to benefit from tight  credit spreads, borrowing, the  credit market, and this whole  thing has piled on itself and  we've finally reached the point  it's become systemic and we're  seeing real signs of weakening. >> let me try to translate what  barry is saying. if the fed had shrunk the  balance sheet a couple of years  ago, putting those securities  back in the market, instead of  ratcheting rates up to 5.5%,  small, medium sized businesses  might have survived better. i'm curious what your thoughts  are. this is playing the -- it's easy to look at it now and we have to debate going forward, but it's  an interesting point. >> yeah. a lot of respect for barry, as  always. i kind of think of qt like a  technical nuclear weapon. it makes a lot of sense in neary but nobody quite knows how it  works in practice. so i do know the fed was  reluctant to use it, use it as a tool. it wanted it to operate in the  background. it had bad experience with  overdoing it. it didn't know what the right  liquidity levels were. i would have to look more into  it. as i follow the adt small  business hiring, i didn't see  more on the hiring or the  rehiring on the small business  side though i could understand  some difficulty when it comes to the cost of credit and credit  standards for small business. that would have made it harder. they might have expanded more. i do think there's a really good discussion to be had the next  time the fed gets around the qt  which hopefully will be never. as to how and how much it relies upon which one of these two  levers, which is should it have  wound do

Title: Even if the economy slows, that's more of reason to buy into tech: Potomac Wealth's Mark Avallone
Transcript:
country. live on "the exchange." >>> turning back to the markets, the mega caps seeing the biggest losses. the 30 largest stocks in the s&p have collectively lost nearly  are $3 trillion in the past  couple weeks. for comparison. remaining 470 stocks lost about  a trillion and a half during rt  same time span. nvidia schhed more than 600  million. my next guest is buying the dip  in big tech. the president of potomac wealth  advisers, mark, i'm surprised. tell me. >> i don't know why you're  surprised. those are some of the best  companies in the world. yes, they were a bit overvalued  but look at the valuations today relative to last week. everyone was talking about a.i.  and technology and the  investments companies will need  to make in cloud and security  and everyone is worried about  tech. i think the move yesterday makes it healthier now to invest in  technology. we think even if the economy  slows, that's more of a reason  to buy into the growth trade, to buy in technology. companies cannot sit on the  sidelines and not invest in  those important areas. we think even a slowdown where  the growth is going to be and  where it's going to be  resilient. >> i joke about being surprised  but i think of you as a stock  picker, someone trying to look  through the momentum crowd and  focus on fundamentals and some  would argue big tech are the new consumer staples. plenty think the a.i. trade got  overdone and the valuations were too high. >> it may have. look at amazon, apple, meta, and plenty of other tech names broad base. we like broad base technology,  etfs, the more equal weight. people think they're buying  technology when they buy the  xlk. that's 45% in two names. and we think that's not a  prudent approach. we like a broader base. we don't want our clients to be  exposed to something like  crowdstrike which is down 40% in a month. i know it's fancy and sounds  great to throw out names and  pick them, unless you're deem on the inside, you don't know  what's around the corner and  crowdstrike is a great example  why we likebroad based, more  equal weight and not an  overweight into mega caps. >> that is a good point. do you think the market broadly  speaking is in a rotation, in a  defensive tilt? looking at lockheed, i saw you  were coming on today. i was reminded of your defense  picks. that was last year. curious how that fits into what  you think is going on in the  market if it does. >> one of the reasons we like  defense, graeat memory, you wan  things that don't run in the  same direction with, for  example, mega cap tech and  defense is going to run on its  own and, unfortunately, there  remains a need for this  globally. defense etf would be doing a lot better if they didn't include  boeing. if you take boeing out of the  big defense sector etfs, the  other main components such as a  raytheon, this has been a good  place to diversify away from  technology. that's why we liked it and why  we think investors should still  consider it. it giv

Title: Housing market 'will see a lot of refinancing' as mortgage rates drop, says Mr. Cooper Group CEO
Transcript:
it's great to have you here. >> thanks, kelly. good to be here. >> a lot of people are putting  their hopes in here maybe the  housing market can rise if the  rest of the economy falters. what do you think about that? >> i think if rates do fall and  continue to fall, you'll see a  lot of refinance. we had our biggest lock day on  friday and saturday, application day, than we've had in a year. if you look at our overall  portfolio, 20% has a rate higher than 6%. so we'll see what happens with  rates, but it certainly could  lead to a massive movement in  refinance. >> it's a confusing thing to  talk about because people think  the housing market has been  going up because prices have  gone up but activity itself has  been low because there's so  little inventory. if rates drop a little bit, do  you think we get inventory  coming back in the market? >> i do. i think you have a lot of people on the sidelines, to your point. they have the lower rate,  they're locked in, and they're  sitting on a ton of  appreciation. if rates come down, i think that will spur quite a bit of  activity on the purchase side. >> remind me, how much -- there  wasn't much purchase activity  going on in terms of the  business mix. >> yeah. no, look, in this market we're  focused on the services  business. the largest servicer in the  country. we service one out of ten  mortgages in the country, and  that has been tremendous. and we think about our business, to your point earlier, as a  balanced business model so we  can really succeed in any rate  environment. but servicing has really been  our focus in the last year, year and a half, as rates have  continued to increase. >> so you said you had a really  busy day on friday, the busiest  in a year. 6.5% mortgage rates really move  the needle? what would? >> i think you'll have to get  another 50 basis-point move to  really move the needle. again, if you look at our  portfolio and certainly we're  representative across the  country, we have about 20% that  is above that 6% rate. so for a customer to really get  a benefit, you're going to need  to see more movement before you  see a ton of activity. look, we'll see if the fed stays the course or if they make a  move. i think if that does happen,  you're going to see a lot of  activity. we've been investing in our  platform, if you look at what  we've tried to do over the past  couple of years, we've added a  lot of capacity. we've had a lot of team members  there. so we're ready if rates do  continue to move down. >> and do you have a view on  what would help push the spread  lower? i think it's about a half point  wider than usual, so we're not  getting the full benefit of  lower rates to lower mortgage  rates. we have this half-point spread. people say it's because of  regulation, because it's all in  the fed's balance sheets. there's a number of things to  sift through. do you have any idea what would  help on that front? >> no, i don't see it changing  anytime soon, to your point, for really all the factors

Title: Figs' big Olympic moment
Transcript:
explain the news what what what is the news so we're super excited we're the first company to ever outfit team usa's medical team um actually there's been no country in no medical team in any country has ever had a company outfit the medical team as one unified team so it's a really exciting thing healthc care professionals ensure that athletes perform at the top of their game uh score more goals you know get on top of that podium um and our company is focused on ensuring that the healthcare community gets a podium of their own so that's what this partnership is all about why is it taking so long to have something like this you know we asked that same question we said you know who outfits the medical team and they said we didn't we don't even know and so we said we would love to be that sponsor we would love to um kind of support the people that are taking care of the athletes and ensuring that they can do what they you know have done over this past week and a week plus so it's been a really exciting time um and you know more to come on this but it long time coming and it involves paris and milan yes and la it's all part of the same deal i think you know our whole goal is to support the medical team for you know we've been around for about 12 years and this is a huge milestone historic for the sports community for healthcare community and that coming together and so yes milan yes la and hopefully more to come post that right i wonder how you think about olympic sponsorships in general because you must have done the math on the return on this kind of thing we have seen some very big global sponsors in the past say okay we're done for now what what were what were the pros and cons do you think i mean i think it's just it is one of these moments where um the healthcare community has always been you know no one's really focused on them right and and they've dedicated their lives to serving other people and how do you showcase and put a spotlight on them at the on a global stage and there's no bigger global stage than paris the olympics and so it's really exciting uh to do that but no one had done it before there's no precedent so um you know there we don't really weigh the pros and cons it's more about how do we shine that spotlight um and give them the love that they deserve give them a podium of their own and so uh that's what we were excited that we were able to do here are you are there other global players that could potentially do this for other teams around the world i mean hopefully right medical professionals are you know they are 140 million healthc care professionals around the world they all deserve that spotlight given what they do every day and so hopefully that you know we have led the way and hopefully people will follow right um let's talk some broader business trends we just had a jobs number where it's clear that healthare is is just not it's so structural the trend in in the need for healthare aging demographics in the country talk about what that means for apparel in over the next say 5 to 10 years yeah i mean even with the shorter term trends that we're seeing even with today's news um i think healthc care jobs are the most important jobs and they're not going anywhere and it's the fastest growing job segment over the next 10 years um and so and you know we're here to support this community uh obviously with product and but also in other ways um and so i think um there's a huge shortage not just in the united states but globally for doctors and nurses and healthc care professionals they are the backbone of any functioning society they are not going anywhere and we need more of them and they're going to need stuff to wear and they need uniforms to do their jobs well they need to perform at their best just like athletes are performing at their best um you know 12 hours shifts 16 hour shifts running around a hospital uh saving lives helping patients curing diseases they are needed in society and we are the company that is showing up and supporting them so they could do that job and do it well are you seeing any changes in buying patterns or ordering trends we have seen and we we've talked about this about repeat frequency right how often are healthcare professionals coming back to replenish their uniform it's a replenishment driven industry and that trend has slowed down postco but we're actually seeing an uptick in the last quarter or so where that that trend is kind of uh reversing course um and so that co overhang is is going away and we're seeing positive trends uh despite the news that we see today right how about are what's the like level of innovation in this kind of work is it pretty standard has it always been sort of what it is and it always will be that or are there ways to tweak it i mean that was the problem right every scrubs were boxy ill-fitting uncomfortable scratchy and we changed the game and we brought function and fit and comfort and durability to this industry that never had it and so um there's more to come we work directly with team usa's medical team to develop the team usa collection um it's really awesome we have some we have some product here today and so we'll show that to you but um there's much more to come in terms of innovation fabrication with fit with functionality uh just like athletes need to perform at the top of their game so do healthcare were there things that they asked for specifically that you hadn't already thought of i mean yeah i mean what they're holding their stethoscope their uh their wraps their tapes their you know their ipads all these things that they need the pocketing architecture that we developed for this collection is pretty robust and so that's just one element of what they requested and how we built that into the product

Title: Earnings Exchange: Disney, Super Micro, & Rivian
Transcript:
kelly? >> double digit for many of the  plans. thanks, julia boorstin.  >>> disney is also one of the  stocks in today's earning  exchange along with super micro  and rivian. we'll start with disney, gina,  which reports with the stock  down 30% from its recent highs. analysts are keeping an eye on  the parks and cruisers,  subscriber growth, box office. do you like the stock here? >> so we do. we actually continue to hold  disney. it's been a long-term hold for  us. so when you look at disney and  what they've actually gone  through and what they're headed  into, it still remains a very  defensive stock. and we think that its valuation  is fair if not slightly  undervalued given the property,  the continued defensiveness of  its parks despite a consumer  slow down. and quite frankly, the streaming sector will offset kind of the  slowdown in cord cutting in  linear tv revenue. we think all in all the package  for disney is compelling and  continues to be compelling.  >> it's a good case to be made  for somewhat beaten up stock. what about super micro on that  note? lost more than half its value  after yesterday's sell-off. jp morgan remains bullish. robust cap-x in terms of the  demand expectations and look the partnership with rivian. what do you do with super micro. >> we also hold this one and  continuing to hold it. this is one i don't think you  wade into right now. i think there's a sentiment  shift that is happening. so if you've banked a lot of --  if you banked a lot of return,  then it's a different story than sort of wading in while the  markets are really choppy. the outlook for this stock is  tremendous. they are showing incredible  growth, but they're also, you  know, locking a little stretched in their valuation. relative to nvidia they look  fantastic. but relative to the rest of the  industry, they're still looking  stretched and it's why they got  beat up. we think that could continue as  the market continues to rerate.  >> and it's still doubled this  year, volatile as it is. what about ri vian, down nearly  40%? >> this is interesting. we think they could be a  potential buy. rivian is one that definitely  got beat up because it was not  profitable. and they have committed to a  path to profitability. i think what we're going to see  this earnings -- this quarter is that they are continuing to show that. they're continuing to deliver  and grow deliveries, quarter  over quarter and year over year. and they are also cutting their  costs. and effectively showing that  they can make profitability by  year end, which quite frankly  it's pretty much a requirement

Title: Tim Walz was the most 'do no harm' candidate, says Libby Cantrill on Harris' VP selection
Transcript:
kamala harris has selected tim  walz as her 2024 running mate. he served six terms in the u.s.  house of representatives and was elected governor in 2018. one of my next guests says he  falls into the do no harm  category and another says he was a terrible pick allaround. don peebles along with pimco's  head of public policy. i believe those not minced words were yours about the pick. you're a housing guy. isn't he the most pro-housing  guy on the planet? >> he should be neutral or value added. i think what they did here is  made a decision on identity  politics. the better choice would have  been wolf, whitmer or wes moore. all three didn't fit the optics  of what they wanted to pick. and so if you go into policy,  vice presidents don't set policy so it's irrelevant. the president of the united  states sets the policy. >> the last governor to be on a  winning ticket as vice president was andrew johnson in 1865. is that true? >> apparently, yes. according to the internet. hi, kelly. this is -- clearly, i'm talking  about of the candidates that she had sort of narrowed down the  selection process to. tim walz was the most sort of do no harm candidate. not many people know who he is. he is an athletic coach, a  geography teacher he was -- he  had a stint in the army. he's a pretty likeable guy. he was on the hill. both democrats and some  republicans even liked him. he had quite a more centrist  record on the hill,  interestingly, than when he  became governor. he sort of pivoted more to the  left. folks reading the tea leaves  about his policies more  centrist, again, on the hill. but as governor, particularly  when they won both chambers of  the state legislature became  increasingly progressive. >> wasn't pence the governor  when he won with trump, was he  governor at the time? >> yes, he was, the governor of  indiana. >> maybe this is a chatgpt, they don't have access to the recent  years. what are the implications for  the business community if any? >> i think from the business  community you have a moderate  dressed up as a moderate. what he's done in minnesota,  many of the policies have been  progressive. the vice president doesnot set  policy. kamala harris, if she's elected  president, will set policy. and so it's what her policies  are and what trump's policies  are. we've heard little from kamala  harris as to what her vision for america is in terms of economic  policy or foreign policy. i think we're going to need to  hear more of that, and that's  how the decision making process  will go, for those who have not  made a decision yet, and that's  a very small group of people. i think they were looking to  move some swing states here. wolfe would have been a better  choice. >> what do we turn our attention to? the convention is coming up. the debate sounds like it's not  going to happen? >> we don't know. i think that's to be determined. a presidential debate is  possible. president trump has suggested a  september 4 debate on fox news  and vice president harris said  she would stick to the september 10th on abc. this could be a singular debate, a monologue, if you will. i would agree that harris hasn't laid out her agenda. she almost has to run on a biden agenda. president biden is still the  president. to distinguish herself  dramatically on nip of these  policies really just isn't  practical, maybe marginally on  israel in particular. out-of-that we're telling our  clients to think she will have,  for all intents and purposes, a  biden agenda. everyone should just go to the  beach and have a glass of rose  and enjoy their august because  polling right now, particularly  through the convention, is just  not going to be very reliable. there's a harris honeymoon. a much better state of the race  in septemb

today the crypto market recovers from monday's steep sell-off bitcoin miner core scientific grows its partnership with ai company core weave again and as crypto markets continue their wild swings we speak to john woo of ava labs to find out where he thinks crypto is headed next welcome to cnbc's crypto world i'm brandon gomez crypto prices are staging a partial comeback after monday's big selloff

11% to $145 yesterday's selloff took place as crypto traders were caught in a storm of carry traders unwinding their positions raising concerns about a us economic recession escalating tensions abroad and increasing uncertainty about the outcome of the us presidential election crypto focused stocks like coinbase and micro strategy were in the red yesterday amid the crypto selloff and it seems like kathy woods arin vest took advantage of the lower prices as the firm bought nearly $18 million of coinbase shares and more than $1 million of robin hood shares as the market sank okay let's talk about the top stories for today micro strategies executive chairman michael sailor joined cnbc squawk on the street earlier this morning where he said that the recent crypto conference bitcoin 2024 4 marked

and that means we have some advantages over a trust company we've got permanent capital we can generate cash flows we've got operating flexibility um our shareholders want more bitcoin per share they think if we get more bitcoin per share that's creating shareholder value that means we're pursuing btc yield whenever we can uh do a capital markets transaction that's a creative and generates more bitcoin per share we'll do it we have uh we have uh the ability to sell equity into the market at a premium to net asset value we have the ability to issue convertible bonds we have the iss the abod to generate operating cash flow we're just going to keep uh generating more bitcoin per share any way we possibly can by selling the volatility of the asset class and then sweeping it into the underlying asset next the sec is pushing back on coinbase's demands for personal communications from chair gary gendler in a filing on monday the agency called coinbase's request breathtakingly broad because it sought essentially all the documents that in any way relate to crypto assets late last month coinbase filed a court document addressing the crypto exchanges subpoena of sec chair gary gendler and other discovery disputes the filing says that the exchange was unsuccessful in its many attempts made through june to collect documents from the agency that includes those related to coinbase's ipo and gendler's communications coinbase withdrew its request for gendler's pre-air communications narrowing its request in that filing now in this new filing today the sec says it already

main story let's turn our attention back to the markets crypto world's talia kaplan spoke with john woo the ceo of ava labs to find out where he expects crypto markets to head next as this volatile trading week continues we will also discuss his utility on the avalanche blockchain amid new government agency partnerships crypto markets were hit with a steep selloff to start the week following a sharp drop in financial markets around the world with many analysts saying heightened recession fears were to blame coupled with escalating tensions in the middle east at one point yesterday bitcoin was trading below $50,000 for the first time in six months now today bitcoin recovered some of yesterday's losses trading above $56,000 as of around noon eastern what do you think was behind yesterday's selloff and what does it signal to you about crypto sentiment right now hey talia well yesterday to sell off a lot of that is what you attributed to the macro environment um where it became a little bit choppy and bitcoin and the crypto asset class as a whole is very volatile there are also specific things related to bitcoin and the asset class that contributed to that selloff as well i would say um you know one of the great things about blockchain is the transparency so people saw that the us government have moved some a lot a large you know close to two billion dollars of bitcoin from one address to another that was an indication that they may sell on top of that um it was triggering leverage uh deleveraging on a lot of the asian exchanges so you saw that in a in a panic cell over the asia nighttime and then on top of that you just had this ethereum etf so you were coming off of that positive sentiment but at the same time there are ethereum trusts that have high cost structure so people naturally will sell that to go into a cheaper uh ethereum spot etf and that unfortunately happened during choppy markets so caused more selling now the recent drop in prices has eaten into bitcoin's gains for 2024 but it's important to note that the cryptocurrency is still in the green with bitcoin rising 32% since january as of midday what's your outlook for bitcoin in the coming months i heard you say in a recent interview that you can see bitcoin going well above $100,000 do you still feel that way with this week's selloff in the mix yes i i do i see the medium-term as being very very positive for bitcoin and the whole asset uh class if you will the first thing is i think morgan stanley just announced that they are now going to be able to allow their 15,000 wealth managers basically sell the fidelity and the black rock etf that's a new channel um frankly a lot of the bitcoin etf right now have been retail and some institutional but not really to the higher net worth ra channel that is fantastic and positive if you look at the coinbase earnings that we saw recently in terms of monthly users and other those streams of revenue you see that it's actually stabilized or actually growing nicely so users are not leaving the platform they stay they're staying there and they are more engaged and that's helping coinbase actually generate other revenue not just the the transactional revenue from from trades because trades weren't down in the last quarter or so so and then most important thing i think is you're seeing real use cases i'm at the the what they call bass the blockchain applications uh stanford summit and basically it's all about applications you have great academics here but you also have great um real world developers trying to create applications on the blockchain this is the first year that is by itself this used to be attached to another conference that's another indication that applications and utility are coming and if that's going to happen that that builds a well for the um the asset class in both the medium and long term and we're going to talk more about utility in just a bit but i heard you talk about the presidential candidates in that recent interview i referenced earlier noting that the republican nominee for president donald trump is pro business and pro-innovation he has come out recently as a crypto-friendly candidate in fact in may trump's campaign started accepting donations in crypto and of course the former president was the keynote speaker at bitcoin 2024 and nashville nearly two weeks ago we're also learning that camala harris's team is reaching out to crypto experts to learn more about the industry in fact speaking with us at bitcoin nashville congressman roana said he advised her team about digital assets how do you think crypto is starting to shape this election cycle and how much influence do you think it can have on the upcoming presidential election the oper echelons in the political world we know now recognize the community of crypto because the community of crypto is force um we' know these stats over 53 million americans actually own the crypto asset uh one of the you know part of the asset class either bitcoin or others and a lot of those are young voting americans so it's a big voting base on top of that the um uh the super pac associated with crypto actually uh raised over 207 million i believe that at the time when i last look was actually bigger than trump's make america great pack a little bit slightly bigger so that shows you that it's impactful for fundraising as well as actual votes and um you know it's great that trump spoke at nashville it's great that rana a democrat is also catalyzing hopefully um vice president harris's uh deeper study of it because it should be bipartisan it should be a bipartisan effort where both sides actually can help the community of crypto come to a fair u sensible standard so that everyone can develop that is a subject here at the uh blockchain applications conference at stanford where you know a lot of the applications that they people want to develop is somewhat dependent on uh removing uncertainty in the regulatory path now moving back to utility specifically on your blockchain last week we learned that the california dmv made history by leveraging blockchain technology to modernize vehicle title management the department has digitized 42 million car titles on avalanche in the first move like this in the us the project will allow california residents to claim their titles through an app using a verifiable credential can you take us through some of the benefits of this digitization of car titles well it's not just digit car titles anytime you have when you have many many people in a ecosystem many partners many people using it many rails if you will of information distribution and possibly also value exchange putting them on a database called the blockchain database where there's transparency better security and everyone can actually are plugged in interop the interoperability is better so there's that uh situation there's also many other situations putting ip on the chain that's another big subject especially in front of ai putting actually ip associated with creator's content and that's going to be very very important going into um ai as a adoption comes there's gaming companies trying to tokenize in-game assets and putting it on the chain these complex workflows are streamlined when you put it on a blockchain okay that's all we have for crypto world today we will be back here again tomorrow we'll see you then [music]

Title: The Fed needs to cut rates but not right now, says All Springs' Bryant VanCronkhite
Transcript:
that we need a cut and quickly. the difference is why they think we need it. on the one side, you have those  saying the rally is done. the recession is here. and the fed needs to make an  energy cut to prevent a further  slide. and on the other side, we hear  there is no recession, but the  fed needs to cut to keep the  rally going and ward off a  recession. here to discuss is brian van  kron cite, portfolio manager. brian, welcome. it's good to have you with us. i'm struck a little bit. and i don't know how long you've been calling for the fed to  reduce interest rates or not. but i'm struck that over the  past few months, while there was an undercurrent of people who  thought the fed needed to cut  and sooner rather than later, it was by no means the wide clamber that we're seeing in the past  couple of days. where everybody seems to be  saying, oh, the fed is behind  the curve. how could they possibly let this happen. i didn't hear that kind of  enthusiasm for a rate cut from,  let's say, february into june  and july. >> i think you're right. i personally been calling for  the fed to stay higher for  longer than most people have  been. i think that's the right move. inflation has been too high and  the fed is doing their job and  doing it very, very well. inflation is coming down. employment is becoming more  balanced. but we have to slow the economy  for that to happen. the fed is productively doing  their job. i think calling for emergency  rate cut right now would be the  same thing as the women's  national soccer team pulling  their goalie in the first half  of a nil-nil game. it might work. it might bring some offense, but it's very risky and we have to  call in credibility -- call into the question the credibility of  the decision makers here. the fed needs to cut rates  methodically and predictably and little in the future but not  right now. things are going well.  >> they need to do an  inter-meeting cut or 50 bases  points, half a percentage point  when they meet again in mid  september. either of those it would seem to me, to your point, might send  the wrong signal. ie, that the economy is in worse shape than we're led to believe. that there's something they see  that we don't. >> that's exactly right. a major cut right now either  preemptively ahead of next  meeting or a big cut at the next meeting would tell the market  that the fed is scared. if they're scared, we should  definitely be scared. that's the wrong message to send right now. i think we need to show a sign  of calm. let them understand, the market  understand things are working  correctly and investors  shouldn't be pushing the fed  into decision making because  they lost a few percentage of  their capital the last three  days. things are working well. let the fed do their job  patiently and predictably.  >> if i'm lucky now have  discretionary capital laying  around, got cash that i want to  put to work, where would you  advise people to do it? >> there's a few things you do  right now. number one f you did make some  money in tech, i think it's a  great time to move that money  into traditional defensives. not because you need to hide  out. the traditional defenses of  healthcare and staples look very attractive. in particular, charles river  labs they report tonight. they probably have to cut  guidance. but twwhen they do, it's likely  last cut. they have done a phenomenal job  in insisting through clinical  research and gaining market  share through acquisitions and  organic investments. great place for defense and  offense over the next 24 months. >> similar kind of question,  bryan. if we look at the labor market  and all of a sudden it does  weaken considerably in the next  month or two, there was  something more to this slow down and calls for rate cuts. even if it doesn't weaken, the  fed is passively tightening  because inflation keeps dropping and inflation expectations too.  >> that's right. i think we want labor to  continue to loosen up. we want unemployment to move  higher so we can make sure we  definitely squashed out the  inflation issue. now we don't want to move too  quickly, but the reality is the  fed is balancing this for  delicate fashion. so unemployment likely does  slowly move higher. the fed will then take that into consideration and we'll see a  cut in the future. but, right now, that doesn't  really concern me as an  investor. i think there's a lot of  companies that can fight through this economic cycle and control  their own destiny by using their capital very wisely.  >> are you concerned at all  about a recession in the u.s.? >> of course. we're paid to concerned. we want to worry about that. but you want to own businesses  that will both protect capital  and compound capital. we don't want to ever build a  portfolio that's requiring the  generosity of the fed to make  sure all recessions go away  forever. investors have been conditioned  for 40 years now that we're  never going to have economic  cycles and business cycles. the second we do, the fed jumps  into the rescue. that's not normal. we'll go through cycles. we need to invest through those  by being very cautious and  careful with the businesses we  own. today i think there's plenty of  places to put capital work to  help you navigate whatever cycle is ahead of us.  >> you're supposed to look at  mid caps as a strategy that puts you between the argument about  whether you should go with big  tech or rotate into small caps. so what, in fact, do you think  happens to your favorite names  right now? >> right now i think you want to move down cap. whether it's from large and mid  or mid into small. i'm comfortable with either one  of those. there has been so much capital  pushed up cap because of both  fear around the fed missing  their window and greed around  the ai trade. that capital is going to find a  home somewhere. layer on top of that the carry  trade still unwinding. that will push more capital  probably out of large caps. i feel very comfortable moving  down cap and moving to value  actually. in the very initial phases of  the fed's challenge, economi

Title: White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre holds a briefing with reporters — 8/6/2024
Transcript:
all right good afternoon everyone hi hi oua all right i just have one thing at the top and then we'll get started so today we are praying for the people of florida and others along the southeast coast who are being impacted by tropical storm debbie including those who have tragically lost their lives the president continues to receive updates from his team on the impacts of the storm and federal efforts to support the state and local response the biden harris administration has been in close touch with officials from affected states and fema has deployed staff to the region to support as needed fema has also deployed multiple incident management assistance teams urban search and rescue teams as well as water and meals additionally personnel from dod hhs us army corps of engineers and us coast guard have deployed and are prepared to support as needed the president has approved emergency declaration request from the governors of florida south carolina and georgia which will unlock bl additional federal resources this storm isn't over yet so we urge everyone in its path to remain vigilant heed the warnings of local officials and visit ready.gov again ready.gov for tips on how to stay safe darling good to see you good to see you too thank you all right um did the president get the news about walls before news organization started reporting on it or after i can say that uh the president did receive a call uh this morning from the vice president ahead uh ahead of uh ahead of the confirmation the news uh being out there so he heard it first from the vice president he heard it first from the vice president yes can you give us a little bit of color about where he was when he took the call was he in the oval so what i can tell you he was here at the white house uh i i can't pinpoint where exactly he was if he was here or the residents uh but he definitely heard from the vice president first uh she called him to let him know of her pay and then one foreign policy question um the readout of the president's call with lcc included this line that said president biden thanked him for his determined leadership in the facilitation of negotiations that have now reached a final stage i was a little surprised by the reference to final stage can you elaborate on on that a little bit so look i'm not going to go beyond what the president stated we have been very clear that uh it is important uh that uh the the um ceasefire deal the hostage deal gets done it has been a priority for this president uh for some time now uh his team you heard from national security adviser jake sullivan last week last thursday he spoke about this this has been uh a priority you've heard from the president directly he wants to get this done he wants the war to end uh he wants hostages to come home and to go home to their loved ones and families and so we believe uh that this this war the end of this war uh would significantly lower tensions in the region and so we have been certainly uh laser focus on getting that done i don't have anything beyond the readout that you received from us moments ago and then quickly is there any reaction to the announcement a short time ago by hamas that they've chosen senoir as their new leader don't have anything to to to say at this point thank you karine did president biden have a favorite contender in beep stakes and did he express that to the vice president so well here's what i'll say and i want to point you to the president's statement right uh that he put out uh not too long after uh the vice president made uh her announcement going to be really mindful we can follow the law here and can't comment on 2024 but just to say like he what he did mention he has known governor walz uh for two decades and worked with him when they both served in congress and then during the biden harris administration in his capacity as governor of minnesota president biden respects governor wals as a strong principal effective leader who fights for working people someone who has never forgotten where he came from growing up on a midwestern farm president biden respects governor wal's life of service serving in the army national guard for 24 years and becoming the highest ranking enlisted soldier to serve in congress serving his community as a teacher as a high school football co coach and serving as governor where governor waltz lowered the cost of insulin to 35 bucks has fought to protect women's fundamental rights ended junk fees and cut taxes for middle class families the president is grateful that they have been able to work together to get those important priorities done uh for um for more obviously uh for the american people more broadly look if you're asking me if the vice president sought the the president's uh advice she did uh and we have said this before and i've said this many times they are a strong team together she's a critical partner to this president she has been for the past 3 and a half years and they have discussions regularly uh of both domestic and international importance and this was this situation is no different uh and so he did offer up uh his advice and i'll leave it there okay um turning to the economy in light of the july jobs report claudia sam um said that she doesn't think that the country is in a recession right now but we're getting uncomfortably close to that situation does the president his team ag agree with that and and what are they doing to prevent that for so here's what i'll say and just a couple of things at the top here while we've seen some volatility we admit that we have seen that uh our broader economy remains resilient and we see that because of the data obviously that's been coming out over the past not just a couple of months but um the past couple of years and what we have seen recently is consumers remain resilient and business investment remains strong unemployment while up from 50-year lows is still low at 4.3 % and that's important you think about inflation it's down by 2.5% and the stock market is more than 35% under this administration uh is is is up more pardon me than 35% under this administration and so what we're going to focus on we're going to focus on the middle class we're going to focus on working families we're going to focus on continuing to lower costs whether it's prescription drugs u building homes that are affordable for folks uh and taking on price gouging it's very different than what the other side republicans want to do they want to give tax breaks to billionaires corporations that what we that's what we continue to see them talk about wanting to do and let's not forget they want to uh uh they want to make sure that social cut social security and medicare that is what they've been saying that they're going to do we are going to uh the economic team is going to continue to monitor the situation uh but we believe that the economy remains resilient and that's what's going to be our focus thank you hey karine thank you in the last hour the justice department announced that a pakistani man with ties to iran was arrested for a plot to kill former president trump this plot was spoiled we not even a month from the assassination attempt in pennsylvania what is the administration's reaction to this i mean another assassination attempt on so i'll say this uh so we are aware of of the indictment uh that you're mentioning by the doj today going to be really mindful i will refer you to uh doj as it's an going law enforcement investigation i i'll add this that based on doj's ongoing investigation there has been no evidence to suggest that the individual named in today's indictment has any connection to the assassination attemp against former president trump that happened in butler pennsylvania uh but i but anything else that is something that i would have to refer to department of jus what happened i mean this this plot uh look we have said many many times and i want to be really clear because this is a doj it's an ongoing law enforcement doj indictment so not going to be really mindful but we have said many times that we've been tracking iranian threats against former uh politicians we've been very clear about that uh these threats arise from iran's desire to seek revenge for the killing of of uh kasm salomani we consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority the highest priority we have repeatedly met at the highest levels of our government to develop and implement a comprehensive response to this to these threats as part of the comprehensive response we have invested extraordinary resources in developing additional information about these threats disrupting individuals involved in these threats enhancing protective arrangements and potential targets of these threats engaging with foreign partners and directly warning iran so we've been clear we have said this for the past uh past several months for some time now uh but as i just stated we're aware of the indictment announcement today by doj that is something doj to speak directly to on the specifics follow up on iran just very briefly and i appreciate it um israel could be under attack any moment from iran uh us troops in iraq were injured yesterday why have we not heard directly from president biden this week we know he met with his team yesterday we know today's vp harris is big day but he's still the president where is he well here's the thing you have seen the president he is he has uh been very clear about uh about making sure that we uh continue to try to deescalate itions we just put out two readouts a readout two readouts today uh a readout yesterday uh and our our focus right now is to make sure that we continue to dry to try to deescalate uh tensions here and that's what the president has been doing uh he's been very focused on that talking to our partners to make sure that we get that done i was asked about uh i was back from that readout that we just put out i was asked about uh the ceasefire deal and what the president that last line that that was pointed out to me that is something that the president has been focused on get getting that done i don't have anything beyond what we put out but we're monitoring the situation closely we want to make sure that we get to uh we get to continue to have those deescalation conversation you had secretary blinkin has a number had had a number of conversation with partners the president as i just said speaking to king ab abdullah uh king uh king of jordan yesterday and the leaders of qatar in egypt this morning we put out a readout and so that's what he's doing that's what he's going to continue to focus on doing is trying to make sure that we deescalate tension we expect to see him this week cuz i know you guys haven't been putting out the schedule uh you know we've been getting it the night before so what's we are in a different time as i've said many times before and you will get to see the president uh that i can say look um it is certainly the president's priority um to make sure that we do everything that we can uh to protect our national security right to make sure they do everything that we can uh to work with our our partners and deescalate the tensions in the middle east is certainly something that we uh want to make sure uh that uh that we continue to do um uh i do want to mention you mentioned hezbollah attacks on israel last night i do want to add that we while we do not believe the response has started yet we remain concerned by the increase in violence including the firing drones by hezbollah into israel and we're going to continue to have those conversation uh to continue to try to deescalate the situation that we're in okay uh karen i know you're limited in what you can say about this but does the president plan to physically campaign with the new democratic f um again like as you just stated i'm limited on what can i i can say about the president campaigning you saw the president statement i kind of read a little bit from the statement today uh i don't have anything else to add uh the president has known again uh the vi the the running mate uh nominee for vice president for some time for a few decades uh they have worked closely together on getting a lot of things done in the past three and a half years uh and he put out his statement le it's that and we will have more the campaign will have more to share on what his his political events would look like is it his intention to take time to campaign physically the president as he has stated his intention is to focus on the american people to deliver continuing deliver and build on the unprecedented successes historic uh historic successes that he has had in the last three and a half years with the vice president that's his focus uh and i don't have anything else to add as it relates to the campaign that's something the campaign can speak to in the foreign policy arena you touched on this but what more can you tell us about that suspected rock that rocket attack in the air base in iraq that injured seven personnel so um yeah so that so yeah there's been a lot of things happening unfortunately um so i will say this the united states condemns the attack on the alassad base yesterday our hearts go out to the service members we were who were injured and we are hoping for a speedy recovery we will respond to any attack against our personnel in a manner and place of our choosing uh and i can say the president was briefed on the attack at it as it was underway uh and the seven members were were injured in the attack thankfully thankfully no one uh lost their lives and we are uh praying for a speedy recovery for those service members k you mentioned deescalation efforts but what does the us still believe that a retaliatory attack against israel is in what i can say is we're monitoring everything closely what we are focusing on is as you just stated in your your question to me is having those deescalation conversations you just you just uh saw two readouts that the president did uh and then also obviously uh the king of jordan yesterday and so that's what we're going to focus on secretary blinkin obviously has had multiple conversations as well uh and so that is our focus and we're going to continue uh we're going to continue to monitor the situation hi green thank you i'm curious do you see any similarities between governor waltz and the president in terms of the voters they connect with can't speak to voters specifically that's not something i'm going to do especially as we're talking about 2024 uh i think you can see from and being really mindful here i think you can see from the president's statements uh how much he appreciates uh governor waltz uh what he has been able to do for his uh for his state uh and also he has an impressive background uh he is someone uh with values that the president appreciates obviously now the vice president does as as well as as she has uh picked him to be her running mate uh but i can't speak to voters about this that is something the campaign can speak to uh more precisely but the president has known uh the governor for some time for decades now appreciates working with him closely on getting big things done on getting big things done for the american people more broadly well and on the economy yesterday's stock market diffs being the latest big concern for voters i'm curious mean what can biden do in this last 6 months to restore confidence there so look what we're going to save laser focused on and i said this moment ago when i was uh answering the question to oua is going to focus on working families and and uh middle class that's what the president is going to continue to do he talks about building an economy from the bottom up middle out that's what he's going to focus on he talks about making sure that we're lowering cost and doing continuing to do that whether it's prescription drugs let's not forget because of this president now we are able to uh to you know beat big fra medicare is able to negotiate uh we want to make sure that we build uh build more homes affordable homes for americans lower costs that is something that he wants to continue to do and i think because of the successes that we've had in the economy and doing just that uh that's what the the american people want to see uh more more broadly i would say the economy remains resilient uh and that's going to be our focus right now is going to be the the american people i just want to pick up on the economy question so i think one of the concerns is not so much about you know the stock market reaction specifically but that it reveals deeper concerns about the level of deficits and other sort of potential vulnerabilities um are you you know i know you're monitoring what's happening but what what can you say about the sort of the stability of the global economic system and whether yesterday this route kind of sends troubling signals about how stable it is so look as you just stated as well in your statement are our economic team is going to continue to monitor right what's happening both here and around the world that's something that they they're going to do we believe the us economy remains resilient and uh with strong growth investment consumption and productivity uh and so that is uh certainly our focus and we're look we're going to continue to keep keep keep an eye on what's happening that's what the e economic team is going to continue to do again we believe the economy remains resilient there's data that proves that whether it's unemployment whether it's flation down by 2.5% uh whether it's consumers that remain you know remain resilient all of those that those data points are important uh and so we're going to focus on the middle class the american people working people and seeing what else we can do to lower costs that is what they care about and uh that's going to continue to be our focus for the next five months a number of economists have called for emergency rate cuts i realized that said rate is independent but to what extent um are you uh sort of accelerating conversations you know has the president had any conversations recently with j powell or other economists or his own advisors about the coming did he get you know fully briefed yesterday about what was happening so i can say the president and the vice president have been fully briefed by their economic team they that's something that uh uh they are regularly updated and as i said the econ economic team is going to continue to monitor this very closely as it relates to the fed that is they are independent the president is very has always been very serious about that unlike the last administration the fed is independent we do not get involved in any monetary policy decisions that they make they make that independently what we're focused on is how do we continue to build on the economy build on the successes that we've been able to do the last three and a half years and we understand what the president inherited when he walked in was a you know an economic uh economy that was in a downturn he had to turn that around and that's what the president was able to do but we also understand that the american people still want to see more they want to see lower costs right they still are feeling this uh feeling what we saw once in a century pandemic that the president had to deal with so that's why our focus is going to be just that the working class the middle class what else can we do to lower those costs as we have been uh doing for the past three and a half years thank you green on middle east all of the readouts on the president's discussions with various leaders have said that the goal is to deescalate tensions are there any signs that that diplomacy is having its intended effect so look we're going to continue to have those conversations that's going to be really important look since beginning since the since uh the beginning of this conflict we have worked to make sure israel has what it needs to defend itself to elevate the suffering of the palestinian people in gaza and manage risk in the region that's what we have done that's why the president continues to work to make sure uh that we get a ceasefire deal we get those hostages home we increase continue to increase humanitarian aid and end this war in gazet that's what we want to see and in the meantime what we've been doing as well is having these uh diplomatic conversation talking to our partners uh as you just stated from the readouts that we put out today and also yesterday uh and that's going to be our focus it's not just it's not just the president uh and the vice president it's also secretary blinkin it's his team that are having these conversations as well uh and so that is the our part that we're playing in this moment we're going to continue to monitor uh the situation very very closely but these di diplomatic conversation these uh deescalation trying to deescalate tensions is important as well the calls with the king of jordan um the lebanese government the qataris the egyptians g7 what do you see as the result of those conversations i mean look we have seen under this president what happens when you have diplomacy when you talk to your partners and allies this is some a president has been able to get things done whether it's lowering tensions or whether it's actually getting things done uh on behalf of our national security uh making sure the american people are kept safe or uh what needs to happen in a region right in this particular instance de escalating tension in a particular region which is the middle east and so the conversations happen that we have to continue we have to continue to have these uh conversations the president's going to do that as you have seen the last two days uh and beyond not just the last two days and so that is our focus here today and on the selection of governor waltz um the democratic party once again is rallying around vice president harris uh just today on the selection of her running mate it was just 16 days ago that the president withdrew from the race himself has that unity and that enthusiasm surprised him at all i don't i look what i will say is this um the president and we've said this already the president made his decision because he knew what needed to do what to be needed to be done um he said that in his letter he said that in the oval office address he talked about passing the the baton he talked about unifying the party and he believed the action that he took would unify the uh the party the democratic party and we saw that to your point so he's not surprised that's what he wanted that's what he expected and he also knew from the moment when he picked the vice president harris right to be his running mate back in 2020 he said more very recently it was the best decision that he's made and it was the best decision that he made because he knew that she would be ready ready to lead on day one and has been a critical partner with him in the last 3 and a half years so he's not surprised he's not surprised that she was ready to go yeah danny thanks green um you mentioned the importance of diplomacy have there been any um direct contacts with tran itself to say as president biden would say don't you to tell us so we send messages uh to iran when it's in our interest and not certainly going to comment uh from here on the messages or our channels that's not i'm going to do from here what i will say is i've that we've been clear that we will defend israel but we do not want this conflict to escalate or spread we've been very consistent about that from here uh we do not want it to to spread further into the region we've convened the same messages to our counterparts in the region as i've just stated and asked them to encourage iran to refrain uh from escalating tensions uh and so these deescalation coners ation are going to continue that's what we want to see uh we're going to continue to have conversations on how to get the ceasefire deal done to get hostages home to their families to get that humanitarian aid continue to get that humanitarian aid into gaza and that's what we want to see we want to see the war in gaza end and obviously we want to see a deescalation intentions as well in the region and just one other thing closer to home um can we expect any kind of press conference from vice president at any time soon oh that's for her team to speak too i i can't speak to that from here okay thanks ken um just wanted to see so on the ceasefire um what is president biden's current timeline um it's now you know almost middle of august does he think he can get this done by the end of his term or what is the timeline he is tracking it's critical it's a priority to get this done and we want to get it done as soon as possible that's what we've been working on his team has been working on this 24/7 it is critical it is important to get these the ceasefire done to bring hostages home to get that humanitarian aid in uh to gaza continuing to increase that humanitarian aid he wants to see the ceasefire deal done and does he think it will be done for the election i i don't have a timeline for you this is not about politics here this is not about the election this is about the right thing to do and that's what we want to see get done just um on the economy has president biden you know has he met with any um bank bank ceos or have any plans to you know meet with i don't know maybe don't have any meetings to read out to you at this time good um also thank you um on the economy um does the president have a view or the white house have a view about what caused the selloff on monday like what the sort of reason was for it look i can tell you that he's been briefed by his economic team he and the vice president they're aware they're going to continue to stay updated don't have anything be beyond that what i can say is the broader economic uh remain economy remains resilient we believe that's what we believe the us economy remains resilient and we're going to continue to do the work on behalf of working working americans and also the middle class that is going to be our focus and then um there are some economists who believe that um uh there's been a shift to where inflation was a major concern and this sort of moment triggered a shift to um the jobs numbers and unemployment being more significant can you speak to that at all the white house views there being like a a ground shift going on so look um what we're seeing is the steady is the steady and stable growth we've called for that's what we're seeing talking about the jobs numbers uh from last from last week i believe uh and look this is a president that took on an economy that was in a downfall right because of the pandemic we saw uh businesses closing schools closing and he had had to come in and do uh and do what you've seen him do this past three and a half years turn the economy around restart the economy and we have seen uh the economy grew to strong in 2.8 by 2.8% last quarter nearly 16 million jobs the lowest average unemployment as i just mentioned uh that we've seen inflation down 2.5% that's because of the work that this president has done so we're seeing a steady and stable growth as we have been talking about for some time and we're seeing that that's what we believe the jobs numbers showed us uh just last week it is very different than what republicans and congress want to do they want to cut taxes for corporations and billionaires that's not what we want to do right we want to give a break to working families and uh middle class families they want to they want to cut social security medicare that's not what we want to do you've seen this president who wants to protect social security and medicare so that's our that's our focus that's what we're going to continue to do but we believe that we are indeed in a steady and stable growth uh as we've been talking out and the economic team is going to continue to monitor uh the situations that have developed over the last 24 hours or so okay um when i come the situation in the middle east what signs is the administration seeing that iran is preparing to attack israel so look um we're going to continue to monitor the situation you saw i hope you saw the statement from the department of defense this past friday on what they're doing with their forc posture adjustments prepar preparing making sure that uh we are giving um israel that increased support that they need uh in the meantime we're going to continue to have these conversations we're going to continue to try to do everything that we can to deescalate the tensions hence the readouts that we put out today and also yesterday that's going to be our focus uh anything else i don't have anything beyond that but we're continue to monitor everything closely get thanks karine uh couple questions for you now that donald trump is the republican nominee is he getting the intelligence briefings that it's traditional for presidential nominees to get so that's something for od and to speak to i would refer you to them and then here at the white house have you guys started the transition process and who's going to be in charge of that and why trying to kick us out already got five months it's a lot more work than people realize to pack up an administration uh i don't have anything to share about that at this time okay go ahead good noad thank you so much karine on foreign policy starting with venezuela can the white house clarify where it stands on ad mundo gonzalez does the administration see him as a legitimate president of venezuela and if so what steps are you taking or preparing to take to you know legitimizing so a couple of things um so and i believe the the state department put put out a statement just last week uh so i'll say this uh the united states has been in in close coordination with regional and international partners following venezuela's presidential election on june 28th and rapid declaration of the of the national electoral council that nicholas maduro won without evidence this is a critical moment for democracy in our shared hemisphere the opposition and civil society have published more than 80% of the tally sheets received from polling stations throughout venezuela which indicate that amando gonzalez arua received the most votes by an insurmountable margin independent observers pre-ect ction and exit poles and quick counts corroborated these results the will of the people must be respected at least 12 million v venezuelan courageously went to the polls despite significant challenges and exercised their democratic right to vote now is the time for the venezuelan parties to begin a respectful peaceful dialogue and discussions in accordance with their laws and the votes of the people to chart the path forward for a more democratic prosperous and also secure venezuela so i'd reiterate the united states commitment to supporting this process of reestablish democratic norms in venezuela and stand ready to consider ways to bolster these efforts jointly with our international uh partners thank you um on iran and then i do have a question about bangladesh because of course it's very timely but let me start with iran pakistan said at a recent oic meeting that they would willingly supply iran with mid-range missiles if the war continues um you know what is the ad has the admin ministration spoken to his lad about this expressed concerns and if so what's the message i mean i think we've been very clear with our message right i've said somebody asked me what's how do we um uh communicate with iran obviously we have uh we we have our partners out there that does the communications uh we have ways to do that obviously i'm not going to lay that out other ways to do that i'm not going to lay that out from here but i think we've been very clear we've been very clear in our support for israel and making sure they have what they need to defend themselves uh and i don't think that you can look at this administration and not know what the message has been uh and what we have been very clear about and so uh when when we send messages to iran uh it is within our interest and uh and i'll just leave it there okay then quickly on bangladesh concerning events in daca has the white house reached out to parties in daaka and what would you like to see happen next so we so we're monitoring the situation in bangladesh uh very closely uh we have long called for respective democratic rights in bangladesh and we urge that the interim government formation be democratic and inclusive we commend the army for the restraint they have showed we encourage all parties to refrain from from further violence and restore peace as quickly as possible we express our deep concern and sadness about the reports of casualties and injuries over the weekend and past weeks and we share our deepest condolences with those who lost loved ones and those who are suffering it will be vital for the new government to carefully and credibly investigate all attacks and provide accountability and justice uh for victims good garen uh today is the 59th anniversary of the voting rights act um and data from the britain center for justice uh shows that since the supreme court struck down section five of the v voter turnout gas between black and brown voters and white voters has continued to grow uh given president biden's executive order on expanding access to voter registration is any update that the white house can provide to that and does the president see the issue of voting rights as as a top priority does he believe that he can have some renewed efforts to get those those bills passed in so look as you know today is the anniversary of 1965 voting rights i believe the vice president put out um uh uh called for a day of action today uh so that's important to highlight the need the need of you just stated of federal legislation uh and to also to encourage all eligible americans to exercise their right to vote i think that is something that not just obviously the vice president and the president have spoken to uh since almost day one day one of their administration when the president signed an executive order to do everything that we can from the federal level uh to make sure that voting is is is more accessible e more easily accessible uh to americans across the country and that is something that the president understands and continues uh to do everything that we can uh to make that happen the john lewis voting rights advancement act and and the freedom to vote act that is something that we want to see get done we have to see legislation in order to deal with this issue we have to see legislation and so we're going to continue to call on that they have to congress has to do everything that they can to protect our freedom to vote uh and so it is part of our democracy and so in the meantime we're working to ensure that every eligible american can exercise their right to vote and have their vote counted uh and i can assure you that is something both the president and the vice president are committed to and you saw that because of the them sign him signing the eo very early on in his administration i believe on day one of his administration another question yeah um as the vice president uh begins her battleground state travels this week uh many black and brown americans are still looking to learn more about the vice president particularly her work here at the white house um and given that can you speak to the role of the vice president has had played in advising or crafting uh some of this administration's signature equity policies whether that be justice 40 investments and infrastructure and climate or investments in black businesses etc i mean look they're partners the president and the vice president have been critical partners they are they're partners in everything that has been done outside out come out of this administration the bay harris administration and you just mentioned a few things right you think about the chips and science acts the bipartisan infrastructure legislation the pct act uh all of these important critical uh legislation the american rescue plan inflation reduction uh act those are those are those are legislation that she was very involved in and at the center of those uh historical piece of legislation you had equity equity was always at the center of that making sure no community is left behind uh and so she's been at the table uh she has been uh giving voice uh to these uh critical decisions that they both made together and they recognize the advancing equity is a generational commitment uh that requires sustained federal leadership that requires uh to make sure that we partner with our our communities as well and so this is something that we are going to continue to do uh we talk about the next five months obviously there something that this president and the biden harris administration wants to continue to do and uphold i mentioned today how the the um uh vice president uh called today a day of action because it is an anniversary of 1965 voting rights act uh and so we are acutely aware we are acutely aware of what's going on uh and that's why the president on day one signed that executive action thanks couple of questions on disperate topics one of the president's aspirations for the remainder of his term is uh supreme court reform or restructuring however you want to term it at the weekend uh justice gorsuch said in a tv interview quote i just say be careful um does the white house have any response either to the implication of that lack of carefulness or i'm not i'm not i'm not going to comment to to the justice the president made himself very clear over a week ago he went to uh austin texas went to lvj library gave a very i believe important speech he believes an important speech on uh on reform and for scotus right uh supreme court reform it is important he and he laid out three ways to get to that uh point a lot of that obviously those three uh ways that he laid out out is supported many of that is supported by uh conservatives uh you know uh uh experts on this and look the president believes that nobody's above the law nobody's above the law the highest court of the land should not be above the law and he's going to he wants to work with congress on making that happen he laid that out very very clearly i'm not going to respond to the justice just a very different topic we're um just a day or two away from the oneyear anniversary of the wildfire that affected maui and specifically l um so seriously um as far as i know there are a number of people still struggling with long-term housing needs and so forth yeah um what's the federal government doing about that so we want to take a moment to remember the 102 uh individuals whose lives were lost uh and thousands of survivors who whose lives were changed forever changed because of what happened almost a year ago uh in april the temporary elementary school opened uh for the hundreds of students displaced uh by the fires providing the students with the assurance they would have a school to return to by the end of the summer fema continues to work closely with state officials that is something obviously fema is committed to and relocate survivors from hotel it's a long this is a long-term process uh we understood that it would not take uh this would not take weeks or months uh this is going to take some time but fema continues to work on this you have the us army corps of engineers continues to make to make significant progress uh the president made clear when he visited maui that uh uh this administration will continue to do everything that it it can to make sure that people get back on its feet it's a long process uh and uh but we're still there i just mentioned the us army corps i just mentioned fema and we're going to continue to do everything that we can uh to get pe to get folks back on their feet but also do not want to forget the lives that were lost if we were to see the president this week and he were to uh discuss the what's happening on wall street uh is there a direct message you could say to investors to prevent a future selloff like the one we saw earlier look i'm i'm not going to to speak to that directly what i'm going to speak to is the economy as we see it right now as we view it uh it is resilient that is what's important we i've laid out the data points of why we believe this economy continues to be resilient we are going to focus on what matters to the american people also which is make sure that we lower costs for to them that's going to be our focus our economic team they're going to monitor everything closely they're going to update the president and the vice president and that's what we're going to focus on okay thank you two weeks ago the president said he would appoint a new director to the secret service following the resignation of former director cheel is there an update on that process could it happen before the election or perhaps it's after the election is there is there any update on the independent review so this is i mean this is not about politics not about the election here this is about making sure that we find the right person for the job the president has always taken that very seriously when it comes to appointing uh people for important uh positions here in this administration i don't have a timeline an update for you at this time uh but the president is thinking through this wants to make sure uh that we have the right person for the job and once we have an announcement obviously we will share that with all of you update on the independent review to the trump assist nation attempt uh i don't have an update on the independent review obviously when the when we saw the assassination attempt of the former president the president took that very seriously he spoke right after talked about wanting to make sure that we had an independent review wanted to make sure that the american people got the answers uh and so we're going to they're going to work continue to work on that uh and also talked about lowering uh the rhetoric right making sure that we lower the temperature he condemned uh that act of violence there should be no form of violence in our politics ics uh and so he's going to continue to be very clear about that the review continues once we once they have more to share certainly we will share that with all of you okay to thank you uh republicans are uh attacking governor walls as a rical liberal they pointed to his policies on climate on gender on free school meals for children free tuition um one republican congressman said that the harris walls ticket would be a socialist dream and i wonder if you have a response from the white house i mean look i think i this is some a place where i would refer you to um uh obviously the president's statement about governor walls and i certainly will leave it there uh but when it comes to the biden harris administration we cannot forget we inherited a skyrocket rocketing murder rate that's something that we inherited from the prior administration and working together we were not only uh turned around uh turned that around but have brought uh brought violent crime to a 50-year low that is something that the president was able to do with his partnership with the vice president and you know we want to continue uh to make sure that we for example when we think about gun crime we want to continue to work on that and we were able to pass the a legislation that we hadn't seen on gun on fighting gun violence in 30 years that is something that the president and this vice president has been able to do so we have taken this really seriously and right now majority of house republic an want to defund the police by cut cutting the cops program you think about the american rescue plan the reason why we're able to deal with crime in this country republicans didn't vote on it not one republican voted for the american rescue plan so i think we have shown how much we want to deliver for the american people that is what this administration is about this administration is about it doesn't matter if you're a red state or blue state the president wants to make sure he's delivering for the american people and that's his focus and you saw that from the obviously vice president being partners that's the focus one more on former speaker pelosi she was on television yesterday she was asked whether or not she spoken to the president since he dropped out of the presidential rate she said she had not she was asked if their relationship was okay and she said you'd have to ask him so what is the status of the relationship with president and the former speaker uh so um as far as the last time they spoke i'm not going to get into private communications here or or uh conversations just not going to speak to that look president biden uh respects his good friend speaker pelosi we believe it's mutual and her statement i'll just read it to you all here his legacy of vision values and leadership make him one of the most consequential presidents in american history with love and gratitude to president biden for always believing in the promise of america and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment god blessed america with joe biden's greatness and goodness again he respect his good friend uh former speaker pelosi and we believe it's mutual as i just read her quote right after he made his uh his decision all right everybody i'll see you tomorrow thank you thank you thank you

Title: 3-Stock Lunch: Deere, Zoetis and Lamb Weston
Transcript:
today.  >> bryant, thank you very much. we appreciate your time today. >> thank you. >>> and now it's time for  today's three-stock lunch. as volatility hits wall street,  we asked our trader to pick  three names from a cnbc  portfolio protection screener,  whether he agrees or disagrees  with owning the stocks. the criteria has to be s&p 500  member, be low volatility stock  with beta less that be 1. eps growth of 10% or more in the past 3 years and consensus buy  rating price target upside of  20% or more. so, chris agreed to this. chief equity strategist at  m.i.a. capital investment. great to see you. you disagree. why wouldn't you want to own it  here? >> yeah, kelly, good to be with  you guys again. so the exercise here is to try  to pick some safe stocks that  ought to do well even if the  market doesn't. i don't think deere fits into  that category. it's a good, strong company with a good balance sheet. the beta is not that low,  it's .94, so almost 1. deere is susceptible to  recessions. just not industrial recessions  that we're used to but more  farmland recessions. and i fear that we're kind of  due for something like that. so if you're looking for a  company that can sail through a  recession, i think you should  look elsewhere than deere.  >> let's look at one you pulled  as one you agree with. the animal health company,  zoetis.  >> yeah, thank you so much. so the zoetis is a terrific  competitor. not that many competitors that  focus just on animal health. they just reported earnings this morning. it was double digit revenue  growth and earnings. this is a company you can  imagine doing well during a  recession because, you know,  folks will stop spending money  on travel and other things but  they'll continue to spend money  especially where the health of  their pet is concerned. finally, it's not a cheap stock. but it's growing nicely and it's exceeding expectations. so this is the one i would put  into a safety portfolio.  >> okay. another one now that you  disagree with is lam westin. the upside to average price  target on this one is about 20%. it has the eps growth over the  past three years of 31%, but is  the tide turning now? everyone is wondering after  those poor results. sounds like you're a little bit  concerned about that. >> i am, kelly. and this is a tough one because  i'm a value guy. and boy, lamb weston screens as  very cheap. the problem we have here is we  have a lot of research in the  french fry industry. this is not ai, it's french  fries. it's not terribly controversial. but our research tells us that  stuff is really quite difficult  at lamb weston right now. they kept prices high during the pandemic, alienated a lot of  customers. now that supply is more  available the customers have  gone elsewhere. so this is a real show me stock. i'm afraid right now it's a  value trap. i would stay away. >> how, chris, do you  characterize or describe this  period of market spasm we seem  to be going through over the  past three or four weeks. some of it feels kind of  seasonal to me. it feels like an august, like i  have seen this movie before. >> yeah. i don't want to be glib, tyler,  but we love this stuff because  finally folks understand that  equitis don't go in just one  direction. so it presents opportunities for investors like us to take  advantage of the panic. and there have been several  times over the last five years  where the vicks has spiked. you go back and look at what  caused it, you can hardly  remember those events. so i think we're in a place like that. i think the economy is pre

Title: Caterpillar's energy and transportation business worked well, says Stephen Volkman on earnings
Transcript:
>>> welcome back to "power  lunch." shares of caterpillar are up 3%  today on pace for its biggest  gains since january. the move comes after the  industrial giant beat earnings  per share expectations for the  sixth straight quarter posting a 15% year over year boost in  sales. still, the brand reported a 7%  decline in construction  equipment sales and i 10%  decrease in mining equipment  from the prior year. let's dive in further here with  stephen volkmann, machinery and  industrials analyst at  jefferies. so, stephen, how do they do it  if those key portion parts of  their business, construction and mining were down? >> right. tyler, we knew those would be  down and that's part of the  equation here, but really what  worked well was more the energy  and transportation business. as you guys know they have a  power gen business. i heard you talking about some  of the old economy power gen and that is, indeed, what's helping  caterpillar. a lot of this is for data  centers and other types of power gen, as well those were the  offsets and they did a better  job with margin even though the  end marks are choppy.  >> so internal cost control is  what you're talking about there. >> right.  >> cost of manufacturing and  were able to bring that down. >> so what does the future look  like for this industrial giant? >> yeah, so i think the future  is fairly bright here. at the end of the day we're  going through a bit of a soft  patch across industrials, but  really caterpillar is telling us and everybody else is agreeing  through earnings season that  nothing is falling off a cliff. nothing is getting meaningfully  worse. we are sort of managing our way  through this. as we come out and as we get fed rate cuts and as we get this  mega project revenues kicking in as we get to '25 and beyond i  think you will see more activity in mining, and i think you will  see for cat and i think things  will look fairly good once we  get out of the soft patch.  >> it's reassuring, stephen,  because for years we looked at  this as a bellwether of the  global economy. china in particular. what are we learning? >> yeah. so there's nothing really here  at the margin that's much  different. so china is fairly weak for  them. by the way, that's become a  pretty small piece of the pie  for cat in recent years. certainly well less than 5%  sales even though we looked at  it as a china play, right? >> nothing at the margin,  nothing is really changing  dramatically. so it's not telling us a lot  about the economy, but i think  the most important thing it's  telling us that we are not in  sort of this big downtrend, that we're not sort of approaching a  cliff event, a big recession in  the industrial space, and i  think some investors may worry  about that and cat's telling us  that's not the case.  >> how much is cat picking up  from the infrastructure spending that the biden administration  was able to get through  congress? >> that's helping at the margin, but it's in the early days,  tyler, because it takes a long  time for these projects to get  funded and for the funds to  start flowing. there has to be design and  environmental improvement and  you have to hire people, so this will be a multi-year kind of  process. it's starting now, tip of the  spear kind o

Title: Kamala Harris has restored the Democratic Party's election chances, says UVA's Larry Sabato
Transcript:
presumptively so for president  choosing minnesota governor tim  walz as her running mate. walz is the first kbofr to be a  democratic vice president  nominee in 100 years, or more  than. he is scheduled to appear later  today in philadelphia with  harris. here to discuss how this impacts the race for the white house is  larry, director of the center of politics at the university of  virginia. which has done very well in the  olympics by the way. i must point that out as an  alum. and our washington correspondent megan cassella joins us on set. larry, let me start with you. what do you think put walz over  the top? >> well, it could be been  process of elimination. you can never eliminate that as  a possibility in presidential or vice presidential selection. but i think partly it's because, as the democrats have been  telling us, it's about chemistry between kamala harris and the  person she wanted to pick as her running mate and potentially  governing mate during the next  four years. so that problem explains most of it. >> how about you, megan? do you see it that way? in order it's probably chemistry or maybe a process of  elimination that there was a  reason not to pick governor  shapiro of pennsylvania, maybe a reason not to pick any of the  others who were on the short  list? >> i think that's right. she was really looking for  somebody that she vibed with for lack of a better way of saying  it. she was looking for  compatibility and definitely  found that in walz. he doesn't have negatives in the way that some of these other  candidates had. worried about some -- there was  an opposition campaign against  josh shapiro. old sexual assault allegation  about an aide in his office and  concerns that he was too  moderate or unions weren't a fan of him because of support for  private school vouchers and some concern that maybe he was too  supportive of israel in a way  that would jeopardize in some  people's view the  administration, the future  administration's handling of  conflict over there, the war. so walz didn't have those  negatives. there's a question of whether he had as many positives as some of those folks, mainly i'm thinking about he doesn't come from a big state that will bring a big  electoral prize.  >> not a swing state. not bringing pennsylvania with  him the way shapiro might have. which larry, brings me back to  that. i kind of thought shapiro would  be the choice. he's forceful. he's from a swing state. he's popular in that state. >> well, you're right. i think that's why he was the  betting favorite. all the betting sites had him as a heavy favorite, at least the  last time i looked. and at one point senator kelly,  mark kelly from arizona, was  second but also quite high. walz was way behind a number of  others. even pete buttigieg was ahead of walz at a certain point. so it's a surprise. but you know, if you look at  vice presidential history, there have been lots of surprises. some of them work out well. some of them don't. we'll have to see. this campaign will tell the  tale. >> now we turn our attention to  the convention, which is next  week, the week after? it's coming up quickly. that was partly what pushed her  to make this decision now. then what? we don't know yet if there's  going to be the september  debates or singular events or  whatnot.  >> it's all up in the air. of course there could be an  october surprise as it's known. the convention two weeks from  now in chicago will be sort of  the big event. it's going to be more important  than usual for the democrats  this year because both of these  candidates will really be  introducing themselves. harris slightly better known on  the national stage. walz not hugely known on the  national stage. a lot of work to introduce them. they want to carry that for sort of an enthusiasm bump. they have this shortened  campaign. the benefit of it, it's a major  benefit for them in a lot of  ways. there's no time to lose  enthusiasm. no time to get distracted. so they really want to seize on  the convention. they're going to seize on those  debates whether they happen or  not. the fact that they didn't happen perhaps to keep driving interest and enthusiasm and hopefully all the way through november.  >> larry, as megan points out  the convention will be an  opportunity for kamala harris to introduce herself. it will also be an opportunity  for her perhaps to lay out  policy -- we don't know much  about what her policies are and  how they might difference from  joe biden's policies and maybe  she'll start to explain some of  that. you and i haven't spoken since  biden pulled out. i was on vacation for some of  that time. what does harris mean to the  democrat's chances in the fall? >> well, she dramatically  improved them. they were headed -- and this  came from within the democratic  party, with access to a lot of  private polling information,  with joe biden, whether he wants to admit it or his aides want to admit it, the democrats were  headed to a landslide, landslide defeat in the electoral college. harris has restored the  democrats. this is a tie. i mean, it could go either way. and you could argue the  electoral college makes trump  the favorite in a tie situation. i don't know. it's too early to say. but the democrats are in this  race, and they were out of this  race when biden was still in it. so it's meant a lots. and the other factor, megan  referred to this, the amazing  thing is people know very, very  little about kamala harris. and of course they know even  less about tim walz. i've had calls from all over the globe and the question they're  all asking in one form or  another is, tim, the last time  we had this was jimmy carter. jimmy who? they just never heard of him. know nothing about him. and that can be an advantage. the more you know, contempt  creeps in. familiarity breeds contempt. you never know what will come  out as jd vance discovered.  >> it's very interesting how  will kamala harris' policies  differ from bidens and how will  they differ from the policies  kamala harris ran in in 2020  when she was a candidate and  quite a -- staked out a  progressive position on most  issues. folks, we'll talk about this for the next couple months,

what kind of charting did you  see? and can you walk us through what exactly was the biggest thing  for you during the market  volatility? >> well, when you look at the  vix here, it actually has a lot  of feel of what happened back in august of 2007, what happened in the fall of 1998, these market  moving events where you have few things go wrong for the market. a little of lack of liquidity  occur and then all of a sudden  you get the third strike, people blame the yen carry trade on. we saw a lot of selling of the  mag 7 here the middle of july. those are major weightings in  all these indexes and etfs. now you have billions of dollars being sold in areas of the  market across the board. that ripple effect really  carried over and we saw the huge spike and the vix volatility  levels indicative of what  happened here and the selling  sort of progressed very, very  quickly and people basically  dealers looking to cover some  hedges and just sell into this  market. >> in other words, brian, there  have been a regime of low  volatility and people basically  collecting insurance premium for months and quarters now without  any fear of having to ever pay  out on the insurance policies  that they collected premium for. is it fair to say that the  volatility spike that we saw is  because all of a sudden the  chickens came home to roost and  all of a sudden these insurers  would actually maybe have to  start paying out against the  policies they collected so much  money for? was it like picking up pennies  in front of a steam roller? >> dom, it really was because  what basically happened is what  we saw is massive amounts of  demand for puts to the downside, whether it was people covering  all these short positions that  they had in the volatility space or whatnot. call buyers dried up. put buyers came into the market  and of course the market makers  and the dealers now having to  sell puts to people trying to  cover their insurance basically  have to sell into the market to  stay neutral to it. so, masses amounts of selling  from dealers and then obviously  all those people trying to pick  up the pennies in front of a  steam roller, getting steam  rolled and having to panic and  get out of this market really  caused a spike in volatility. we see the high demand for puts  on the downside like we saw,  this only happened a handful of  times literally over the last 15 years. this level of demand for put can really shake up the market. i think that's what drove the  vix to significantly high  levels.  >> brian, give us your trade. now we have seen today unwind a  good bit of what happened  yesterday, a billion dollar idea for the next 24 hours or longer  term idea or anything come to  mind? >> actually i do. this is something i have been  looking at for clients  throughout today. when we seen this occur before,  i said this happened maybe five  times the last 15 years. what happens the next couple  days of the market afterward, we get a sense is there going to be a reversal or people covering  back to what we had. we did, in fact, see a little  bit of that. we saw call buyers come into the market on the s&p 500. and now, all of a sudden we have some upside momentum going. and so i think you can put  together an options trade that  i've constructed where i want to buy a call spread and finance  it. i want to play to the upside  here because when this has  happened, we had this level of  panic in the market there's  opportunities to be had. i can buy the call spread while  at the same time minimizing some of that cost by selling the  downside put. this is the spider etf on the  s&p 500. looking to buy that call spread  and sell the 500 strike put  against the 538, 558 call spread out to september. i only have to pay $1 for this. this is a billion dollar idea. i pay a dollar. i don't have to own the market  until down 500 on the spider  etf. that's 5% to the downside. i have a push in here. and i get to participate to the  upside from 538 to 558. when we had these wash-outs  before, like i talked about,  seems like the next three to six months there's a rally. i'm not sure if this is august,  2007, and all of a sudden we're  in trouble six months from now. or if this is 1998 and there's  th

Transcript:
billion in q 2, bringing the  total well over to 17 trillion  nationwide. auto and credit card delinquency rates hitting a record high. here to discuss the state of  household date is co-host of the ramsey show. jade, great to have you here. as we're starting to see  delinquency rates tick up a  little bit in some of these data sets, what does that tell you? >> thanks for having me. right now americans are just  facing financial volatility  across the board. the struggle is real, as they  say. we've seen -- a lot of us  thought by now the fed would  have lowered interest rate. we haven't seen that. now we're seeing that play out  in the job market. that's really scary. we have the election coming up. we saw monday's dip in the stock market, right? even though inflation has  continued to tick down, it's  still really, really expensive  out there. and so americans have a lot that they're dealing with right now. their dollar is not stretching  as far as it once did.  >> yeah. and on that note, i guess the  question is with inflation  coming down and waging still  holding in there? could things get better or  should we assume they get more  stressed? >> i think you always have to be prepared, either way. ever a time to get your house in financial order, the time is  now. we teach you to get to financial peace. i think if americans can hone in on the first three baby steps. baby step one is getting $1,000  saved. most americans could not cover  $1,000 emergency without going  into some form of debt. so having $1,000 cushion is a  game changer. focussing in and paying off the  consumer debt, the car loans,  the credit card debt. getting that cleared out so that you can go back in, do baby step 3 which is saving up three to  six months of expenses. honestly during a time like  this, a lot of americans might  choose to have six months of  expenses laying around.  >> how much have rising prices  played into the rise in consumer debt? i actually thought american's  balance sheet were in pretty  good shape. but how much has the cost of  living increased over the past  three years played into the idea that americans -- many of them  need to borrow just to make ends meet.  >> absolutely. at the end of the day, our money is our money, right? we see it play out in realtime  when we go to the grocery store, when we go to the gas station. we feel the pinch. and so, budgeting is a core  principle into all of this. if we can look at our dollars  and cents and say, okay, here is what i can spend. here is what i cannot spend. and really accepting the fact -- my colleague says all the time,  we have to choose reality. so there's a reality here where  we have to accept. it might feel very uncomfortable for a while, but the slogan that i want all americans to kind of  take to heart right now is when  it comes to debt, just say no. debt is the problem. debt is what is making us feel  this stress and this anxiety in  our finances. we have to choose to draw a line in the sand. you can't solve a problem while  simultaneously creating it. so getting on a budget is going  to be that solution.  >> let's say i want to invest in my home. and i live in an area where home prices are going up. and i want to do an addition to  my home, but i don't have  $200,000 lying around, so i  think, well, let me take out a  home equity line of credit. is that a wise move, or do you  recommend against taking out  home equity loans and lines? >> i always advise against it. and in this case you're  borrowing against yourself. and you're putting your biggest  asset on the line and at risk  which is your home. the whole purpose of a home is  to build equity. we pull out of that in the form  of a loan, in many ways we're  robbing ourselves and putting  that asset at risk. in times like these when things  are volatile, we don't know what will happen from day to day. the last thing we want is more  debt and more risk in our li

Title: I think tech earnings growth will win, says Value Investment Group's Rashaun Williams
Transcript:
private markets? joining me now is r sean  williams of value investment  group. good to see you. >> good to see you.  >> i know you're thinking a lot  about the stocks given what's  happened of late. tell me what's top of mind.  >> it's a complex situation. how much has the world changed  since i was last year like a  month ago, but there are two  camps out there and i fall a  little bit on one side of the  camp. there are people who think this  thing is about an inevitable  correction and the market his  recently corrected and i was  watching you earlier that says  this is a run of the mill  correction and you have that  camp and then there is a whole  different camp and this is a  long-term shift in valuations. look, to me, i see this as a  wolf biting ears situation where you have revenue growth and  earnings and tech that create  this enormous valuation, and  then you have the inflation and  the economy and the geopolitical tensions that can't sustain it. ultimately, i think tech  earnings growth will win, but  it's a very complex situation. >> when you look at the  historical averages of p-es  relative to where they are now,  do you look at the space and say even though i believe what you  just said, valuations just got  ahead of themselves or does this all make sense to you relative  to where ai is going? >> it makes sense relative to  where ai is going because you  can't look at p-e alone, you  have to look at earnings growth. you have these big tech  companies doing the type of  earnings kager where you see the p-es all of the time. if you isolate p-es in a  normalized environment, you're  correct, but when you look at  nvidia and the big tech  companies out there they're  growing like wildfire and it's  being fueled by this ai trade. >> what about spending versus  return on that investment? >> yeah. so that's actually a good point, and i was thinking about this  with uber and lyft which i hope  we get a chance to talk about,  as well, but you have to spend. this is from the private markets and we in the venture capital  community care more about  dominating an industry and being the number one or number two  player in the growing industry  where then you can expand and  increase margins and become  profitable later and you want to crush your competitors. right now there is a crush on ai and you can double down on your  particular particular and be the leader of as massive industry,  and i think all of the big tech  companies are spending, but as a publicly traded company, quarter by quarter, is a very delicate  balance.  >> don't you have to get roi? it can't be infinite that you  can't spend until you feel like  it. at some point you can be  rewarded with a return on  investment, no? >> i think we're being rewarded  with the return on investment  and a lot of people don't  realize it is completely  infiltrated our entire world. siri is an ai component that  we've been using for years. so those who don't have ai will  be punished and those who have  it will keep up and those who  lead it will dominate.  >> let's talk about uber and  it's a standout and we can show  the stock that's reacting on the report. what stands out to you about the report? the stock is certainly off its  best levels that it had recently reached in large part because  the prior earnings report was a  surprising negative. >> yeah. so i was an early investor in  lyft, so i've been a lyft fan  from the beginning and i'm  looking at uber, like, now is  the time. i really hope the market gives  lyft enough patience to allow  them to steal a little more  market share from uber and then  lyft can do what uber did which  is increase their prices and  increase their tech rate and  completely flip the switch on  profitability just like uber  did. so uber executed platthe playbo  and they're a dominant player  and they increased their prices  and if you look at uber and lyft right now, you are 30% higher  for the same trip to use uber. no one cares becau

Title: 3Fourteen's Warren Pies says he's fading recession fears and is still in the soft landing camp
Transcript:
close today, rebounding and  trying to recover a good portion of losses from the previous  trading days. my next guest says we haven't  seen the bottom yet, but he's  still finding opportunity for  investors amid this volatility. let's bring in warren pies of  314 research. why do you think we've hit the  bottom? >> that's just what history  says. yesterday at the close we have  an 8.5% correction and we went  back and studied every 10% move  historically going back to 1970s and in general you have a 10%  move and more than a half of  those you go down another 5% on  average. those results get better when  the fed cuts within the next  three months and definitely  better when you don't have a  recession so that kind of leads  me to believe that historically, you would expect maybe we get  down to something like the 4900  level that we saw in the april  lows, but you know, if you'rea  long-term investor and an  intermediate term investor the  upside outweighs the down side  three to one and going out into  the year. >> are you inferring that most  of what you think is the cause  of all of this is the u.s. and  not what's taking place in  japan? >> yeah. i mean, i do think japan  contributed somewhat. it was the spark, but the real  nervousness, and the jitters  that i think that have  surrounded this market over the  last mid-july when we were at  the highs have been a shift from concerns from inflation and the  good news is inflation is dead  as a concern and two concerns  about growth. so now i think everyone is  nervous about a recession and  we've seen serious deterioration of labor statistics and certain  things if you want to be a  recessionista you can point to  and call for recession and i  think that's where the  nervousness is coming from and  then you get the spark that  lights the fuse out in japan. it's a combination and it's the  shift that's behind with those  concerns.  >> there was a softer jobs  report and a still reasonably  strong labor market, wasn't it? >> yeah. to me, i don't see it. i don't see recession. i think that the fears are  overblown. that's the big takeaway for us  is that if the fed is on an  easing path which they are and  everyone agrees on that now, and you don't see a recession in our framework and our recession  framework looks at the housing  market and construction jobs,  remember the job loss defines a  recession and the average  recession and construction job  loss makes up in the u.s. even  though they make up less than  5%. you need to get the cyclical  parts rolling over to get a true recession and you don't see any  kind of signs right now of  serious layoffs in the  residential construction payroll segment or anything in the  construction segment. so in my view. no recession, yeah, i get  there's some nervousness and  we're seeing breadth deteriorate and ultimately, i'm fading those recession fears and i'm still in the soft landing camp, i guess.  >> if that's the case, what's  become most attractive relative  to the dislocation we saw over  the past few days and because of fears about the economy going  into a recession? >> yeah. i think there was a big -- we  talked about this, i think, you  and i earlier about this  drumbeat for buying small caps  and it really confused me. this is a late-cycle  environment. what we are debating is whether  or not we go into recession and  this is not a situation where we are emerging from a recession or a serious bear market, and so  you don't want to be in low  quality. you don't want to be in small  caps. you don't want to be in  cyclicals, and so that leads you into by process of elimination  to high-quality stocks. i think you also want to shade  away from mag 7 so you have a  high quality, nonmag 7 area and  that's what we're focusing on in the quality group and our  research is focused heavily on  quality at this point in the  cycle and what you can do is buy dips and for instance, our fund  was buying housing related  stocks in july because those are high-quality stocks in the  pullback and we rotated a lot of those gains into some of these  tech-type stoc

today. palantir up, and caterpillar  having a nice move, as well and  takes us to the talk of the  tape. ismore volatility ahead for  stocks. is the worst, in fact, over? let's welcome adam parker and  the founder of trivariant  research and cnbc contributor. good to have youio here.  >> good to be here.  >> especially after what's  happened over the last 24 hours. what is this? >> i was joking when i was off  air, after things happen you  think it's japanese carry trade  and you never hear about it  before it happens. i know we talked a couple of  weeks about that the financials  were tightening a bit and we  talked about it last week on the air, so i think some of those  things were knowable and the  earnings season was more than  people thought and you can point to fundamental things and you  can get an unwind when people  get nervous. is the bottom in? probably not and you get a few  more bad days than just this. it happened fast, but i think  it's a little bit premature to  say i'm back in with two feet  and i'm excited that the  bottom's in. >> you think that this unwinding of the carry trade which got a  lot of attention yesterday i  think has gotten most of the  blame for the kind of volatility that we saw. by the way, have you ever seen  yesterday morning when you get  the vix spiking by 100%. there was a lot of fear in this  market yesterday. >> we were talking at  trivariant, i've seen my scares  and this is the last that we've  seen in the last 20 years and it fell sharp or vix and fell  sharper on financial conditions  which nosediveded and when did   last get on the metrics? it's covid and it's definitely  not 2008 and there are kernells  of truth that are eroding and i  still think earnings will grow  in 2025 and 2024. i'm not panicked and i'm trying  to think what do i like that i  can get that's cheaper now, and  i'm trying to figure out how to  get more offensive as opposed to just hitting the panic button. >> david solomon's on the tape  here and giving an interview and said no recession, the  correction in the stock market,  quote, might be healthy. sees no emergency cut from the  federal reserve either. there are many notes out today  saying no imminent recession. that's hsbc. barclays with the jobs report  last friday which got everybody  worked up, just one print. what do you make of all that? >> i'm inclined to think that  while things are slowing they're not falling off the cliff. i was surprised to see siegel  come on ---er is me siegel say  we need 75 emergency cuts and  that seemed a little extreme to  me based on what i'm seeing from the data. i'm seeing enough corporates  that you talk about uber and  there are enough things going  okay for big-dollar companies  and i'm not seeing some  implosion and i see some eroding in the consumer and we saw  verticals and auto, housing,  retail restaurants to be more  concerned and the sell side  estimates are too high. they have to come a notch, maybe two notches lower and i don't  think it's, like, hit the panic  button and it's, like, let's  turtle up. >> of those that were calm, cool and checked was rick reader of  blackrock, and he said, look,  this presents a pretty good  opportunity. i want you to listen to what he  said yesterday and most  importantly what he was doing  and looking at. >> part of what makes this an  interesting market is there's  some stuff to do. there are some things to trade  because markets are overshooting in a bun ch of places and you  look at the move today, there  are opportunities across these  markets where we're seeing in  extreme moves and taking  advantage. by the way, i see the same thing on the equity market. i mean, some of the names that  have reported good earnings and  buying back their stock that are down mid-to-high single digits  and there are opportunities some of those, as well.  >> that's rick rieder. do you think we'll look back at  this and say that was a great  buying opportunity yesterday  with a lot of different things? >> i'm inclined to agree with  him that it will present some  opportunities and it's just in  the past when i see this  volatility it shally has a few  big up days like today and a few down days before it's totally  over. i don't think it's a clearing e  rent and you say this is 10%,  20% cheaper like semis that have gotten annihilated and i don't  think the fundamentals are great r. the video is down -- things are  down a lot from the peak and  ma

and many more.  >> we'll talk to the ceo of  reddit and rivian before the  calls with wall street analysts  and let's bring in adam  krisafuly. adam, it's not exactly great if  you're bullish to see the s&p  close up just a percent after  the stronger rally during the  day. what do you make of it? >> yeah. so i think what happened over  the last several days has  certainly inflicted a lot of  psychological damage and it will be a process that will take some time. the markets will want to see  stability over the course of  several days going forward and  not a single, sharp, v-shaped  rally and we'll have a series of more modest gains rather than a  giant v-shaped moving in a  single session. it's more of a process than  recession, and we'll have to  kind of sift through some more  earnings and get more economic  data and hear from more fed  officials to get a better sense  of where it lies right now. sorry, go ahead? >> which matters more right now? the earnings and the micro that  we're getting, perhaps the  consumer read or the macro data? >> i think it's a little mixture of both? i think we've had a report in  the last 12 hours that were  somewhat encouraging,  caterpillar, csx, yum brands and some of the brands with big  footprints in the economy. the biggest them in this season  are companies having costs to  offset revenues to drive margins and earnings and corporate  america is evolving in response  to it and they're generating  healthy earnings. it certainly reflections the  employment momentum and we'll  have to watch it closely, and  still the economy is not  collapsing by any means. the service size yesterday was  healthet and atlanta fed  yesterday updated its gdp  forecast up 12%. i think the economies that are  reasonably sound and the  rate-cutting process will start  in about a month or so, probably not 50 basis points on what they received and 25 basis points a

Title: Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe: There's still a lot of demand on the sideline for EVs
Transcript:
those shares are falling despite beating revenue estimates and  posting a smaller than expected  loss in the second-quarter  results, down 4.5% and joiningis right now is r.j. scaringe along with our own phil lebeau. phil? >> thank you, morgan. r.j., let's start off with the  second quarter. smaller than expected loss. what are you noticing in terms  of demand for your evs in the  market? >> yeah. we -- as you saw for the second  quarter our production was down. we made some changes to update  the vehicle for our 10-2  vehicles, but sales exceeded  what we used because we  continued to sell through the  gen 1 inventory. we saw j.d. power list this as  the number one brand in their  annual appeals study. so we'll continue to see the  product and certainly working to get more of those generation 2  vehicles in customer standings. >> r.j., you are in the quarter  with over $9 billion in  liquidity and that includes the  deal you made in the quarter and you have another 4 billion on  the way. is that enough to get you  through production in 2026? >> we talked about this in the  past. for us, the launch of r2s is  really critical. it gives us a product that  really allows us to access the  customer that's more price  sensitive to get us to the  sub-$50,000 price point and the  financing that we have in place  not only takes us through the  launch, but also takes us  through positive cash flow. >> it's great to have you on. i have an entire packet here of  analyst notes, analyst  questions. lots of them. wall street wants to know more  about this vw partnership, what  this looks like, why it's  important, why it's happening  now, the details around it and  how it's going to change the  competitive landscape for  rivian? >> this is something that we've  certainly been at work at for a  while and it really demonstrates the strength of the platform  that we built. the electronic stack and the  associated network architecture  and of course, the software  that's running on it and we are  really excited about the  opportunity to take that  platform twan our electronics  and our software and apply them  to a global basis to a lot more  products and to have that help  drive the transition toward  electric vehicles.  >> r.j., what do you see as the  impact of perhaps a slowing  consumer. is your customer so high end and the market share in a position  that you don't think it has an  effect on you or does it make  the availability of more  affordable options more  important? >> i think it's hard to predict  exactly what happens from a  macro point of view. certainly, we are watching it  very closely, but as it pertains to our flagship product in r1 it continues to be one of the  best-selling vehicles over  $70,000. we see that continue to be the  case, and the excitement around  the product and what it offers  remain, but very importantly for us is r2 and it represents an  opportunity for a step change in volume as something that is a  price point starting at $45,000  and that segment really has very little choice. there is a lack of products for  customers to choose from. they're thinking about  electrification, and we believe  there is a lot of latent demand  and they continue to buy for  hybrid vehicles and it doesn't  change their vehicle packages.  >> r.j., one last question. you lost 32,500 per vehicle that you delivered in the second  quarter and you still have a  modest positive growth profit in the second are the quarter. how do you get there? >> the move from the first  generation to the  second-generation vehicle it was par better than that we produced in gen-1. apparently it drove significant  cost improvements into the  vehicle and both because of the  changes in the way the vehicle  is built and also how we have  for the numbers and what we see  with the q2 members doesn't have anything in them and it has  rough low a third of our  quarter, our plant and our  production came down and as we  made significant changeses in  improving in e fesh enzi. you'll see the structure and of  co

Transcript:
♪ >>> welcome back. airbnb shares are sinking after  issuing a light revenue guide  and missing on the bottom line. instacart is jumping after  beating on revenue and earnings. joining us now is needham senior analyst bernie mcchurnan. i have to start with airbnb and  it's up about 12% right now. the weak guide especially given  the fact that we have olympics  and summer travel. what do you make of it? >> yeah. i think this is the peak travel  season that investors had been  bracing for for two years now,  and i think that's what you're  seeing. airbnb, whether that was booking was talking about the same thing last week and what the airlines  were talking about before and  it's weakness in the top line  and this is why there's such a  focus for airbnb to move beyond  the core and whether they be  sponsored listings by ai and ota as an ability to try to go from  a high single-digit or low  double-digit grow, and they'll  grow for some time now. it's really the difference  between what we see from uber,  doordash or instacart reporting  after the close. this convenience economy that's  increasingly taking consumer  wallet share relative to travel  which seems like they were and  they were on the other side of  that. >> we saw this differentiation  between goods and services and  now as consumers, seem to be  tightening their belts further. it is digging down deeper on to  the services side and they're  w willing to spend on things like  uber and it would seem like  instacart and doordash and not  so much for travel anymore. how does that speak to the  spending flows and where the  dollars are going and why? >> why? i remember a quote from an  analyst that never think  differently than you inherently  see it with the, and you watch  hours and hours a day or it's  just so much better or easier  consumer propositions, so i  think that's still what people  are willing to spend on here and the ability for let's talk about uber or door dash to continue to grow from here. it is dominated by power users  and it's 30% of the users are  driving 70% of the bookings for  these types of platforms and the ability to convert to a weekly  user into a daily user and all  the while eking out pens per  trip and delivery and these  businesses are executing  strongly. >> quickly, if you can. what does it mean that consumers and airbnb consumers are waiting later to actually make the  booking? >> yeah. well, no, it's demand, right? and so there used to be a rush  where you had to book six months out, nine months out because  there was a limited supply. that's something that airbnb has been focused on in terms of the  supply and last year supply grew ahead of bookings and you need  the dema

reddit shares are under pressure despite beating wall street  estimates on the top and bottom  line and daily active users. joining us is an exclusive  interview is reddit co-founder  steve huffman with our julia  boorstin. >> thanks, jon. thanks, steve, for joining us. we really appreciate it. the stock is down nearly 5% in  after-hours trading despite  beating on every single metric. the stock is under pressure  because despite your fast growth both in terms of revenue and in  terms of users, average revenue  grew 2% and average revenue per  u user declined by 5%. how do you address the concerns  that raises about the long-term  potential for the company.  >> hi, julia. thanks for having me. >> look, i think we had a really strong quarter. we were up over 50% on users and 50% on revenue. $39 million adjusted ebitda, and we're getting closer and closer  to that gap profitability  milestone. long story short, i think we're  really proud of the progress  we've made growing this  business. our work is working, and i think we're finding that users truly  crave what reddit, the content  that we have on reddit and  increasingly growing our  customer base and more and more  happy customers. i can't always explain the  short-term, but over the  long-term our work is working  and the product got had a great  look into the market. >> digging into the think resume per user numbers that you think  impact the quarter and help us  understand the discrepancy here  and the fact that you actually  saw a decline in the u.s.  >> the biggest drivers there was growing users in the united  states. it was -- i ngthink we grew ove  70% in the u.s. last quarter and average revenue per user, when  users grow that's the bottom  half of that formula. so, look, i think the top line  numbers speak for themselves. growing users significantly year over year and revenue  significantly year over year. sometimes users outpace revenue  a little bit and sometimes  revenue outpaces users, but  we'll take the strong user  growth and strong revenue growth any quarter. >> steve. it's jon. thank for joining us. to what degree are you going to  make the higher end more premium pitch to advertisers and how  much is the granularity of data  that you have on user interests  going aid that? >> so we actually believe that  reddit is a fit for customers  large and small. every company's customers are on reddit were some because reddit  has communities for whatever  you're into, whatever you're  thinking about watching,  wearing, doing, going, whatever  you're going through and so as a result of the vast coverage of  our content, pretty much every  company's customers are reddit  users somewhere, and so i think  this makes reddit a natural fit  for both, the big brand  advertisers and also we can  drive performance because reddit is a place where people make  decisions about what they're  going to buy or do next, and  that's a very power frl session  am. 30% of our uses and so  advertisers can uniquely find  their customers on reddit in a  way they can't potentially  anywhere else.  >> that's a fascinate nate  metric. >> thank you very much. you have launched your contact  to alphabet ai and a deal. >> they're a major deal and  having those partnerships allows us to collaborate, i think going and exciting products for the  future as the search and ai  landscape continues to evolve. >> it's a brand-new market. we're talking to lots of players big and small and it's really  evolving before our eyes, and i  think we're off to a great start and more to come there for sure. >> so a question related to that is when you expect those  partnerships with the deal that  you're making with open ai to  access data and to effectively  change and trade chatgpt, when  do you expect that to impact  your revenue and at the same  time, you've been battling with  microsoft preventing them from  accessing your site. when do you expect to strike a  deal with them or figure out  where that relationship goes  next? >> look. we are recognizing the revenue  in the current agreements today, and they are now consumers for  reddit data. those deals are in play and the  product work is ongoing and  that's where the other players  in the ecosystem. look, we like to -- we like the  reddit content being out there. it's a totally unique purpose  and there is no artificial  intelligence without actual  intelligence and reddit has an  incredible supply that covers  pretty much everything and  anything. reddit has historically been the most open of the platforms of  our kind, and we still really  are, and so we like reddit being out there, but we have terms  that are really important to us  in this new world to protect  user privacy, to protect our  content and so we need to make  sure that if our content, if  reddit data will be out there,  and it comes with some  constraints and so those are the sort of things we ask for, and  so the

Title: No emergency rate cut ahead because economy isn't that bad, says KBW CEO Tom Michaud

that seems the most likely path  for sure. that used to be positive for  stocks. i think it could be again.  >> we will continue this  conversation because if you're  trying to figure out where the  macro economy is going or maybe  what the fed is going to do you  want to look at the banks. banks know a lot about things,  loan demand, credit availability and few companies know as much  about banks as kbw. a 62-year-old investment bank  focused on financials. tommy show is the ceo of kbw. great to have you on. an important conversation.  >> yes.  >> everybody is going to be  waiting for this fed easing  cycle, but it looks like the  bond market has kind of already  done the job of the fed for it. >> yes. well, the first thing is i would watch the yield curve and the  shape of the yield curve. we're watching it very carefully for the banks. this past week we had the twos,  tens stop being inverted for a  short period of time, the  longest period of time in 47  years that that yield curve had  been inverted. the one that matters most for  the banks still a little  inverted that's the three month  five year that's the longest  inversion in close to 70 years.  >> wow. i sorry, what does that mean in  plain language? whenever i hear the first time  in 70 years you got my  attention.  >> here is what it is is the  biggest component of bank  earnings is net interest income  which they earn on the spread. when the yield curve is  inverted, assume these banks are operating with a big headwind  blowing at them. it's a hard market when that  happens. when you get a more -- when you  get a flatter or a  regular-shaped yield curve that  means banks can, you know, can  borrow short and lend a little  longer and take advantage of  that duration. so banks have been operating in  a very hostile environment. if you were to say to me in  general what's a tough  environment for banks? i'd say inverted yield curve  after interest rates just went  up a lot. that's just what happened. they are actually about to catch a break. we believe that the low quarter  fournette interest income the  biggest component of bank  revenue and earnings was in the  second quarter that just passed. now it's going to start getting  better and it's going to get  better slowly but it's going to  get better.  >> this asset class, though, has had an enormous run, it's as if  the market has anticipated this  but there is a lot of different  things that have been triggers  for banks. a lot is less regulatory  pressure, dynamics around this,  there's certainly -- we're well  past the svb headaches of 15  months ago. is it a credit story that i  think people have a lot more  confidence in banks? because it seems that the one  brain cell is commercial real  estate, gets a little bit more  of a lifeline where the fed is  easing back off, but either way  the presumption was there was a  lot of credit risk out there for banks and we are just not  getting it.  >> the credit story has been far better than everybody expected  and everybody has been waiting  for a shoe to drop. the shoe hasn't dropped. not only is credit not getting  away from the industry, credit  is still better than average  right now. we have not seen -- we haven't  even gotten back to normal. we are still better than normal. last week we had 100 banks in  new york for a conference, we  followed all the bank earnings  in the second quarter. they as a group said nothing  that makes you think we're going to get a harder landing. as far as we see from our lens,  soft landing still seems to be  what's going to happen.  >> but what happened friday and  yesterday, then? you know, i know some of your  traders. what are they saying to you  about what the heck --  >> well, i was listening to your conversation. there's a delinkage between  macro forces and it scares  everybody, but the reality is it didn't affect the real economy  yet in the united states. i mean, there is a story of a  slowing economy. that's what the fed is trying to do, and they will eventually win because the fed usually does. so the economy is slowing, but  we're nowhere near crisis in m

Title: Volatility measures soar as investors price in downside risk

money." the vix pulling back today after hitting its highest level since  april of 2020 on monday almost  hit 100, but your next guest  says volatility is a big risk  across nearly every asset class. cebo head of derivatives,  joining us now. can you first explain, mandy,  why did we go from a 16 vix to  an 86 vix because the job market missed and there's some carry  trade problems.  >> yeah, so i would separate  what we saw on friday versus  what we saw on monday, i think  there's two distinct stories  going on. friday clearly was a macro  fundamental driven move on the  market based on a weak u.s.  payroll. maybe the recession trade was  overdone, but what we saw monday i would say was completely  divorced from fundamentals, it  was pure positioning. you can tell because on friday  the spike in volatility we saw  we saw in u.s. markets n  european markets across regions. the price action we saw monday  was primarily japan and u.s.  tech. so the most crowded names.  >> i know we call it the fear  gauge.  >> yes.  >> but it's really a measure of  options movement, right? >> correct.  >> and sprids and things like  that. but yet if there's -- we have a  lot of stuff going on with iran, it's a very scary time in the  middle east. that's what i think of the vix  as being. can you dig more into why did  the price and market action  cause the, quote, unquote, fear  gauge to rise like that? >> sure. part of it is in the fact nat  underlying s&p index started  moving a lot, pre open and on  monday --  >> blew out options spreads? >> so going forward there's  expectation that the volatility  could persist. so the forward looking option  pricing is embedding more  volatility but on top of that  the vix also measures relative  demands for puts versus calls  and what we saw over the past  two days is a significant  increase in hedging demand and  put demand and that left tail  which traders for the past year  have neglected, everyone has  been focused on the upside of  the market that left tail coming back into play explains a big  part in the rise in the vix.  >> a lot of people have embraced this sell volunteering ilt  trade, you get paid to sell vol, the market never goes down, they earn a premium, they're fine. that has a life span. to a certain extent we saw the  flip side of what could happen  when you're short val tilt over  the past few days.  >> when people talk about sell  short vol trades they're talking about option income trades,  people who are selling call  options for income for their  portfolio. that is not a short vol trade,  that's an income generating  trade and i say that because  those trades there's no embedded leverage.  >> true.  >> monday was all about a  deleveraging event a positioning washout for people. if you were just an investor who sold a call on top of a stock  that you owned or your equity  portfolio you did great. you didn't do great on the  equity portion but collected  that premium. the option portion is not what  was using your money. i would differentiate that. that's the growth we have seen  in the options market is on  that, it's more conservative  strategies that are not levered. i don't think in my opinion that was not what the catalyst or the center of the storm.  >> so you talk about the skew  towards puts changing can you  give us some context where that  is now and where it was at the  low and where you think it might go also.  >> sure. i would say the theme over the  past two years in the lead up to this past week has been  incredibly low skew in the  options market particularly for  s&p index options meaning into  demand for puts and everyone is  chasing the upside. that's something we have  highlighted for a while. now that's reversed sharply to  levels basically we haven't seen since covid. i think that's a function of  people waking up and realizing,  a, recession is back, recession  fear is back, but also just this unknown, unknown about how --  like what positioning unwind is  left in the market, how much  unwind --  >> how much do you think, mandy? >> i can tell you again -- what  i can tell you if you look at  the fx market, volatility for  dollar yen it has not come down  much as well. the vix retraced quite a  business of its move from  monday, not in the fx market. people are pricing in continued  volatility going forward which  would suggest potentially we  could see more --  >> karen, you said at the top of the sh
