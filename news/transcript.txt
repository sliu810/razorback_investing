<div><strong>Title:</strong> Uber announces partnership with Cruise to offer driverless rides<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> evacuations. dom, back to you >> thank you very much, kate rogers for the news update there. >>> uber is teaming up with gm's cruise as it looks to expand driverless rides this comes as a crucial time for the autonomous vehicle company as it looks to requme  operations deidre bosa has more in today's  "tech check. good afternoon, dei. >> that's right, critical time for cruise, and that may be why  uber shares fell on the  announcement cruise is a very complicated partner. in addition to what you just mentioned, it recalled 1200 robo taxis over a heartbreaking issue following an incident here in  san francisco where one of its robo taxis dragged a pedestrian. some are saying some of that cruise stigma rubs off on uber shares are recovering, but cruise is far from the only  autonomous driver uber has signed up with they said -- >> so we'll be on the lookout  for that i want to say overall, this is very different than the approach that the uber co-founder believed was critical. travis callinick wanted to develop driverless technology in house, and if he didn't, they  said they would face an  existential threat from the wamo and cruises of the world so this is a real departure. they chose instead to partner, which is a much, much cheaper  way to go about this but dom, i've been riding a ton  of wamo robo taxis in san  francisco. you do not go through the uber app like you do if you were to hail a ride share in phoenix,  for example. so you can see a world in which  wamo takes out the middleman,  takes out uber that's one of the bear cases against the ride sharing platforms, is that they could  ultimately be squeezed out if  robo taxis take off. >> it wasn't as fancy or as  forceful and momentum driven as  the ai trade, but autonomous driving and robotics was a massive theme not long ago what exactly was the main  reason, in your mind, why the  momentum has just really slowed  down for this particular story around autonomous riding and taxis? >> i think it's so interconnected with the ai trade, right it uses a lot of the same  technology google has been developing this  for a long time. they happen to be leaders in generative ai. there's a lot of overlap, so it's just a coming back down to  earth, realizing that  montization, revenue, that's still far away we're still in the early innings. and while we're there, this is going to be ve<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Market is 'getting ahead of itself' by pricing in aggressive cuts, says Raymond James' Orton<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> thank you very much. we'll talk to you soon have a nice weekend, jay >> you too, dom. >>> so our next guest now thinks the market is getting ahead of itself by counting on aggressive rate cuts. he sees more volatility ahead of that september meeting, and he's ready to deploy cash on the  pullbacks in thalias in  particular so joining us now for more on  that story is matt orton, chief  market strategist at raymond james financial. if you look at what we just  heard from jay with regard to  the reasons why he thinks that the fed needs to cut by a half,  a half, a quarter, all by the  end of december, it seems  interesting that there is a  divergent view strongly from your side why that should not  happen why the view there >> yeah. hey, dom, great to see you two sides always make a market,  right? while i don't disagree with any  of the points that he made with  respect to where we are on the economy, when i look at the  totality of the data to steal a  term from jay powell, i just don't see a tremendous amount of weakness in the labor market that exists today. when i talked to corporate management teams and travel  around the country for client  meetings, i don't get the sense, and i don't see mass layoffs that are going to come when you look historically, you  just don't see significant layoffs and big cracks opening up to the fissures in the labor  market when you have profit at 12.2%, the highest since one quarter in 2021. so when you put that all together, coupled with the fact  that we're still seeing earnings growth, we still have a healthy  corporate sector, the need for more than a 25 basis point cut,  i just don't think is there. and then there's also the  signaling that has with the  respect to the rest to have  economy and having other market  participants ask, are we missing something in this? so i just don't think that there is a need to go more than 25 basis points i think it's going to be part of a gradual cutting cycle. unless, of course, the data  dictates otherwise >> matt, it's interesting you  bring that up, because the number of traders and investors  i have spoken to, we talk about  this idea that there is still  decently robust earnings growth  amidst this backdrop that at one point this summer, 59% of  americans say we're in a recession. it doesn't justify it, it  doesn't justify the kind of  valuations that we have. i say this because the dow and the s&p are now just a stone's throw away from the record high  levels we saw earlier this summer how exactly then do things play  out in the coming moments, knowing that's the setup going into the fall? >> dom, i get that asked a lot by clients i was just at an event last  night where we were talking  about this the message i give to our  clients is that when you have  valuations where they are, where the market is, you know, priced  to perfectionin some parts of  it, there's still a lot of the average stocks that have not participated in this rally so  far this year. so mega caps, even though they have been weaker over the past month, month and a half, they  have dominated a lot of the pe multiple expansion, whereas your average stock, say the equal weighted s&p 500, is still trading at average valuations  over the past 20, 30 years and that's where i'm looking for a lot of opportunity, where am i seeing a broadening of earnings  growth finally starting to translate into price appreciation that's where you start to look for tangential plays on  artificial intelligence, where you're seeing montization on a lot of these themes and playing  on misperceptions oh of a weak consumer there's still pockets of strength, and it's about leaning into those different themes, where the stocks are not at all  yet priced fully >> matt, because you opened the  door, i'm going to walk through  it let's take us through the picks, the overall favorite ideas that  you have given that set of context. >> so, dom, i think you alluded  to it earlier. i think one of the most  important baskets i've been  talking about is artificial  intelligence 2.0 so a lot of the main plays,  nvidias, microsofts of the world, not to say that there isn't still value or still price appreciation potential there,  but when you peel back the onion and look at where a lot of that  cap ex from the hyper scalers is going to be spent, a lot is not  just going to be spent in the  semiconductor space, but on  powering the data centers that are being built. it's actually on building the  physical data centers, and it's  on the wiring, all the connectivity that makes it possible so i've been looking a lot at  electrical equipment companies,  companies that are providing the cooling solutions to the data  centers. they have been strong  performers, they have pulled back, so it's a great time to  deploy more capital into some of those names. when you look at some of the industrial names, maybe some machinery names that are building the data centers, there's a lot of earnings  momentum that you are starting to see pick up in that part of the market, too. and then you look at utilities you know, actually bringing the  power to the data centers is a huge, huge problem there's just not enough of it. so there's probably going to be  trillions of dollars invested  over the next three to five  years in building out and  modernizing our grid so it's about finding the  winners within that space of who is actually going to be getting  a lot of those federal and private dollars to build out what we need to make ai a  reality. >> all right so the top picks there,  alphabet, vertiv h<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Fed will ease by one-and-a-quarter percent by end of year, says Wells Fargo's Bryson<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> data and the committee >> the time has come those words. thank you very much, steve liesman, out in jackson hole >>> while jay powell did not indicate the scope of those rate cuts, our next guest expects the fed to ease by a full half percent in september and november, and a quarter point in december 1.25% by the end of the year joining me is jay bryson from  wells fargo. that's a little more aggressive  than most of the people i have spoken to say. why do you think the case is there for a full percent split the next two meetings of cuts? >> you know, dom, what i would say is, and mr. powell kind of alluded to this today, the labor market is starting to weaken,  inflation is coming back down  towards 2% and generally, what it really  boils down to is the stance of monetary policy right now is very restrictive you know, we measure that by the so-called real fed funds rate. the nominal rate minus inflation. and that's close to 3% right now. we haven't been at these sorts of levels since 2007 and so, they have a lot of wood  to chop, just to get back to neutral, and they kind of need to get going back in that  direction as the economy continues to show some signs of  stress >> as an economist, has it surprised you at all you've seen many of these  cycles, you still look young enough, but we know that you're  a veteran and you have seen a  lot of these cycles. it's shattering to my mind how quickly we went from being all fearful of 40 plus year  inflation levels to being  concerned about a weakening job  market and slowing economy to  the point where you think the  fed would have to cut by a full  half percent to kick off a cycle possibly >> so, dom, you know, i will go  back a few decades here. if you go back to november of  2000, in november of 2000, the fed had a "bias to tighten." in december, they moved to a neutral bias, and on january 2,  2001, they cut rates by 50 basis points sometimes that's the way the economy works. sometimes it deteriorates  quickly, and when you think back to 2002, when inflation really shot up, you know, inflation shot up really quickly and the fed had to move really fast. so what's more likely when you look at history is the fed funds rate tends to move a lot in a  direction rather than going 25 basis points, waiting a meeting  or two, going another 25 basis points the big swings are more normal >> how much does the fed this  time around have to factor not just those things we mentioned with regard to the kind of downdraft of inflation and the slowing economic jobs growth picture, juxtaposed against an election that might, in some people's minds, create an  economic policy variability and  volatility how much does that factor into the fed's anticipated decision in just a few weeks' time? >> so, you know, nobody really obviously know what's going to happen with the presidential election, we'll start there, but even the congressional election. so even if you can make  assumptions there and some sort  of forecast, those things won't  come into play until the middle  part of 2025 probably at the earliest and so, you know, what the fed has to be doing right now is looking at the incoming sort of  data what is that saying about the  economy? the politics behind it is a  little bit of background noise once the smoke from the election clears and they have a better  sense of what sort of policy changes may be coming from the new administration from capitol  hill, then they can start to adjust their policy guidance at  that point but right now, they've got to be laser focused on what's really happening in the economy >> jay bryson with a call <br>

swift we got governor roy cooper introducing harris and some policy and some republicans well if mittens had been you know take take them and don't call it price controls harris's potential ban on price gouging had its start in legislation proposed by massachusetts senator elizabeth warren in the same way that the ftc for example has tools to be able to deal with deceptive pricing uh and deceptive uh advertising it should have the ability to deal with price gouging she joins us for a spirited debate on inflated prices did you invite me on here just a lecture to me no i just want to ask you point is to get markets that are more competitive plus there are taco bell people and there's chipotle people and cava people the fast casual mediterranean chains leader on taking on the big guys our uh growth plan is 1,000 restaurants by 2032 three times as many as you have now but still only a third of what chipotle has roughly yeah it's friday august 23rd squawk pod begins right now stand by in 3 2 one c please good friday morning and welcome to squawkbox here on cnbc we're live from the nasdaq market site in time square i'm kelly evans along with joe kernin becky and andrew are off today that is green it is brat green it's a beautiful green thank you i already had an argument in make over what color is it kelly green i mean no by definition today it's kelly green but is that the actual shade of green that's referred to is kelly no this is like more neon more of a neon green it's like cnbc green i think it's money green money green cuz we got we're going to talk all about the guy who prints all the money uh we are that's right it's in honor of pal did you think about any of this not really i was really thinking there's you know the brat meme that's been going around all summer i' i'm not much aware but i'm enough aware these so the summer's almost over and i thought well i maybe if you're going to do it if you're going to do it can't do that in like november no i don't think so we will create what i call an opportunity economy an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed vice president kla harris accepted her party's nomination for president last night at the democratic convention in chicago megan castell is there she joins us with the highlights and megan i i couldn't quite tell from the so there was no surprise guest after all that after all that discussion of a surprise guest was it going to be beyonce was it going to be taylor swift we got governor roy cooper introducing kamla harris but it wasn't quite the fan fair that everybody was expecting but good morning kelly from downtown chicago we're just a few miles away from that united center where folks are already breaking down after that fourth and final night last night but despite no surprise guess the energy last night was as high as any night that we had seen it this week there were still some celebrities in attendance the chicks performed the national anthem carrie washington was the celebrity host mc and pink performed on stage with her daughter as well we also heard from a range of elected officials all the way from senator elizabeth warren on the left she teared up as she got a standing ovation you know what i love best about kamla harris kamla harris can't be bought and she can't be bossed around to former congressman adam kininger on the right a republican member of congress i know comma harris shares my allegiance to the rule of law the constitution and democracy and she is dedicated to help old upholding all three in service to our country whatever policies we disagree on pale in comparison with those fundamental matters of principle of decency and of fidelity to this nation but of course the spotlight for the evening was on vice president harris herself she was formally accepting that nomination and she used her acceptance speech to once again introduce herself to the american people she focused a lot on her record especially her record before she got to washington a part that most people aren't as familiar with take a listen to this i took on the big banks delivered $2 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeown owner bill of rights one of the first of its kind in the nation now harris also spoke about growing up as part of a middle class family and she used that biography to connect to the policy agenda which last night she was calling quote a new way forward she was also looking to strike a contrast between her vision and that that we've seen from former president trump listen to this he intends to enact what in effect is a national sales tax call it a trump tax that would raise prices on middle class families by almost $44,000 a year well instead of a trump tax hike we will pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million americans now for a speech that was always expected to be light on policy details we did hear harris touch on a number of different issues she spoke about nato and ukraine she talked about china and the need for the us to be a global leader on artificial intelligence and nbc news did talk with her just briefly after her speech madam vice president how do you feel tonight feel good now on to tomorrow good to see you last night yeah congratulations to you it was sort of a nod to just how much work democrats feel that they have left to do between now and november and now guys one last point we were hearing from former president trump throughout the evening last night he was live posting on truth social as harris was speaking he was accusing harris of quote gaslighting america and he did question that why for all of her policy ideas right now he's asking why she wasn't implementing these in the 3 and a half years that she's been vice president guys and from what i heard megan she did she also defend israel's right to defend itself how did that part of the speech go over she touched on israel and gaza and it is interesting this was supposed to be a hot button issue this week there were protests every day over gaza but it wasn't nearly what anybody expected and so that part of the speech did go through she spoke about that policy a that foreign policy agenda which i think was a surprise to most people people really did accept in the arena and it was just part of something i heard a lot of commentary in real time of folks saying you know for someone who doesn't have much foreign policy experience at all she's been a lawyer her career a prosecutor she doesn't have much foreign policy experience but she dove into those details and i heard uh commentary from folks like ben rhods the obama administration official focused on foreign policy saying this is someone who seemed ready to be president right now i think she was seeking to make that point all right megan appreciate it this morning uh megan cassella in chicago if you have a um truly do have a surprise guess you don't you try to get the so what do you do with the rumors going around it probably boosted ratings don't you think yeah but you try to build up the idea you do did you hear who they were the i mean people kept saying beyonce was going to show up no no don lemon i mean why i never thought i'd say that was my i never thought i'd say those two words together but don lemon um the rumors were taylor swift was the big one was never going to happen because michael jordan republic no not romne was my point was that that taylor swift has a lot of fans michael jordan said republicans bu sneakers too if taylor swift taylor swift doesn't need any more fans obviously but i don't i don't think you'd want to alienate and then mitt romney i don't know he belongs there probably that that would have been fine that would i heard george w bush and he would never he would never do that he hasn't said a word since he left but people did use that to make the point oh he wasn't at the rnc oh all the former presidents were because of low energy jeb it's never going to happen the bushes hate him bill crystal hates him all the lincoln project hates him we know who hates him you know who doesn't hate him adam kininger you know who's not from the right as we just heard adam kininger all right all i know is that i think the rumor they used as a convenient way to drive a wedge between look at one party who's able to show unity and the other who can't you know that's well if mittens had been you know take take him uh late yesterday robert f kennedy jr uh withdrew from the ballot in arizona and multiple reports say kennedy will announce today that he's withdrawing for the presidential race i don't know whether he's endorsing donald trump supposedly don jr and tucker carlson have been working on him to make that happen but is that why po market's not coming coming off the highs and just listening to trump yesterday he said i don't know whether he he went to great lengths not to build up expectations that that was coming robert f kenny is married to cheryl hines no no robert f kenny is married i i don't expect you to no from kirby your enthusiasm robert kenny is married to cheryl hind she's already on the record saying he knows how i feel and there's conjecture around that that would never happen you know how an anti-trump she is but all i know is if that was a reason why trump's winning odds had gone up to what 3 they're down to 5 knows why they were up could be that could be the dnc could be some of the some of the policies that i'm sure that i think was part of why but i mean they're now he still might he right he still might uh well that that he was ahead at all on polymer during the dnc a 10o shift was very strange was very strange but uh kennedy scheduled to speak today in phoenix are like in the same state uh then hours later trump is holding a rally in neighboring glendale close trump's campaign said yesterday today that he would be joined by a special guest at here we go again if there's not a real special if don't do this to us two days in going to be a special gu i guess specials if than surise it might be beyonce it'd be more likely to be beyonce than mitt romney to join trump which shows how unlikely it but whether rfk jr and you wonder what kind of uh what he's being offered well that's the thing if you i mean who which voter is going to go what position is he going to hold that labor department no i i'm i don't know what just because it's so a symetrical and it would be amazing as ag like his father his father was attorney general do you know that right i mean we now i you know te will be next coming up on squawk pod this is the way you never lose an argument because no one can ever say anything back to you senator a lively discussion with senator elizabeth warren who's defending and explaining one headline making part of vice president harris's economic agenda preventing price gouging at the federal level where have you been for the last 30 years uh as three dozen states have price gouging laws and they have used them effectively states like texas and florida you don't want to miss this well welcome back this is squawk pod from cnbc today with joe kernin and kelly evans here's joe the harris campaign has yet to give specifics on the vice president's plan to uh ban price gouging or actually uh put on some price controls basically but our next guest uh worked with harris on an anti-price gouging bill in 2020 uh during the pandemic a similar bill was reintroduced in the senate earlier this year joining us now massachusetts democratic senator elizabeth warren um senator you're famous from last night oh you already famous but you're even more famous from last night um kind of a a pretty nice moment for you uh i i have to say well it was a moment for me about democracy why all these people had shown up because they want to be in the fight and um they want to be in the fight because they want to see an america where they can afford to pay for their prescription and drugs they want to see in america where their kids can afford to go to college without getting crushed by student loan debt they want to see in america where we're going to strengthen social security not as donald trump did propos four budgets in a row that cut it so i saw this as a room full of volunteers who are in the fight all the way senator i actually wish i actually wish uh donald trump would would uh would consider doing something to to entitlement so that but i i don't think that's that's really the case the the price gouging here's what theing let's do remember he did try times i wish he would to actually you know it maybe move it out to 70 or 75 cuz something's got to be done cuz it's it's going to be untenable the way it is look at the washington post and if you lose the washington post as a democrat you got some serious problems uh this is what they said about uh about the uh the price gouging or the price control legislation it was really pillared from from both sides of the aisle even uh jason ferman i don't know if you saw some of his comments he said uh it's it's not good policy and it could actually do more harm than good and i i can i can paint you a picture of how that would work and how it's worked in the past where we've tried to artificially hold prices down competition doesn't come in people don't like if beef is too high people don't move the chicken the competitors don't come in to undercut where the beef prices are nothing works when you try to artificially control prices it's just a supply and demand issue it's a flawed idea so so did you have a question here yes why would you propose a flawed idea when when the real problem if you really want to help the middle class if you really sincerely want to help people having trouble at the grocery store it's not price gouging that's the issue and and if you look at it seriously and and really want to help them then let's do something about it together fine i i understand if you want to if you want to do a lecture about this but let's just start with where have you been for the last 30 years uh as three dozen states have price gouging laws and they have used them effectively states like texas and florida um they've used price gouging laws price gouging laws are not price control price gouging laws are to say you know sometimes markets go off the rails and when they do we need some ways to get them back on the rails we need some curbs on that behavior so for example we watched in the pandemic how prices went up for a whole lot of reasons they went up partly because we had supply chain kinks we had uh problems because of the war in ukraine that that cuts supplies of certain commodities and one of the things that happened as a result of that is there were corporations that said w oh now that we have inflation now that prices are up overall this is a great opportunity for us to raise prices not just in passing along cost but to go way way way above that and what how do we know that it was way way above just passing along long cost look at what happened to their profit margins if they just been passing a long cost profit margins would have stayed about the same saying but for some industries some companies profit margins shot up and do you know where they shot up most often it was in companies or in industries where there was a lot of concentration a lot of market power places where the market is not functioning competitively so you end up with someone you remember we all talked about egg prices you end up with something like this giant egg producer uh cal main and calain raises the price of eggs their profit margins increase by 7 18% that's not just passing along long cost and that is a time in your example on on craft your example on craft is wor you finished first interiew around the country that already have price gouging can i tell you why those are fci and misleading at best and the craft your craft analogy is even why can't i tell you please let me tell you craft you say was 440 per profit increase the example you used the prior quarter from the year before they had an a charge of $1.3 billion an accounting change which wiped out profits then they earned what they normally let finish now they they f they earn you didn't let me finish look at the data come on we have economic study now after economic study they show when there is more conentration 40 million eggs were destroyed because of conentration in an industry we have seen much greater increases do you attribute to inflation that's what you think we need to do to sol they're not random they are not random one offs it is part of the problem when you've got companies that are gouging consumer on prices consumers need to know they've got somebody on their side senator listen we trying to help we're trying to in the 36 where are you in the 36 37 states that currently have price la point k here can i going to this is the way you never lose an argument because no one can ever say anything back to you senator state price ging laws take a they look at a when a state of emergency is declared and they for the most part say if your prices go up 10 or 15% compared to before that state of emergency you have to pay a fine so on a national level how exactly would this work would you define the state of emergency does it have to be declared on a national level are you then talking about a 10 or 15% increase in prices versus prior to that declaration and then companies have to pay a fine okay fine maybe that applies in 1% of the situations but this legislation which is still vague is making it sound like something on the scale of broad price controls would be imposed broadly speaking so which of the two systems is it so it is not price controls this is about when the market itself is not functioning sometimes markets don't function because there's been a localized emergency uh a hurricane a wildfire a flooding and so in states that have these price gouging laws they can come in and say look you can do some price increases but if you're going above a certain level you have to be able to justify it you have to show what you're doing is passing a long cost it be by re let let's go back to cow because aven flu caused the destruction of 40 million eggs they have 20% market share they have 20% but they don't control the market it's like op or it's like oil when oil prices go up for whatever reason or they go down when they go down the prices set for oil the reason that c made that money was because that's what happened to the price the next quarter they went down in half they lost 50% of the profits from the last they don't set that price that's the and and neither do the exxon does not set the price of oil so when exxon has $80 or $100 a barrel yes they make record profits when there was a pandemic their profits went to almost zero now it's it's just the way it is and to think that the government can decide when prices are too high or too low the grocery chains have a 2% profit margin how about apple with 50% or 40% how do you decide this is not the government's place to do these things it's a fool's errand and it also is you're using it to divert the real cause of inflation over the last four years which was because you had demand after the pandemic which which uh obviously you know there was a lot cuz we reopened and all of a sudden there's supply chain issues and the demand is juiced by all the stimulus from the ira and all the other spending that we did there have been many causes for inflation we all understand that that's why i started my answer in talking about this but one of the causes of prices going up is that there are companies that have market dominance that have said oh this is a moment when everyone is give me another name name another one give me an instance please can give me an finish my argument here go ahead that they have gone on earnings calls and said over and over inflation has been very very good do go listen to the earnings calls from the ceo of chipot who says this is an opportunity not to pass along costs this is an opportunity for us to raise prices beyond passing along costs and increase our profit margin and what the academic studies i let you finish what the academic studies show is that industry by industry when you see more competition which suggests more pricing power what we saw is that profit margins went up and that's the problem we've got is that states have tools to deal with this locally but right now we want to make sure that the ft c has the tools to do it nationally and that the states that don't have price gouging laws also have access to those same tools we have anti in the same way in the same way that the ftc for example has tools to be able to deal with deceptive pricing uh and deceptive uh advertising it should have the ability to deal with price gouging it's just another tool in the toolbox to say weate of ecy the whole when did companies learn how to do let you finish your argument i know but now did you invite me on here just a lecture to me no i just want to ask you point is to get markets that are more competitive and that's the job of the ftc that's something state attorneys general work on we just want to put one more tool in the toolbox when ceos are going going on the phone saying boy inflation is great because it gives us a chance to raise our it's not about it's not about diverting the attention away from the real issues that might actually help the middle class that you always talk about helping for 40 years companies didn't know how to price gouge until three and a half years ago when president biden was elected where was the price gouging caught we had 40-year highs in inflation where was the price they just learned how to do this 3 and a2 years ago no the difference is prices were not going up and as i said prices started going up for a whole host of reasons prices went up because of the pandemic prices went up because of supply chain kinks prices went up because of the war in ukraine prices were going up and the difference is when they started going up sharply and people noticed that companies some companies also noticed and said you know we could raise our prices just passing along cost that's what you do in a competitive market this is not wi some companies this is not wi finish i let you finish in some markets what we've seen in markets where there's less competition that ceos said we can do more than passal long cost and you don't have to take my word for it do you listen to earnings calls i listen have the example you use for the example you use for craft is totally fous is totally fous and you just want to keep talking the earnings calls ceos have gotten out it's well documented and they have said we can raise our prices far more than passing along cost and said to their investors we have a great because a mon margins are going to in other companies come in that's the way places where there's more concentration that's the whole point it makes your point when market there's more price gouging when markets are more competitive it's not price there is no price gouging would it be a state of emergency only the only last thing senator warranted just to give people a sense if are we talking about what period of time for declaring when we're looking is a state of emergency how do we define the period of time and then by what percentage 10 15% and then are we talking about finding companies is that is it that is it modeled on the state approach here the question you ask is the same question that people want to ask about what is fraud what is uh deceptive advertising the answer is that you look at all of the facts and say do we see a competitive market where a buyer can uh understand what it is that they're being offered and do we have a seller that's meeting that buyer are they competing with other sellers that's what we do in antitrust law all day of terms there's nothing special here it's putting one more tool in the toolbx when there's a lot of concentration in an industry and that starts pushing prices up the the example for cra it just if it was done in a straightforward way senator it it would just be your your argument would would be much better when when you say craft raised profits 440 per. it was because the year before they had taken an accounting charge which brought their their profit down to zero so when they earn a normal profit the next quarter of $800 million your people put out information it's up $ 44% that's disingenuous the as kelly puts out competition come the cure for higher prices is when people come in and undercut those prices and supply goes back up this has been since 177 especially the restaurant business take take yes for an answer when there is competition prices will reach right we need then we need antitrust laws and anti monopoly laws yes we do yes we have we already have we don't need we don't need to lir another one on here that that that works at on what what are the number of cases you're talking about 1% no so listen again to the studies when there is more conc i think i saw the study from groundworks it's a liberal think tank senator from groundworks that one look if you don't want to pay attention to the numbers you can ignore them you can ignore the calls but the reality paying attention to the i let you talk okay the reality is the american people know what's happening in pricing they understand that they are being prices and who they blame for that are these giant corporations they blame the dominate entire no you blame the biden administ because you cannot bear the notion that sometimes these competitive markets are in fact not competitive and when they're not ceos have found ways to juice their profits at the expense of the american public and you may not like that but the american people understand what's happening and they want to have people in government who at least have tools in the toolbox to be able to respond when it happens soic inflation has already come down without any of this happening how does that h why do price why do companies stop gouging why why did cow why did the prices come down 50% immediately why does it happen i'm not i'm not at all clear that prices have come down a lot of companies a lot of companies in very concentrated industries have raised their prices and are sitting the rate of inflation come down and are sitting on much bigger profit margins than they were sitting on the food industry they're less than the profit margins are less than they were before the pandemic senator in the in the food they are not in industries where there's more concentration look i get it you want to pretend that markets will always correct i just wanted i want to try i want to try conquer inflation this do who i am i am somebody who believes in competitive markets that's what i want to see happen that's what i'm out there fighting for but competitive markets won't happen on their own when these companies get bigger and bigger and bigger one of the consequences is that they start figuring out other ways to juice their profits they do things like they cut quality they stop innovating and they start building up their profit margins yeah we have antitrust laws and thank goodness for lena khan who's out there starting to enforce them and to say these giant compan comp cannot just dominate entire markets and do whatever they want because we don't get the benefits then of markets this is just one more tool in the toolbox to deal with companies that use their dominance to be able to boost their profit margins that's all uh tell me we're out of time senator it's been real and it's been fun it's been uh and it's good to go back and forth we've done this before um and we're going to have to agree to disagree i i think that the way that the united states came out of the pandemic you want to thank the government i i think the private sector uh we can thank for the 15 million jobs and everything else so i i i i think we need to embrace it there may be a few bad actors uh but the whole idea that it's all about uh you know these bad corporations is just illc conceived but thanks for your time she hey she'd let you finish she did well to end the interview but she had the last word next un squad pod we will talk to a food ceo about price management kava's brett schulman joins us from the end of 19 to the end of 23 we only raised prices about 12% during that time period cpi went up about 18% the department of labor has noted that uh fast food has raised prices upwards of 30% so it's really enhanced our relative value proposition you're listening toad lock pod from cnbc stand by joe in 3 2 one is mike q i'm joe colel along with kelly evans becky and andrew are off today look at sh sher zak cava by the way if you want to see uh where some of the excitement is the mediterranean chain they're soaring after they raised their full year outlook second quarter results beat analyst estimates we're talking about about a 10% pop in the stock comp sales are up 14.4% and they expect full year comps now to rise by as much as 9 and 1 half% up from the previous forecast of just 6 and a half the restaurant chain said customers flocked to its new grilled steak offering during the quarter despite the higher price tag and they raised prices in january less than 3% say they have no plans for another increase this year ceo brett schulman will join us i am very i'm back in aaba moment we were early adopters and i didn't go for a while and i i just had the stak two days ago you have i've only been once but i i i see why people like it it's good it's it is really good it's like uh it's not you know i love mexican food so i it it's like almost looks like it it's like wrapped in some thing and it's spicy and uh you know a lot of flavor so people who compare it to chipotle i'm like i still feel like chipotle has broader appeal like the not to me you know that's said no taco bell if i if i'm going to get that's why they stole the guy from t who's now at starbucks but to his credit he did not you know worsen the quality of the chipotle food while he was there he did not go that route that some of the purists might have worried about he und how to you make keep the culture what it was and there are taco bell people and there's chipotle people this is not like a dunkin chipotle has much higher brow people taco bell it's like well i'm just saying i don't know if cava can go as mainstream as chipotle probably not i don't know but we'll talk to him about it joining us now in a first on scbc i interview is cava co-founder and ceo brett schuman we're getting all the uh the background fascinating it is cuz uh i can't believe it's been five quarters already that you've been able to report since c and i can't believe the the stock performance although as i said i i've eaten there and i i do believe this stock performance i really i really liked it uh i've only been there once but the fifth quarter you said you would characterize it as maybe the best quarter you've had yeah the 9 and a half% traffic growth is is just a great performance and a testament to the appeal of our mediterranean cuisine and i want to give a shout out to our 10,000 team members across the country who deliver on our miss to bring heart health and humanity every day and i think our results are a reflection of that you were one of the co-founders in the original cava we just found out it's still around it's it's got it's cava mes did you say in rockville maryland and and they pioneered that's where you got the idea i think yeah so all my co-founders are sons of greek immigrants and the brands origins go back to 2006 when they opened a single full service restaurant still there today in rockville maryland and then started selling the dips and spreads think our crazy feta or hares in a couple local whole foods i was introduced to my co-founders from a friend uh from college who cousin is one of my co-founders and uh they asked me to join up be their fourth partner and uh we took elements of both of those businesses the full service restaurant and our grocery products and uh put it in a fast health-based format to really unleash the power of this food to the world can we talk um just about how you pricing things if you you know we got price gouging leg legislation around have you raised prices more than your costs have increased i think that's been one of the things that uh has really helped us drive our success and and drive our traffic if you think about from the end of 19 to the end of 23 we only raised prices about 12% during that time period cpi went up about 18% the department of labor has noted that uh fast food has raised prices upwards of 30% so it's really enhanced our relative value proposition and able to deliver uh a really compelling value to our guests which obviously you know it's clearly resonating and uh even even recently in uh california with the legislation ab1 1228 i think we were the only limited service brand that did not take incremental price as a result of some of the legislated wage increases are you taking losses though or taking margin hits because you know you're growing so fast you can deal with it down the road you can maybe even take some share from other players because profitability is not the main focus right now well that's the power of our economic model you know our 2-year same restaurant sales growth is over 30% this quarter and that's allowed us to not only invest in our team members so we've invested in wages 9% year-over-year mitigate cost increases to our guests and expand restaurant level margin at the same time i can't so i don't know that that was the question i had i don't know how you can raise prices less than than what your costs were increasing well i think it's how we've built this business from the very beginning we have vertically integrated production capability so so we have two manufacturing facilities where we make our fresh dips and spreads that tziki with fresh cucumber fresh dill just like chef dimitri made in that original caba restaurant but we're making it in 9,000lb batches and that allows us to take the complexity out of the four walls of our restaurants and bring you that fresh product at scale consistently with quality and cost effectiveness we source over 85% of our ingredients directly from our grower rancher partners and uh we've invested in wages like i said you know even back in 2016 we took our national starting wage to $13 an hour when many were paying 9 and1 and $11 an hour and um you know that equals a great service great experience and um that's translated into great growth which obviously we get leveraged on our fixed occupancy costs and other fixed costs how much have you looked to something like a chipotle um to as a template for what you can achieve i mean it's not as if you came from having launched already a successful fast casual chain yourself this is it's hard to get it right the first time so what is the blueprint what is the game plan and many many people there's all these memes going around after the quarter where people are saying your basically your market cap is $37 million per cava location right now even chipotle is only 21 in other words the market is assigning a huge premium to what you're doing but what does the growth blueprint look like yeah i think it's a testament to the belief in our uh massive white space opportunity and the fact that we believe we're creating and defining what we think is going to be the next large- scale cultural cuisine category mediterranean that unique cuisine being where uh you don't have to sacrifice flavor for uh for your health and so our uh growth plan is 1,000 restaurants by 2032 so that's about a 15% plus uh compound annual unit growth rate three times as many as you have now but still only a third of what chipotle has roughly yeah so we're still pretty small in that regard but and i i say restaurants do not scale like sas software it takes a lot of great people a lot of process a lot of infrastructure that we've invested in heavily over the years to be able to uh scale like we're we're growing today what does it mean uh for where you end up you end up where are you not right now and and what are the the plans how many do you add per year and that must be hard to do yeah it's uh you know that's that's the other great thing about this whites space opportunity we operate in 25 states in the district in the district of columbia today we just opened our first locations in the upper midwest in chicago so we have uh those are our only locations in in the upper midwest we're not in the pacific northwest or northern california plus we think we have tremendous depth and breadth of expansion in the 25 states we operate in today you're not going to 50 uh someday we we we aspire to be in all 50 states across how many you averaging new ones per year yeah so this year we raised our guidance from uh to 54 to 57 new locations this year and then uh we've kind of committed to 15% plus uh growth rate from here on out and inflation at this point is not like it was yeah we've seen it pretty benign on our input costs uh and really has uh receded from the supply chain shocks we saw coming out of the pandemic it's weird the way that works cuz other people come in and and where there's an opportunity the supply increases naturally so i think i learned that in 1776 uh actually but we're we're learning again every day brett thank you thanks for having me that's squawk pod for today and for the week happy friday squawkbox is hosted by joe kernin becky quick and andrew ross sorin thanks to

<div><strong>Title:</strong> The bull case for Roku: Guggenheim upgrades stock to 'buy'<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> take a look at roku. today shares down over 20% on  the year the stock took a hit in february as you might remember after  walmart acquired roku's  competitor vizio, but shares popping today up 13% after guggenheim ups to buy, bullish on broadening of ad sales. joining us is guggenheim's michael morris i was surprised because you guys have been i would argue somewhat critical about leadership being  somewhat sluggish, yes >> yeah, that's true i appreciate that you have been  close to our call on the name, and this call today and our  change in rating is really about some of the evolution in leadership, the strategy and executing on that. i'm happy to talk more detail  about that >> well, what do you think they  should and will do and what is this backdrop of, say, third party advertising that's helping out? >> absolutely. so if we take a step back, we  know that the secular trend in streaming media and connected  television is very strong. streaming video right now is about 41% plus of television viewing and that share has been  growing pretty steadily quarter  after quarter and roku is in a great spot roku has 42 million global households connected to their  service, about half of broadband households have at least one roku device in the house so  they've been in a great place, but their monetization has been  slower even though they've been growing their audience they've ground  monetization more slowly and we're been concerned about the drive to grow monetization now i think we are really at the start of seeing the fruits of  their labor, specifically  broadening their ability to  monetize their video advertising inventory. that's number one. right now that monetization is very limited to just being on  their own platform and they've opened it up to partners like  the trade desk the second thing is really pushing hard to monetize that  home screen where they have  those 60 million u.s.  households, 84-plus million  global households starting their streaming experience with that roku device with the roku home screen i think it presents a lot of opportunity for them >> i know it is a tad off topic, but it was a week in which we  got the all-time high netflix, i think at 7/11. is it a comment on what is happening in the broad sphere  and the power of harnessing  advertising when you finally get around to it >> it is i think it is a great point. in the case of netflix, i think  that advertising opportunity for that business is a big part of their future as well for them, it is an outstanding subscription streaming business  that is now giving their consumers their audience more  choice with respect to how they  want to compensate in exchange for the content. i think that has a long runway ahead for them, and i think that that same concept applies to television and streaming television more broadly. we have been in a cycle as most  of the market knows, i'm sure  you are very aware, of declining ratings in linear television,  people choosing different ways to consume especially  entertainment content, right not live things like sports and  news, of course, but in  entertainment content certainly  is better enjoyed on your own  schedule advertisers have been somewhat slow to shift their dollars, and i think we are really seeing an  inflection point as ma<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Crucial test looms for Nvidia ahead of earnings<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> fed chair powell's speech in jackson hole took place, but a crucial test for one of the most market moving stocks ahead will  be nvidia reporting next week. our dehas more hey, de. >> good morning. carl earnings come at a critical time for the cycle at large they say hits the narrative hard again or earnings could justify  the rebound we have seen in  recent weeks the early mega cap reports from  a few weeks ago poured cold  water on a.i. enthusiasm concerns, over billions and  billions of dollars in capex,  little revenue to show so far. valuations have come down to earth. here is where forward p/e ratios stood after the august 1st sell  of -off where they stood and yes  they are on no new news or any further  promise of a.i. monetization, as barclay's puts it nvidia may hold the fate of the big tech  verse rotation trade another note calls it the most important tech earnings in years. there are jitters in nvidia  shares, down yesterday and making up for it today one mega cap name nvidia may not be able to help is alphabet. the multiple is the lowest of  the mag seven and the only one below 20 times earnings. it is the illegal monopoly ruling, the threat of a breakup, another antitrust trial that kicks off in september that's all weighing on this name but i would point out that google is shipping a.i. products now quicker than some of the other big players like apple and openai like its a.i.-powered pixel phones we talked about a few weeks ago. it also brought back an a.i. pioneer who left google to begin character a.i. we now know what he will be  doing back at google according to a report he will be the co-technical lead on gemini, which is at the center of  google's a.i. ambition nvidia for now may be the most important tech event in weeks  but there's other catalysts to come soon. we have apple's big september  event and that will be key and could shift the focus to the a.i. application trade you know, it has been all  about -- mostly about hardware to this point, but i think once <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Former Fed Governor Randy Kroszner: The Fed will not start cutting rates by 50 basis points<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> absolutely. thank you very much, steve  liesman. stay with us for more on what we heard from chair powell. let's bring in former fed  governor randy kroszner. it's good to have you, randy. were you surprised at sort of  how straightforward and  forthcoming the fed chair was  about the time to shift into  policy cuts and the confidence  on inflation coming down? >> no, i wasn't. he likes to give straightforward discussions, and his jackson  hole speeches have tended to be  much shorter rather than much  longer. in the past he made it clear, he made inflation the number one  priority. now it's clear we're worrying  about the downside risk to the  economy is his number one  priority. he didn't quite say the clear  uninflation, but came close to  saying that. that's why he's comfortable and  starting to focus on the  employment situation, and i'm  very much on board with what  steve just said. i don't think they'll start with 50. if they started with 50, that's  an admission that something went wrong, something's problematic. if the employment report in  september is wildly disastrous,  sure, but i don't think so. not that they'll start gradually and pick up pace if the labor  market weakens. >> what do you think the bar is  for the labor market to weaken  for them to do a double in  september or november? >> it's interesting. in his speech he made it very  clear that unemployment rate is  going up, for good reasons  because there are a lot more  coming back into the labor  force. that's the primary reason the  unemployment rate is going up,  they'll be slow on that. if the employment rate starts  moving up rapidly because a lot  of people are losing jobs, he  made direct reference to that,  if there are layoffs, they'll  move more rapidly. i think he gave you the  information of what they're  going to focus on. it's not the labor market in  general, it's how the labor  market specifically might be  weakening.  >> i don't know about you, i'm  fielding some conflicting  commentary about whether the  line about unmistakable labor  cooling reflects some  incremental worry about labor  than we heard at the july  presser. do you have a sense of that? >> i think there's a little bit  more concern around that. obviously, with all the tumult  in the markets and such because  it's not just about the data,  it's also about the perception  of the data. and so i think there's a little  bit more concern. i think what's going to happen  is the labor market will weaken  substantially. interest rates, when you adjust  for inflation, have been quite  high, the real interest rates  have been quite high over the  last year or so. with the traditional and  variable lags that will hit  later this year and next year. so i think the labor market will weaken a bit faster than many of the analysts think. and so they're going to have to  move a little more rapidly. i don't think they're going to  say right in the beginning, up,  we were too slow, we have to  move quickly. >> can i get you to forecast  when we get our first, say,  double digit print or even  negative print? >> oh, that's -- i'll hide  behind the phrase of the long  and variable lags that chicago  economists have been saying for  a long time. we will start to see with  greater force towards the end of this year, last quarter of this  year, you'll sta<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> How lower mortgage rates will impact the housing market<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> market. new data shows july home sales  coming in better than expected,  up 10% month on month. first monthly gain since  february. what does that mean for demand  as mortgage rates continue to  tick lower? joining us, one of the biggest  players in home building, taylor morrison ceo, sheryl palmer. we're glad to have you on a day  like today. i'm curious where you were when  you heard powell's comments? >> well, i am so glad to be here this morning. thank you for having me, carl. yes, it's -- i raced here  because we just had the  opportunity to move that bus. you might recall that show where we move the bus. we just moved that bus for the  fourth family we've done in the  last many weeks for "extreme  makeover." i'm here in houston. i was listening as the family  was stepping out of the bus and  racing over here. we should expect some rate cut. >> can you talk to viewers --  you're right, it's not a  complete surprise, although it  is a ratification of what the  market's been trying to price  in. how have you been adjusting the  business tactically for a moment like this? >> you know, we've been prepared for this. as i talked on our earnings call a few weeks ago, the momentum  we've seen in the market has  been very consistent. our ability to have homes at  every stage of construction for  the families that have an  immediate need to the families  that want to build their dream  home and pick the lot and the  plan. honestly, with our  diversification of consumers, as well as our inventory of lots  and, you know, homes under  construction to completed homes, we're very well positioned. for exactly this time. >> what are you seeing in terms  of pick up in activity? we've clearly seen existing and  new home sales tick up lately,  in moves we haven't seen in a  while. clearly, the lower mortgage  rates are having an impact,  sheryl. are you seeing that? >> yeah, we are, sara. and i say it always takes a  couple of weeks for the news to  make it out to the marketplace. we've seen about a  50-basis-point reduction in the  last 30 days. and we immediately saw a pick up in our traffic, as we talked  about our earnings call. there's a huge demand out there. at the other end, we are still  seeing affordability challenges  but the reduction in interest  rates, and i think the likely  action from the fed here in the  next few weeks will only  continue to help. so, once again, i think we're  well positioned. there's nice choice out there  for the consumer today. and as we talked before, sar  remarks the new home market, our ability to help the consumer in  the way they need help, if it's  helping them with <br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> so let me wrap up by emphasizing that the pandemic economy has proved to be unlike any other and that there remains much to be learned from this extraordinary period our statement on longer run goals and monetary policy strategy emphasizes our commitment to reviewing our principles and making appropriate adjustments through a thorough public review every 5 years as we begin this process later this year we will be open to criticism and new ideas while preserving the strengths of our framework the limits of our knowledge so clearly evident during the pandemic demand humility and a questioning spirit focused on learning lessons from the past and applying them flexibly to our current challenges<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Compass CEO Robert Reffkin: It's still a seller's market<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> 2000 etf. >> thanks. >>> by the way, one of those  stocks doing well is yompas up  5%. ceo and co-founder joins us here at post 9. music to your ears, right, hear  jay powell spell it out about  the time to cut rates.  >> today is a good day for  compass, for real estate. for him to say the time has come for policy to change is music to our ears. it's been three years of a  rising rate environment and  we're looking forward to a  declining one.  >> we've already seen mortgage  rates and treasury yields fall  in anticipation of this move. how much activity has that  brought on? >> we see more inventory, 20%  more inventory than this time  last year. we saw existing home sales  yesterday up for the first time  after four consecutive months of decline. but we're not yet seeing buyers  rush back. what we're hearing from our  agents, and we have a unique  perspective, nearly 30,000  agents were focused on sole  volume, but we're hearing buyers are waiting for the september  18th cut. they see in the headlines, rates are going down on september  18th. i think there's a  misunderstanding much how much  of that rate cut is already  baked into today's mortgage  rates. it's actually a good time to buy in advance of september 18th  because you'll have effectively  a similar mortgage rate with  less competition. >> right. so, they think the fed is  actually going to lower their  mortgage rate in september,  which is -- it's the market  rates.  >> can i ask you about the  rental market for a second in  new york city. new york city, which was counted out three or four years ago. i got this recently from a large owner of apartment rentalals,  giving me an update on what  they're seeing. throughout their portfolio, huge surge of tenants moving into new york. currently 63.5 of new tenants  are tenants moving to the city  for the first time. highest they've seen on record  since they started keeping track in 2010. new inventory, percentage of  total inventory, zero. zero percent. a crisis, they're talking about, in renting space in manhattan. property fundamentals booming. then they go on to say as well,  tenants have high earning  potential and are paying high  rents. what's happening here in new  york? >> i think we're seeing a return to theme that lasted decades  before covid, which is people  moving from the suburbs into the cities. and new york is one of the  biggest beneficiaries of that. >> so it's real? >> it's very real. >> and are people going to start buying apartments as a result of being unable to rent them? >> well, rental inflation we're  finally seeing from a country  perspective, we're seeing it  flatten out. the prices have not increased  over the last number of months,  which is a good sign for  inflation. >> you mentioned inventory. and it seems like the real  growth in inventory is in the  supply of new homes, right? single family new? >> it's new and existing. but we just saw today that new  home sales saw nearly the  highest increase in new home  sales since early 2022. >> so what happens to pricing  even in demand holds up, given  that surge in inventory in.  >> i think prices will continue  to remain high. we have four months supply right now. six months means a balanced  market between buyers and  sellers so it's still a sellers  market.  >> are you worried about  florida, texas, which we talked  about a couple of times? >> what's happening in florida  is very unique. florida has a new rule for old  inventory, which will require  the owners of the condo to put  in a lot of money to fix it up. so, there's been effectively a  rush of inventory of old  inventory. i think you even see today in  the new home sales, new home  sales have bounced back faster  than existing home sales. people have money, they want to  buy new things. the markets with high income  markets have performed better  than low income markets. it's florida with this old  inventory -- it's a unique  problem.  >> how much pent-up demand is  there? we hear about the lock-in  effect, people not moving  because they have the low  mortgage rates but they want to. a, how much will stimulate that? >> give me something with a 5,  5.999, and i think we'll see  seasonally adjusted home rate  back at 5 million or above. the home sales have between 4  million to 2.7 million over the  last 30 years. last year was 4 million, the  lowest since 1995, 28 years ago. we're <br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> >> it affects a lot of people  paying rent. thank you, eamon. eamon javers from washington.  >>> back to jackson hole and  what we heard from the fed chair with major averages rallying  higher. bianco research president jim  bianco joins us. i think of you as bond guy, jim. we did see bonds rally. treasuries rally on the back of  this speech. the dollar also lost some of its gains. and weakened pretty  substantially. you were surprised at all with  what we heard and the market  reaction? >> no, i wasn't surprised  because the speech was more of a confirmation of what the market  had been expecting. and the rallies that we're  seeing just undid yesterday. there was a fear in the market,  both the bond and the stock  market, that powell might come  out a little more hawkish than  everybody thought. he didn't. we undid yesterday. now we're going to try to parse  through the speech. i think the big takeaway on the  speech is, obviously, they're  going to cut rates in september. we know that. but we don't really know how far they're going to go after that. how much do they plan on going  100 basis points or three or  four rate cuts and be done with  it? he did imply that the labor  market is now going to take  center stage. the payroll report is going to  probably surpass the inflation  report as being the most  important statistic of the  month.  >> so, what is the bond rally  telling you, the fact they're  increasing odds of a  50-basis-point cut this  september, the fact there's  still 100 basis points of cuts  priced in by the end of the  year. does that look right to you or a little much overdoing it? >> well, i'm in the no landing  camp, meaning that i don't think the economy is having a soft  landing. i think it's doing better than  that. and i fear that all of these  cuts we have priced into the  market might be overdoing it and set the stage for sticky  inflation throughout 2025. so, i'm on the opposite side of  chairman powell. i don't have confidence we're on our way to 2%. we've seen this before. we saw this in january. incidentally, coming off another powell speech where he kind of  said, we're on the way to 2%,  and then inflation shot back up  in january. and then that put the cuts for  all year on hold until  september. so, i think that the economy is  going to continue to stay  stronger. the bond market kind of reacts  to what the fed is doing and a  little bit of hope in that  they're going to get rate cuts  because the market wants rate  cuts and it wants to see that  the rate cuts are going to go  there.  >> what are you seeing in the  inflation reads that the fed is  not seeing, that keeps you  worried about it? >> it bottomed a year and a half ago at 3% cpi. it hasn't made any progress. it's 2.9. it's taken almost a year and a  half to go down 0.10.  >> but pce has gone down to  2.5%. that's moved more. that's what they care about.  >> core inflation has gone down. the same thing with that, right, the fed's target on core pce is  2%. it's not 2.5%. and there's evidence that might  be bottoming. near these levels, i think we're at the cyclical lows in  inflation, again, because i  think the economy is going to do well. one last thing is inflation is  probably the hardest economic  indicator to predict, but  everybody on wall street thinks  it's the easiest economic  indicator to predict. go back to transitory three  years ago and jay powell got a  nervous laugh in the crowd when  he acknowledged they got that  completely wrong three years  ago. it's a difficult thing to  predict. they're basing everything on  this idea that the labor market  is weakening, but the data in  the labor market is very mixed,  whether you're talking about the psalm rule or recent revisions  down. there's an argument we've had a  big population in the country  via migration bringing different demographics into the labor  market which looks at the  unemployment rate going up not  clean. that's why claudia has said  herself maybe her recession  number is not correct because of the increase of excess supply. i wish he would have addressed  that. heseems to be taking the data  at fac<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Fed Chair Powell: The labor market has cooled considerably<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> today the labor market has cooled considerably from its formerly overheated state the unemployment rate began to rise over a year ago and is now at 4.3% still low by historical standards but almost a full percentage point above its level in early 2023 most of that increase has come over the past 6 months so far rising unemployment has not been the result of elevated layoffs as is typically the case in an economic downturn rather the increase mainly reflects a substantial increase in the supply of workers and a slowdown from the previously frantic pace of hiring even so the cooling in labor market conditions is unmistakable job gains remain solid but have slowed this year<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> DOJ sues real estate firm RealPage, claiming software enabled collusion on rents<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> >> mike, we'll talk in a bit. obviously a key day and key  week. mike santoli. >>> we're getting a news alert  from the doj on antitrust. for that we'll turn to eamon  jaifers.  >> take a live look at the  department of justice here in  washington, d.c., where attorney general merrick garland is  making some remarks. they are announcing a new civil  antitrust case, just filed  within the past couple of  moments. it's significant, carl, you  before the break were talking  about housing rental price  inflation. in this case, the department of  justice and eight states are  suing a software provider to  real estate firms, to landlords, called real page. they're alleging real page used  its algorithms to collude among  landlorded to raise prices  lockstep. they were using the algorithms  to do what old-fashioned  colluders used to do in a  smoke-filled room. this is the first time they are  interrogating the code of an  algorithm. they are alleging the software  is driving up prices on rental  units. here's the key element from the  department of justice's case. they say, to realpage the  greater good is served by  ensuring otherwise competing  landlords rob americans of the  fruits of competition. lower rental prices, better  leasing terms, more concessions. at the same time, the landlords  enjoy the benefits of  coordinated pricing among  competitors. the doj goes on to say, realpage replaces competition with  coordination, it substitutes  unity for rivalry, subverts  competition and the competitive  process. it does so openly and directly. and american renters are left  paying the price. so, this is a privately held  company out of texas, guys. they are a big player here, but  this is an interesting case to  watch because it may have  bearing on other places in the  economy where this kind of  algorithmic collusion from the<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Fed Chair Powell is 'a bit more definitive' on rate cuts than I'd imagined, says Roger Ferguson<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> points. the dollar is weakening  significantly off the back of  that speech. for more reaction to jay powell  let's bring in live from jackson hole former federal reserve vice chair and past tiaa ceo roger  ferguson a cnbc contributor. it's great to have you here. you were in the room. what's your reaction to what we  heard from the fed chair? the time has come to adjust  snols.  >> my reaction, i think similar  what i've heard from others he  was definitive not hejds. a bit more definitive than i  imagined frankly. at the same token he was not in  any sense declaring to be  completely -- he -- it wasn't a  victory lap. i like the speech, and it  reinforced messages that  september is very much the time  to look for the next move.  >> and what is that next move  going to look like? 25, 50? >> i think at this stage the  odds are much more towards 25. the market might be leaning  towards 50. but this situation is not  getting out of hand. he observed while unemployment  has gone up, it is still at  normal levels. so while he doesn't want to see  it worsen, i don't think he  feels the necessary -- necessity to move dramatically. so i would suggest and expect a  series of 25s as the most likely outcome at this stage.  >> he said that his confidence  has grown that inflation is on a sustainable path to 2%. talked about inflation  expectations. i know it's the prevailing view  that inflation is back on a  sustainable path to 2%, but is  there a risk in that view.  >> we still have pockets of the  economy with higher than target  inflation sticking around longer than expected.  >> so i do think there are risks from that view. let's be clear. core inflation and what's called super core are both well above  anything that feels like 2%. and so another reason for them  to be cautious is they don't  want to lose control of the  narrative. he identified inflation  expectations as being an  important part of this. if it looks as though, you know, they are taking their eye off  the inflation ball altogether  then there are risks there. ing so that's to me yet another  reason to move cautiously even  though he didn't use those words but i would suggest that's the  more likely outcome at this  stage for a variety of reasons.  >> where would you be looking,  roger, for a marginally rate to  start to impact the economy  first? would you see it show up in  discretionary consumer? would you expect to see the  housing pent up demand get  unlocked? where should we keep our eyes  focused? >> i think it's going to be in  housing. the usual discussion around  inflation expectations. obviously, because the labor  market is still relatively  strong, consumers are still  doing reasonably well when it  comes to wages, so i don't  expect that to be the place  where the turn is foreseen. i think it's going to be much  more in the so-called inflation  sensitive sectors. housing has been a problem for  quite a while. to be clear, if you give me  another minute or two, the  housing story is much more than  simply an interest rate story. it is also a story about the  ability to start new homes which has been very slow for a period  of time. so i think all of this is going  to take some time to play  through. and i don't think, actually, as  they reduce rates that we're  going to see the economy zoom or take off. they're trying to keep it stable roughly where it is now, drawing a little bit close to potential  unemployment not getting worse,  nice balance between job market, supply and demand, so i think  they like wher<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> the time has come for policy to adjust the direction of travel is clear and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks we will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability with an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2% inflation while maintaining a strong labor market the current level of our policy rate gives us ample room to respond to any risks we may face including the risk of unwelcome further weakening in labor market conditions<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Fed Chair Powell gave a 'marvelous' speech at Jackson Hole, says Georgetown's McCulley<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> inflation is on a sustainable  path back to 2%.  >> that sounded pretty  confident. now the bigger risk is  employment, employment. what's your take? frrjts i thought it was an  absolutely marvelous speech. i would call it a valle dixer to yan. we don't see those very often. you see them at turning points. essentially this this was a  valedictorian of essentially  chair powell turning the page,  saying the mission, which has  been focused on inflation for  the last two years, has been  successful and that we are there and that i you going forward the mission is going to be  maximizing full employment. he doesn't want to see any  further weakness in the labor  market. and that we're beginning an  easing journey back towards  neutral. i thought it was an absolutely  marvelous graduation speech in h from a successful anti-inflation campaign now to a new campaign  to maximize employment and  represent further deterioration. it was a marvelous.  >> david asked if there was  anything surprising. we expected the pivot to come. i guess there was a risk he  wouldn't necessarily be as steve said so unhedged when it came to confidence on inflation and the  timing to adjust. it's been priced in. the market has already moved so  much when it comes to pricing in rate cuts for this year and  next. you do wonder how much longer a  speech like this and policy  pivot can carry us.  >> exactly. it would be really hard for  powell to have kind of outdoved  the market based on how the  market had gotten priced in  there. the bond market, yields,  breaking down. we saw what's going on with the  dollar. i think that was mostly  happening a couple days ago. people got really over their  skis. now we have it priced and it's  about monitoring it. the soft landing is not  everyone's comfortable with  everything. it's, sometimes it looks like  we're sliding into a downturn  and sometimes looks like things  are great and we're  reaccelerating and nets out to  being kind of slow and steady. you guys were talking about the  two years ago when he said we  might have pain. unemployment was at 3.6% then. up to 4.3. he characterized that as  unemployment didn't have to go  above the norm or what we used  to think of as full unemployment to get inflation down. nominal gdp point to point from  that speech two years ago up  5.5%. obviously, you know, it was  definitely an upside surprise to how the economy was able to  handle it and now it's about,  you know, monitoring along the  way. that's all we're going to be  doing week to week. . >> is there a powell put again,  paul? he's -- he's in adjustment mode  and has the market in the  economy's back. doesn't want to see weakness.  >> i think there's a put from  the standpoint that in the pace  of the easing to come. my base case scenario is that we are on a journey of 25 basis  point cuts for the next eight  meetings. comhundred cumulative. that's my base case. if we see weaker growth and  particularly weaker jobs, then i think we could have a bit of  front loading and start the  process with 50 basis point  cuts. i don't think that's the base  case yet, but clearly he's  opened the door for front  loading of the easing process  just like you had front loading  of the tightening process. if we see material further  deterioration in the labor  market. i think that was -- if there was a positive surprise in his  speech today, which was  marvelous, it was the notion he  drew a line in that we don't  want to see further deceleration in the labor market. we're there so i think that  would be the trigger if we were  moved to 50 basis point  increments versus 25. i think essentially the takeaway from this is over the next year, you're going to get a couple  hundred basis points worth of  easing which is simply  validating<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Fed Chair Powell: Less upside risks to inflation, more downside risks to employment<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> severe labor shortage and  inflation peaked at 7.1% in june 2022. at this podium two years ago i  discussed the possibility  addressing inflationing could  bring some pain in the form of  higher employment and slowed  growth. i expressed our unconditional  commitment to fully restoring  price stability and to keeping  ahead until the job is done. the fomc did not flinch from  carrying out our  responsibilities, and our  actions forcefully demonstrated  our commitment to restoring  price stability. we raised our policy rate by 425 basis points in 2022, and  another 100 basis points in 2023 and we've held our policy rate  at its current restricted level  since july 2023. the summer of 2022 proved to be  the peak of inflation, the  percentage point from the peak  has occurred in the context of  low employment a welcomed and  unusual result. how did inflation fall without a sharp rise in unemployment above its estimated natural rate. pandemic related distortions to  supply and demand and severe  shocks to energy and commodity  markets were drivers of high  inflation. and the reversal has been a key  part of the story of its  decline. the unwinding of these factors  took much longer than expected,  but ultimately played a large  role in the subsequent  disinflation. our restrictive monetary policy  contributed to a moderation in  aggregate demand combined with  improvements to reduce  inflationary pressures allowing  growth to continue at a healthy  pace. as labor demand moderated, a  historically high level of  vacancies relative to  unemployment has normalized  through a decline in vacancies  without sizable and disruptive  layoffs bringing the labor  market to state where it is no  longer a source of inflationary  pressures. a word on the kriftscle  importance of inflation  expectations. standard economic models have  long reflected the view that  inflation will return to its  objective when product and labor markets are balanced without the need for economic slack, so long as inflation expectations are  anchored at our objective. that's what the model said. but the stability of longer run  inflation expectations since the 2000s had not been tested by a  persistent burst of high  inflation. it was far from assured that the inflation anchor would hold. concerns over the anchoring  contributed to the view that  disinflation would require slack in the economy, and specifically in the labor market. an important takeaway from  recent experience is that  anchored inflation expectations, reinforced by vigorous central  bank actions can facilitate  disinflation without the need  for slack. this narrative attributes much  of the increase in inflation to  an extraordinary collision  between overheated and  temporarily distorted demand in  constraint and supply. while researchers differ in  their approaches and some extent in their conclusions a consensus seems to be emerging which i see as attributing most of the rise  in inflation to this glitch. all told, the healing from  pandemic distortions, our  efforts to moderate aggregate  demand and the anchoring of  expectation have worked together to put inflation on what  increasingly appears to be a  sustainable path to our 2%  objective. disinflation while preserving  labor market strength is only  possibility with expectations  which reflect the public's  confidence that central bank  will bring about 2% inflation  over time. that confidence has been built  over decades and reinforced by  our actions. that is my assessment of events. your mileage may differ. let me wrap up by emphasizing  the economy has proven to be  unlike any other and that there  remains much to be learned from  this extraordinary period. our statement on longer run  goals and monetary policy  strategy, making appropriate  adjustments through a thorough  public review every five years. as we begin this process later  this year, we will be open to  criticism and new ideas, while  preserving the strengths of our  framework. the limits of our knowledge so  clearly evident during the  pandemic, demand humility and a  questioning spirit, focu<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Fed Chair Powell: We will do everything we can to support a strong labor market<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> the risks of unwelcomed further  weakening in labor market  conditions. so let's now turn to the  questions of why inflation rose  and why it has fallen so  significantly even as  unemployment has remained low. there's a growing body of  research on these questions,  including the work which we'll  shortly discuss, and that is a  good time for this discussion. it is, of course, too soon to  make definitive assessments. this period will be analyzed and debated long after we are all  gone. the arrival of the covid-19  pandemic led quickly to  shutdowns in economies around  the world. it was a time of radical  uncertainty and severe downside  risks. as so often happens in times of  crisis, americans adapted and  innovated, governments responded with extraordinary force,  especially in the united states. congress unanimously passed the  cares act, the fed we used our  powers to an unprecedented  extent to stabilize the  financial system and stave off  an economic depression. after a historically deep, but  brief recession, in mid-2020,  the economy began to grow again. and as the risks of a severe  extended downturn receded and as the economy reopened, we faced  the risk of replaying the  painfully slow recovery that  followed the global financial  crisis. congress delivered additional  fiscal support in late 2020 and  again in early 2021. spending recovered strongly in  the first half of 2021 and the  ongoing pandemic shaped the  pattern of the recovery,  lingering concerns over covid  weighed on spending on in-person services, but pent up demand  stimulative policies, pandemic  changes in work and leisure  practices, and the additional  savings associated with  constrained services spending,  all contributed to a historic  surge in consumer spending on  goods. the pandemic wreaked havoc on  supply conditions. 8 million people left the  workforce at its onset and the  size of the labor force was 4  million below its prepandemic  level in 2021. the labor force would not return to its prepandemic trend until  mid-2023. supply chains were snarld by  lost workers, disrupted trade  linkages and tectonic shifts in  the composition and level of  demand. clearly, this was nothing like  the slow recovery after the  global financial crisis. enter inflation. k after running below target  through 2020, inflation spiked  in march and april 2021. the initial burst of inflation  was concentrated rather than  broad-based with extremely large price increases for goods in  short supply, such as motor  vehicles. my colleagues and i judged at  the outset that these  pandemic-related factors would  not be persistent and thus the  sudden rise in inflation was  likely to pass through fairly  quickly without the need for a  monetary policy response. in short that inflation would be transitory. standard thinking has long been  that, as long as inflation  expectations remain well  anchored, it can be appropriate  for central banks to look  throughing a temporary rise in  inflation. the good shift transitory was a  crowded one. with most mainstream analysts  and advanced economy central  bankers on board, i think i see  some former ship mates out there today. the common expectation was that  supply conditions would improve  reasonably quickly, that the  rapid recovery in demand run its course and that demand would  rotate back from goods to  services bringing inflation  down. for a time the data were  consistent with the transitory  hypothesis. monthly readings for core  inflation declined every month  from april through september  2021, although progress came  slower than expected. the case began to weaken around  mid-year as was reflected in our communications, and beginning in october the data turned hard  against the transitory  hypothesis. inflation rose and broadened out from goods to services, and it  became clear that high flation  was not transitory and that it  would require a strong response  if inflation expectations were  to remain well anchored. we recognize that and pivoted  beginning in november. financial conditions began to  tighten, and after phasing out  asset purchases we lifted off in march of 2022. by early 2022, headline exceeded 6%. new supply shocks appeared. russia's invasion of ukraine led to a sharp increase in energy  and commodity prices. the improvements in supply  conditions in the rotation and  demand from goods to services  were taking much longer than  expected due to further covid  waves in the united states and  covid continued to disrupt  production globally, including  through new and extended  lockdowns in china. high rates in inflation were a  global phenomenon reflected in  common experience, rapid  increases in the demand for  goods, strained supply chains,  tight labor markets, and sharp  hikes in commodity prices. the global any tour of inflation was unlike any period since the  1970s. back then, high inflation became entrenched and outcome we were  us utterly committed to avoid. by 2022 the labor market was  tight with employment increasing by 6.5 million jobs from the  middle of 2021. this increase in labor demand  was met in part by workers  rejoining the labor force as  health concerns began to fade,  but labor supply remained  constrained. in the summer of 2022, labor  force participation remained  well below prepandemic levels. there were nearly twice as many  job openings as unemployed  persons from march of 22 to the  end of the y<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Fed Chair Powell: Inflation is now much closer to our objective<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> our restrictive monetary policy helped restore balance between aggregate supply and demand easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remained well anchored inflation is now much closer to our objective with prices having risen 2.5% over the past 12 months after a pause earlier this year progress toward our 2% objective has resumed my confidence has grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Fed Chair Powell indicates interest rate cuts ahead: 'The time has come for policy to adjust'<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> think the economy will get back  to 2% while maintaining a strong labor market. let's listen to the chairman.  >> our objective has been to  restore price stability  maintaining a strong labor  market, avoiding the sharp  increases in unemployment that  characterized earlier  disinflationary episodes when  inflation expectations were less well anchored. while the task is not complete,  we have made a good deal of  progress toward that outcome. today, i will begin by  addressing the current economic  situation in the path ahead for  monetary policy. i will then turn to a discussion of economic events since the  pandemic arrived, exploring why  inflation rose to levels not  seen in a generation, and why it has fallen so much while  unemployment has remained low. so let's begin with the current  situation and the near-term  outlook for policy. for much of the past three years inflation ran well above our 2%  goal and labor market conditions were extremely tight. the fomc's primary focus has  been on bringing down inflation  and appropriately so. prior to this episode most  americans alive today had not  experienced the pain of high  inflation for a sustained  period. inflation brought substantial  hardship, especially for those  least able to meet the higher  costs of essentials like food,  housing, and transportation. high inflation triggered sense  and a sense of unfairness that  linger today. while restrictive monetary  policy helped restore balance  between aggregate supply and  demand, easing inflationary  pressures and ensure that  inflation expectations remained  well anchored. inflation is now much closer to  our objective with prices having risen 2.5% over the past 12  months. after a pause earlier this year, progress toward our 2% objective has resumed. my confidence has grown that  inflation is on a sustainable  path back to 2%. in the years just prior to the  pandemic, we saw the significant benefits to society that can  come from a long period of  strong labor market conditions,  low unemployment, high  participation, historically low  employment gaps and with  inflation low and stable,  healthy, real wage gains that  were increasingly concentrated  among those with lower incomes. the labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state. the unemployment rate began to  rise over a year ago and is now  at 4.3%. low by historical standards but  almost a full percentage point  above its level in early 2023. most of that increase has come  over the past six months. so far rising unemployment has  not been the result of elevated  layoffs, and is typically the  case in an economic downturn. rather, the increase mainly  reflects a substantial increase  in the supply of workers and the slow down from the previously  frantic pace of hiring. even so, the cooling in labor  market conditions is  unmistakable. job gains remain solid, but have slowed this year. job vacancies have fallen and  the ratio of unemployment has  returned to its prepandemic  range. the hiring and quits rates are  now below the level that  prevailed in 2018 and '19. nominal wage gains have  moderated and all told, labor  market conditions are now less  tight than just before the  pandemic in 2019, a year when  inflation ran below 2%. it seems unlikely that the labor market will be a source of  elevated inflationary pressures  any time soon. we do not seek or welcome  further cooling in labor market  conditions. overall, the economy continues  to grow at a solid pace, but the inflation in labor market data  show an evolving situation. the upside have diminished and  the downside risks to employment have increased. as we highlighted in our last  fomc statement, we are attentive to the risks to both sides of  our dual mandate. the time has come for policy to  adjust. the direction of travel is clear and the timing and pace of rate  cuts will depend on incoming  data, the evolving outlook and  the balance of risks. we will do everything we can to  support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward  price stability. with an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint, there is  good reason to think that the  economy will get back to 2%  inflation while maintaining a  strong labor market. the current level of our policy  rate gives us ample room t<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Banks will continue to outperform if the Fed starts to cut and there's a soft landing: RBC's Cassidy<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> that could make a difference in  terms of how much they can  contribute. lot more next week. for now, let's move on to the  banks ahead of fed powell's  speech a little bit from now at  jackson hole. gerard cassidy, head of global  financials, he joins us now. when i look at, you know,  jpmorgan, gerard, or bank of  america or even citi, i mean,  goldman-sachs, pretty good years for the stocks. as we get ready, potentially,  for rates to decline, are we  going to see any significant  response from these banks? >> david, it's going to be  interesting, because as you  pointed out, many of these  stocks have had good years so  far. year-to-date performance,  generally, for the banks, has  outperformed the standard &  poor's 500, so i think what the  stocks are doing is anticipating the fed will cut rates. it will be beneficial to the  banks and we'll start to see an  improvement in their revenue  growth as loan demand comes back in the economy that many of us  expect to be a so-called soft  landing. so, if you go back in time and  look at a last time on the only  time, i think, in our careers  that there was a soft landing,  it was 1995, and that year, the  bank stocks already moved that,  you know, in the beginning of  the year, that they were up 55%  in 1995, best-performing sector  in the s&p that year, because of the soft landing and the  expectations going into '95 that there was going to be a  recession, which never showed  up. so, i don't expect that kind of  dramatic increase, but they  should continue to outperform if we do get the fed to cut rates  and we do have a soft landing. >> and where are you in that  camp? you believe her, then, and  therefore a believer that  there's more upside for many of  these big banks? >> we are a believer, david. and i think the reason being is  though the employment picture  has softened a bit, employment  is still very healthy. the unemployment rate, at 4.3%,  thereabouts, is still a strong  rate, relative to history. now, relative to recent history, of course, it's higher, but  these are strong levels. the consumer, the balance sheet  is in good shape, as are most  corporate balance sheets, and if the fed does start to get rates, generally, that's been positive  for the net interest margins,  which have been a challenge to  the banks. >> when trump's odds were going  up a few weeks ago after the  debate, after the assassination  attempt, the banks were  rallying, and people were saying because of the odds of a trump  and red sweep would be good for  banks, and deregulation. is the election a swing factor  now that things are looking a  little more even in the polls? does this matter for banks,  ultimately, and what we expect  from basel iii and everything  else? >> sara, it's an interesting  observation, because you're  right. after the debate and then the  assassination, trump had an  upswing and it was a trump  factor in the banks as you  described, and it was very  dramatic when he won back in  2016 because of the deregulation as well as cutting tax rates,  and even if he was to win, it's  a hard one to call, of course,  it just won't be as positive as  the past -- his past term, but  it would be more positive than  the current administration,  who's kind of, you know, held  back on a number of areas,  particularly when it comes to  mergers and acquisitions. but you brought up something  else quite interesting, which is basel iii end game, and that is  the critical regulatory piece  that needs to be finalized. it came out in july of '23. everybody pushed back on it. now, what's happening is we  think they're rewriting it. we'll get a new proposal, which  will be less onerous for the big banks, and once that comes out,  maybe we'll get it before the  election, just the new proposal, not the implementation, and then the banks can really have an  understanding of what kind of  capital they need, a<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> entering a new phase. vice president harris wrapping  up the democratic national  convention last evening with her presidential nomination  acceptance speech. megan cassella joins us from  chicago, been covering this for  us and has more this morning. good morning, megan. >> good morning from chicago  where we have made it to friday. democrats are a few miles from  here are breaking down the  united center after that fourth  and final night of the  convention wrapped up and it was as big of a party as we saw from the democrats all week long. it was a mix of celebrities and  elected officials giving  speeches, and there was somewhat of a focus, more than any other  night, on themes of foreign  policy, on the need to keep the  u.s. secure and on standing up  to dictators. vice president harris touched on all of that in her speech. it was one part buying frooe. she connected that to her policy agenda and started to elaborate  at least a little bit on some of those economic plans we've been  talking about all week. take a listen. >> i will bring together labor  and workers and small business  owners and entrepreneurs and  american companies to create  jobs, to grow our economy, and  to lower the cost of everyday  needs like health care and  housing and groceries. we will provide access to  capital for small business  owners and entrepreneurs and  founders. >> harris then went on to talk  about issues that were meant to  shore up her moderate policy  credentials a little bit more. she spoke about the need for a  bipartisan border agreement and  working with republicans to get  that done. she spoke about standing up to  russia and iran, and she sort of struck a little bit of a  both-sides position on israel  and gaza. she said that the u.s. will  always protect israel's right to defend itself, but she also  called for a ceasefire and said  that palestinians also deserve  the right to freedom and  security. so, overall, guys, she was sort  of looking to make an outreach  or make an appeal to moderate or independent voters who might be  undecided about who to vote for  in november. listen to this. >> i know there are people of  various political views watching tonight, and i want you to know, i promise to be a president for  all americans. >> now, one of the main mejz we  heard from center stage was for  democrats not to get complacent  or overconfident. they have to keep putting in the work between now and november. harris has just about ten weeks  left. we're going to have to hear her  laying out more of a policy  agenda. she'll have to start answering  more media questions. the hard part is really coming  from here. >> okay, megan cassella, thank  you very much. what'd you think of the speech? >> i actually thought it was a  decent speech, personally. it kind of more or less kept me  interested. a loat of generalities, i think  is the general review in terms  of specific policies, i guess  not unexpected that you wouldn't get specific policies down to  any sort of granular level in a  speech like that. but to your point earlier, sara, that's sort of what we're going  to be waiting for. whether or not we get it, i  think, remains unclear. it may be viewed by the  democrats as an opportunity to  sort of keep talking about  things at a 10,000-foot level as opposed to getting more granular on certain issues. >> some of the write-ups today  talk about how she really didn't mention her race or her gender,  not leaning heavily on that. wasn't afraid to go into  immigration and the economy and  reproductive rights. as far as the economy goes, it's going to be interesting to see  where the debate settles on the  important states. take a state like north  carolina, which is newly in  play, some argue. interesting piece on the tape  this week looking at how incomes there have surpassed the  national average under biden's  white house. employment's lower than the  national average. we've talked about datacenter  spending. that's a big north carolina  story. so, how does that work? >> some of the policy specifics  that we do have, though, wall  street is starting to crunch the numbers. for instance, a raise in the  corporate tax rate to 28%,  according to the cbo, would hurt profits by $10 billion annually. so, that's something to think  about if they get both houses. anyway, we're going to talk  about it. >> less than a quarter for  apple. >> yeah. it has an effect. >> it's like a mon<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> what the academic studies show is that industry by industry when you see more competition which suggests more pricing power what we saw is that profit margins went up and that's the problem we've got is that states have tools to deal with this locally but right now we want to make sure that the ftc has the tools to do it nationally and that the states that don't have price gouging laws also have access to those same tools we have an in the same way in the same way that the ftc for example has tools to be able to deal with deceptive pricing uh and deceptive uh advertising it should have the ability to deal with price gouging<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> LIVE: Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks at the 2024 Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium — 8/23/2024<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> that all right um good morning um thank you and um welcome to the first day of sessions for the federal reserve bank of kansas city jackson hall economic symposium my name is um karen dinan and i'm going to be your moderator for today's sessions um as as you heard last night from jeff the topic for the symposium uh is reassessing the effectiveness in transmission of monetary policy so uh it's a super important topic particularly right now and um we've got some great papers lined up for this morning we've got two papers and we also have a panel lined up for that um but before we get to any of that i am um delighted to say that we have federal reserve chair uh j pal here to deliver um opening remarks so um with that let me welcome uh j pal to the podium thank you karen and thanks to our host from the kansas city fed it's it's great to be back here today uh four and a half years after co 19's arrival the worst of the pandemic related economic distortions are fading inflation has declined significantly the labor market is no longer overheated and conditions are now less tight than those that prevailed before the pandemic supply constraints have normalized and the balance of risks to our two mandates has changed our objective has been to restore price stability while maintaining a strong labor market avoiding the sharp increases in unemployment that characterized earlier disinflationary episodes when inflation expectations were less well anchored while the task is not complete we have made a good deal of progress toward that outcome today i will begin by addressing the current economic situation and the path ahead for monetary policy i will then turn to a discussion of economic events since the pandemic arrived exploring why inflation rose to levels not seen in a generation and why it has fallen so much while unemployment has remained low so let's begin with the current situation and the near near-term outlook for policy for much of the past three years inflation ran well above our 2 % goal and labor market conditions were extremely tight the fomc's primary focus has been on bringing down inflation and appropriately so prior to this episode most americans alive today had not experienced the pain of high inflation for a sustained period inflation brought substantial substantial hardship especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food housing and transportation high inflation triggered stress and a sense of unfairness that linger today our restrictive monetary policy helped restore balance between aggregate supply and demand easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remained well anchored inflation is now much closer to our objective with prices having risen 2.5% over the past 12 months after a pause earlier this year progress toward our 2% objective has resumed my confidence has grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2% turning to employment in the years just prior to the pandemic we saw the significant benefits to society that can come from a long period of strong labor market conditions low unemployment high participation historically low racial employment gaps and with inflation low and stable healthy real wage gains that were increasingly concentrated among those with lower incomes today the labor market has cooled considerably from its formerly overheated state the unemployment rate began to rise over a year ago and is now at 4.3% still low by historical standards but almost a full percentage point above its level in early 2023 most of that increase has come over the past 6 months so far rising unemployment has not been the result of elevated layoffs as is typically the case in an economic downturn rather the increase mainly reflects a substantial increase in the supply of workers and a slow down from the previously frantic pace of hiring even so the cooling in labor market conditions is unmistakable job gains remain solid but have slowed this year job vacancies have fallen and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment has returned to its pre-pandemic range the hiring and quits rates are now below the levels that prevailed in 2018 and 19 nominal wage gains have moderated and all told labor market conditions are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019 a year when inflation ran below 2% it seems unlikely that the labor market will be a source of elevated inflationary pressures anytime soon we do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions overall all the continue the economy continues to grow at a solid pace but the inflation and labor market data show an evolving situation the upside risks to inflation have diminished and the downside risks to employment have increased as we highlighted in our last fomc statement we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate the time has come for policy to adjust the direction of travel is clear and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks we will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability with an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2% inflation while maintaining a strong labor market the current level of our policy rate gives us ample room to respond to any risks we may face including the risk of unw welcome further weakening in labor market conditions so let's now turn to the questions of why inflation rose and why it has fallen so significantly even as unemployment has remained low there's a growing body of research on these questions including g ederson's work which we'll shortly discuss uh and this is a good time for this discussion it is of course too soon to make definitive assessments this period will be analyzed and debated long after we are all gone the arrival of the covid-19 pandemic led quickly to shutdowns in economies around the world it was a time of radical uncertainty and severe downside risks as so often happens in times of crisis americans adapted and innovated governments responded with extraordinary force especially in the united states congress unanimously passed the cares act at the fed we used our powers to an unprecedented extent to stabilize the financial system and help stave off an economic depression after a historically deep but brief recession in mid 2020 the economy began to grow again and as the risks of a severe extended downturn receded and as the economy reopened we faced the risk of replaying the painfully slow recovery that followed the global financial crisis congress delivered substantial additional fiscal support in late 2020 and again in early 2021 spending recovered strongly in the first half of 2021 and the ongoing pandemic shaped the pattern of the recovery lingering concerns over covid weighed on spending on in-person services but pent up demand stimulative policies pandemic changes in work and leisure practices and the additional savings associated with constrained services spending all contributed to a historic surge in consumer spending on goods the pandemic also wreaked havoc on supply conditions 8 million people left the workforce at its onset and the size of the labor force was still 4 million below its pre-pandemic level in early 2021 the labor force would not return to its pre-pandemic trend until mid 2023 supply chains were snarled by a combination of lost workers disrupted international trade linkages and tectonic shifts in the composition and level of demand clearly this was nothing like the slow recovery after the global financial crisis enter inflation after running below target through 2020 inflation spiked in march and april 2021 the initial burst of inflation was concentrated rather than broad-based with extremely large price increases for goods and short supply such as motor vehicles my colleagues and i judged at the outset that these pandemic related factors would not not be persistent and thus that the sudden rise in inflation was likely to pass through fairly quickly without the need for a monetary policy response in short that the inflation would be transitory standard thinking has long been that as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored it can be appropriate for central banks to look through a temporary rise in inflation the good ship transitory was a crowded one with most mainstream analysts and advanced economy central bankers on board i think i see some for former shipmates out there today the common expectation was that supply conditions would improve reasonably quickly that the rapid recovery in demand would run its course and that demand would rotate back from goods to services bringing inflation down for a time the data were consistent with the transitory hypothesis monthly readings for core inflation declined every month from april through september 2021 although progress came slower than expected the case began to weaken around midyear as was reflected in our communications and beginning in october the data turned hard against the transitory hypothesis inflation rose and broadened out from goods to services and it became clear that high inflation was not transitory and that it would require a strong response if inflation expectations were to remain well anchored we recognized that and pivoted beginning in november financial conditions began to tighten uh and after phasing out our asset purchases we lifted off in march of 20 2022 by early 2022 headline inflation exceeded 6% and core was above 5% new supply shocks appeared russia's invasion of ukraine led to a sharp increase in energy and commodity prices the improvements in supply conditions and the rotation in demand from goods to services were taking much longer than expected in part due to further covid waves in the united states and co continued to disrupt production globally in including through new and extended lockdowns in china higher rates of inflation were a global phenomenon reflecting common experiences rapid increases in the demand for goods strained supply chains tight labor markets and sharp hikes in commodity prices the global nature of inflation was unlike any period since the 1970s back then high inflation became entrenched an outcome we were utterly committed to avoiding by mid 2022 the labor market was extremely tight with employment increasing by 6 and a half million jobs from the middle of 2021 this increase in labor demand was met in part by workers rejoining the labor force as health concerns began to fade but labor supply remained constrained and in the summer of 2022 labor force participation remained well below pre-pandemic level there were nearly twice as many job openings as unemployed persons from march 2022 through the end of the year signaling a severe labor shortage and inflation peaked at 7.1% in june 2022 at this podium two years ago i discussed the possibility that addressing inflation could bring some pain in the form of higher unemployment and slower growth some argued that getting inflation under control would require a recession and a lengthy period of high unemployment and i expressed our unconditional commitment to fully restoring price stability and to keeping at it until the job is done the fomc did not flinch from carrying out our responsibilities and our actions forcefully demonstrated our commitment to restoring price stability we raised our policy rate by 425 basis points in 2022 and another 100 basis points in 2023 and we've held our policy rate at its current restricted level restrictive level since july 2023 the summer of 2022 proved to be the peak of inflation the 4 and a half percentage point decline in inflation from its peak two years ago has occurred in a context of low unemployment a welcome and historically unusual result so how did inflation fall without a sharp rise in unemployment above its estimated natural rate pandemic related distortions to supply and demand as well as severe shocks to energy and commodity markets were important driver of high inflation and their reversal has been a key part of the story of its decline the unwinding of these factors took much longer than expected but ultimately played a large role in the subsequent disinflation our restrictive monetary policy contributed to a moderation in aggregate demand which combined with improvements in aggregate supply to reduce inflationary pressures while allowing growth to continue at a healthy pace as labor demand also moderated the historically high high level of vacancies relative to unemployment has normalized primarily through a decline in vacancies without sizable and disruptive layoffs bringing the labor market to a state where it is no longer a source of inflationary pressures a word on the critical importance of inflation expectations standard economic models have long reflected the view that inflation will return to its objective when product and labor markets are balanced without the need for economic slack so long as inflation expectations are anchored at our objective that's what the model said but the stability of longer run inflation expectations since the 2000s had not been tested by a persistent burst of high inflation it was far from assured that the inflation anchor would hold concerns over de anchoring contributed to the view that disinflation would require slack in the economy and specifically in the labor market an important takeaway from recent experience is that anchored inflation exp expectations reinforced by vigorous central bank actions can facilitate this inflation without the need for slack this narrative attributes much of the increase in inflation to an extraordinary collision between overheated and temporarily distorted demand and constrain supply while researchers differ in their approaches and to some extent in their conclusions a consensus seems to be emerging which i see as attributing most of the rise in inflation to this collision all told the healing from pandemic distortions our efforts to moderate aggregate demand and the anchoring of expectations have worked together to put inflation on what increasingly appears to be a sustainable path to our 2% objective disinflation while preserving labor market strength is only possible with anchored inflation expectations which reflect the public's confidence that the central bank will bring about 2% inflation over time that confidence has been built over decades and reinforced by our actions that is my assessment of events your mileage may differ so let me wrap up by emphasizing that the pandemic economy has proved to be unlike any other and that there remains much to be learned from this extraordinary period our statement on longer run goals and monetary policy strategy emphasizes our commitment to reviewing our principles and making appropriate adjustments through a thorough public review every 5 years as we begin in this process later this year we will be open to criticism and new ideas while preserving the strengths of our framework the limits of our knowledge so clearly evident during the pandemic demand humility and a questioning spirit focused on learning lessons from the past and applying them flexibly to our current challenges thank you<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Economy isn't slowing down in a way that justifies the number of rate cuts: Apollo's Torsten Slok<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> the entire ecosystem at this  point, and from what i can tell, nothing is giving, so to speak. >> joining us this morning here  onset, we have torsen slok and  michael. good to see you guys, happy  friday. t, you have been so constructive on the economy at large. you put out notes every week,  arguing the economy, in your  words, is just fine. >> well, as david was just  saying, the guidance in terms of capex is still quite strong. the magnificent seven, their  investment in capex has been  very strong so on the firm side, businesses are still spending. the a.i. tailwind is very  strong. on the consumer side, there are  issues where it comes to  consumers that are highly  indebted and impacted by high  interest rates but across the  board, the latest retail sales  were strong, gdp in the second  quarter was 2.8 and if you look  at the labor market, there are  no signs of layoffs, so it  brings you to the conclusion,  where is the slowdown everyone  is talking about? i do understand immigration is  going up, but broadly speaking,  it's just not clear to me that  the economy's slowing down this  way that justifies four rate  cuts the way the market is  pricing at the moment. >> michael, how does your view  rhyme with torsten if at all,  and what does it mean for the  stock market? >> well, i think it's a very  bifurcated backdrop still, and i think we're seeing more weakness creep up from the bottom half  than strength trickle down from  the high-end consumer or  businesses. so, you know, i think we can  corroborate all this macrodata,  which i think, you know, there's a enough strong data and enough  weak data to pick your own  narrative, but if you look at  the earnings data, and  particularly mid cap and small  cap stocks, the most  economically sensitive groups,  their estimates continue to  fall. in fact, estimates for this year are now below realized earnings  of 2023, and 2025 earnings are  also continuing to come down. that said, large cap stocks,  which have certainly been the  strength of the market, their  earnings continue to remain  resilient, and they will be the  last to fall and won't fall  until we really see a more -- a  bigger decline in the labor  market. >> and that's what we're seeing, torsten, to push back on your  view. unemployment rate is up. job openings are down. sentiment surveys are pointing  to weakness. that's the thing that the fed is focused on. >> well, but if you look at  layoffs in the j.o.l.t.s.  survey, the lowest level since  2001. no one's getting fired. same thing in the christmas  survey of job cut announcements. it's trending down. if you look at the notices, it's suggesting that jobless claims  will be lower over the next two  months so the very important  nuance in this debate about the  labor market is that there is  weakness, but that weakness is  mainly becoming an issue because labor supply is growing. it's not because people are  getting fired. all indicators of layoffs are at record low levels, so in that  sense, firms are not laying off  workers, so where is this  recession so many people are  worried about? >> i mean, with the consumer,  there's definitely signs of  slowing. >> well, hold on. target this week reported that  everything was fine. >> that's a value play. >> walmart was saying there's no broad-based --  >> where do you go when times  are tough? you go to target and walmart and trade down  >> weekly data from redbook on  same store retail sales, it is  misguided that the consumer is  crashing. >> not crashing, but i have a  chart on delinquencies for  credit card loans and it's way  up. >> that's only for certain  segments of consumers. in the aggregate, consumers were just fine. i mean, i think the message  today from jay powell, very  importantly, will be that, yes,  number one, we are cutting in  september. >> there's my chart. >> but after that, we will begin to see more evidence that the  data is maybe not as bad as  we're expecting, and i think he  also will clearly say, we just  don't know yet what will happen  after september. i completely understand the idea that we may be above, may be  restrictive as you talked about  earlier, but the question is,  are we in a hurry to cut rates a lot? and the answer to that is,  absolutely not. >> michael, remind me, is the  house view at piper net bearish? is recession your base case? >> our economist, nancy lazard,  does see recession beginning in  the fourth quarter. our view on equities, we've been bullish since october of 2023 on the view that we're going to  have softylocks, which is a  moderation of economic activity  and lower inflation and lower  rates would be very good for  equities. we changed that view at the end  of july with the view that  inflation here has been largely  priced out, and obviously, we've priced in a ton of fed rate cuts and now we're going to be more  focused on growth data, activity data, and i think we're going to see, and what we've seen in the  last month is we're going to see more of this is a lot of  realized volatility in the  market. when we get good data, we're  going to get relief because  there's budding recession fear. but if we see bad data, we're  going to see the markets sell  off equally as sharply, so we're seeing all -- i disagree with  torsten's kind of binary view  that everything's all great. and again, i think we can look  to the markets, and it doesn't  have to be a binary answer, but  if you look at market  leadership, we continue to see  leadership in higher quality  stocks, companies with good  interest coverage, high  profitability, better  fundamentals. that's not the type of  leadership you would be seeing  if the economy was strengthening or strong. it's quite the opposite,  historically speaking. >> one final word? >> well, one final word, of  course, is that remember what  creates recessions is normally a shock to the economy and that  was covid, the financial crisis, the i.t. bubble bursting. what is the shock to the economy today? it's the fed has raised rates. we've been waiting for literally go and a half years for godot to arrive and the economy begins to slow down, why should it slo<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Evercore's Roger Altman on the Fed's inflation fight, state of the economy and Harris' DNC speech<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> raphael bostic just told us the  risks to both sides of the fed's mandate are coming back into  balance. that interview came ahead of  this morning's main event, a  10:00 a.m. eastern speech by fed chair powell. joining us now is roger altman. this has been a time that -- i  think it was last year, here was the quote. two years ago from powell in  jackson hole, "we will keep at  it until we are confident the  job is done." of course then he was talking  about inflation and the market  has often had kind of a soggy  reaction to his jackson hole  remarks, but is it potentially  going to be very different this  time around? >> a little bit different  because i see the fed right now  as labor first, meaning that  it's more confident of the  trajectory of inflation than it  is the trajectory of labor  markets, and at the margin, more concern about labor markets  underperforming than about  inflation underperforming. inflation, after all, and i  listened carefully to  mr. bostic's remarks, is  trending just where -- toward  where the fed would want. is it a guarantee that it hits  the fed's 2% long-term target? no. but it's got momentum towards  that. core pce, ex-shelter, is already at 2%. labor markets, a little more  volatile. we saw that large revision,  which means that average monthly job growth has been slower than  we thought the it had been, and  it's very hard to pull off a  soft landing the way the fed is  trying to do, although they look like they can do it, so i think  at the margin, the fed is more  oriented towards labor markets,  which means more inclined to  cut, and i do think that the  basic scenario of three cuts, 25 basis points each between now  and the rest of the year is the  base case. >> you know, yesterday, we were  having this debate about whether they should cut by half a point, and a couple of reasons for that would be, number one, that rates are so much higher now that as a percentage of where they are,  it's not as big as it might be  later on if you had to do more  of playing catch-up. more importantly, inflation  expectations are down since the  spring, and bostic himself just  said, to see that passive  tightening is not the fed's  goal, and passive tightening via lower inflation is a thing, so  inflation is coming down,  inflation expectations are  coming down. even as you said this inflation  dashboard is flashing red, you  could make the case for a half  point cut as potentially leading to a better economic outcome,  especially if you need more  hiring right now. >> yes, but i think if the  decision were today, the  september 18th meeting were  actually today, it's much more  likely that they'd do 25 basis  points because they'd like, i  think, to be consistent and  smooth about it if they could. and so i think that's more  likely at the moment, but if we  see, for example, a  disappointing print on jobs and  the unemployment rate, and other aspects of labor markets, yes,  50 basis points could come into  play as you suggest. >> roger, we had an interview  with senator warren and i went  back to the way that the price  control or price gouging or  whatever you want to call it,  the way that was received, and i think it was fair to say that  you had some criticism from both sides of the aisle, "the  washington post" said it's a  gimmick, we need real solutions. jason furman said not only is it policy that won't work, it could actually be counterproductive. i just want you to weigh in. we can acknowledge that the  pandemic caused supply to be  tight. there was a lot of stimulus that caused demand to be very high  while at the same time supply  was tight. that's enough of an explanation  right there, i think, for what  happened. do you think -- how much of the  40-year highs in inflation was  caused by corporations taking  advantage of that situation and  being able to gouge on prices? i'm just wondering if you're  someone who thinks --  >> in my view, joe, very little. it is true that grocery margins  during the pandemic rose above  long-term historical levels and  haven't fully returned, haven't  fully come down. >> they're at pre-pandemic or  pre-2019 levels, my colleague  sara eisen --  >> well, i've seen other data. >> well, what are the margins  now? >> in any event, my answer is  very little. >> okay. >> and i view the proposal, you  know, the first ever ban on  price gouging at grocery, i view that essentially as jawboning. that would not pass the  congress, whatever the make-up  of the congress is. the harris campaign knows that. so, it's a form of jawboning,  which is a very old, tried and  true technique, essentially  saying, we're going to watch  very closely as to the pattern  of grocery prices. but let's step back a second. i thought that she struck, last  night, a bit of a surprisingly  centrist tone. she was very hawkish on border  security and on national  security, send me the langford  bill, i'll sign it. her comments on north korea,  very hawkish and then her basic  proposals and expanded child  care tax credit, deeper  incentives to increase the  supply of housing in this  country, and expanded earned  income tax credit, including  low-income childless workers and finally continuing the enhanced  subsidies for buying insurance  under the affordable care act,  these are very appealing to the  middle class. i personally s<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic: Can't wait until inflation is at 2% to start moving<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> yell. should be fun today.  >> close, and could end up in  fisticuff end of the day. start with this question here,  raphael. does it feelto you like taking  in all the data out there, all  of the economic data, that this  is a turning point here in fed  policy? >> well, i do think that. i think it's safe to say that in the sense that for two years now the inflation part of the  mandate has really been the main focal point, and as inflation  has come down, as unemployment  has come up, risks to both sides of or mandate have come much  more into balance, and we're  going to have to think hard  about sort of what's happening  in labor markets so that we can  try to get to that illusive  calm, orderly return to  normalization.  >> i was looking at the tail of  the tape. count it from november of '2'21  30 months. is that over? about to be in a process of  normalizing rates from  restrictive to less restrictive? >> i think we're close. look, at the very beginning of  this i said we could have to  raise rates, stay at a high  level for a long time.  >> right.  >> we've been there for a long  time and now the numbers are  starting to move in a direction  which suggests that our policy  has had its effect and we can  start the pathway back to a  normal policy posture. look, we can't wait until  inflation is at 2% itself to  start moving. inflation's come way down  telling me we have to really  think hard about this. on the other hand, we've had a  lot of positive momentum in  labor markets. that momentum seems to be easing up a bit, and that means that it is a sign that we're getting  back to a much more normalized  place.  >> i wonder how much currency  utinto the arguments that floats around in hallways here, which  is that right now the federal  reserve on a real federal  reserve funds rate, which is an  inflation adjusted funds rate,  because the funds rate has not  come down. inflation come down pun know the argument. how much currency do you put on  the idea more restrictive now  than when you raised to 538 and  no matter what's happen, almost  no matter what's happened in the economy you need to be less  res restrictive? >> a case to be made. i've talked about passive  tightening more than year ago. i believe that's a thing. for me i think the biggest issue and focus i've had is, is  inflation sustainably moving  back to its 2% target? for the first part of this year, it was clear it was. now for me i've really tried  much as possible to get that  sense. i'll say the numbers in the last couple of months have come in  quite positive. made me more confident about  that and hopeful the next two  months worth of data points  continue that pathway, because  then it would say, we're moving  there. one last thing i would point  out, though. if you look at where inflation  is, it is not particularly close to our target. we have an underlying inflation  dashboard on our website. it's all flashing red still. it is not as red as it was  before. bright, bright red, but we still have a ways to go and i don't  think it's in our interest or in anyone's interest to just assume thatful we're done, and so we  don't have to worry about it. so that's the other part that i  think everyone needs to be  mindful of.  >> i get that. which is why i sort of asked  about this passive tightening  thing. it's not really that you're at  or near target. it's that you have scope to  become less restrictive but  still putting downward pressure  on both the economy and  inflation, even if, for example, you get upside surprise of .3  versus .2 because you're already on the way there and already  have restrictiveness in the  funds rate right now? >> the argument, makes total  sense. i foetotally agree with that. i would say inflation has come  down faster than i expected. for me it says it may be  appropriate to full forward our  first rate move. i was fourth quarter, my outlook for the fourth quarter for quite some time.  >> only one cut.  >> one cut. right.  >> has that changed now? >> it is in play. you know, we -- in a couple of  weeks, we'll have to do another  sep and as part of that i will  come to a more definitive view  because i have to put a number  in the table.  >> do you want to whisper the  number to me now? >> not right now. maybe in a couple weeks i'll  call you.  >> okay. it sure.  >> i think that you can't ignore the data. the data has come in in a way  which would suggest that it's  going to be appropriate to be  closer to moving than further. and for me, i just want to make  sure that the next couple of  data points are consistent with  that, and then we'll see where  we are.  >> is the unemployment rate  higher than you previously  forecast? >> it is. >> meaningfully so? >> i wouldn't is a meaningfully  so's in that the rate is still  by historical standards below. right? we don't have a crisis in labor  markets. the way i describe them is,  they're weakening but not weak. i want to try to remind people. right before the pandemic we had one of the tightest labor  markets that people had --  >> before the pandemic.  >> before the pandemic.  >> then lost a million people.  >> and then it became super  acute. easing is coming off that super  acute environment  >> sure.  >> for me the thing to look at  for now is whether that  weakening is accelerating in  such a way that it isstarting  to move closer to weakness. not what we're seeing now. i talk to businesses all the  time. they tell me that while they are more luke warm about hiring new  workers, they don't have in  their outlook laying people off. >> right.  >> as the modal thing.  >> how did the 818,000 revision  affect your view of the job  market? >> it didn't really change it  that much. our folks told me the world is  changing in ways. a lot of data collection  techniques --  >> need to do better.  >> it's just hard.  >> right.  >> right? and so they were telling me  there's going to be a revision. whatever the number is, you  should not assume that it's  telling you a different story  than what we're hearing from the hundreds of businesses and  leaders across the industry.  >> quick. the market is priced for four  rate cuts this year. or 100 basis points. 200 over time. i want to ask you what you think about how the market is priced,  but i'm also interested in this  idea. where do you frneed to get to? where should you be if you need  to provide stimulus to the  economy? in other words, how restrictive  do you think you are? >> i think we're riestrictive. earlier in the week i was people in the housing industry. talk to them, very restrictive.  >> help, help! >> and not really a lot of  ambiguity or debate on that  point. i to think restrictiveness is  real but a lot of momentum in  the economy because of how re  experienced the pandemic and a  lot of our restrictiveness has  been trying to sap that up so  we're back to a more normal type of economic environment. look, i think we're in a pretty  good place right now. but i don't assume anything is  going to stay that way.  >> 100, is that crazy for this  year? 200 crazy in a full year? >> let me say this --  the markets have been eager to  get us to be finished. and for me, i think we have to  really remind ourselves that the u.s. economy doesn't move that  quickly, and that patience is  going to be warranted. the other part for me is, we've  seen through the last two and a  half years the unexpected, seems to routinely happen. so just have to keep eye mys  open for that and <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Sen. Warren on Harris' price gouging plan: Consumers need to know they've got somebody on their side<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> to give specifics on the vice  president's plan to, and price  gouging, or actually put on  price controls, basically. our next guest worked with  harris on an anti-price gouging  bill in 2020 during the  pandemic. a similar bill was re-introduced in the senate earlier this year. joining us now, massachusetts  democratic senator elizabeth  warren. senator, you're famous from last night. you were already famous but even more famous from last night. kind of a pretty nice moment for you, i have to say. >> well, it was a moment for me  about democracy. why all of these people had  shown up, because they want to  be in the fight, and they want  to be in the fight, because they want to see an america where  they can afford to pay for their prescription drugs. see an america where their kids  can afford to go to college  without getting crushed by  student loan debt. they want to see an america  strengthening social security  not as donald trump did, propose four budgets in a row that cut  it. i saw this as a roomful of  volunteers who are in the fight  all the way, and i loved that.  >> senator, i actually wish,  actually wish donald trump would consider doing something to  entitlements and stuff but i  don't think that's really the  case. senator, the price gouging. >> but -- you have to  remember -- let's do remember he did try. four times in a row.  >> i wish he would and to  actually -- maybe move it out to 70 or 75. something's got to be done. it's going toble  be untenable. lose the "washington post" as a  democrat you got serious  problems. what they said about the price  gouging, or the price control  legislation. it was both sides of the aisle,  even jason furman. i don't know if you saw some of  these c his comments. not good policy and can do more  harm than good. i can paint you a picture how  that would work and how it's  worked in the past, tried to  artificially hold prices down. competition doesn't come in. people don't -- like if beef is  too high, people don't move the  chicken. competitors don't come in to  undercut where the beef prices  are. nothing works when you try to  artificially control prices. it's just the supply and demand  issue. it's a flawed idea.  >> so do you have a question  here? >> yes. why would you propose a flawed  idea when the real problem --  >> let me ask you a question --  >> help the middle class. sincerely want to help people  having truck at the grocery  store it's not price gouging  that's the issue. and if you look at a seriously  and really want to help them,  let's do something about it. together. fine. >> i understand if you wanted to do a lecture about this, start  with where have you been? for the last 30 years, and three dozen states have price gouging  laws, and they have used them  effectively. states like texas and florida. they've used price gouging laws. price gouging laws are not price control. price gouging laws are to say,  you know, sometimes markets go  off the rails, and when they do, we need some ways to get them  back on the rails. we need some curves on that  behavior. so, for example, we watched in  the pandemic how prices went up  for a whole lot of reasons. they went up partly because we  had supply chain kinks. we had problems because of the  war in ukraine. that cut supplies of certain  commodities, and one of the  things that happened as a result of that is there were  corporations that said, whoa! now that we have inflation, now  that prices are up overall, this is a great opportunity for us to raise prices. not just in passing along costs, but to go way, way, way above  that. and how do we know that it was  way, way above just passing  along costs? look at what happened to their  profit margins. if they had just been passing  along costs profit margins would have stayed about the same, but  for some industries, some  companies, profit margins shot  up, and do you know where they  shot up most often? it was in companies, or in  industries where there was a lot of concentration, a lot of  market power. places where the market is not  functioning competitively. so you end up with some, you  remember all talked about egg  prices. you end up with something like a giant egg producer, cal-maine. and cal-maine raises the price  of eggs. their profit margins increased  by 718%. that's not just passing along  costs. >> senator -- that's a --  that's -- your example on kraft  is either --  >> are you -- you finished  first.  >> and any of the -- six  minutes.  >> already have price gouging.  >> can i tell you why those are  fallacious and misleading at  best and your kraft analogy,  please, let me tell you. kraft you say, 440% profit  increase. the example you used, the prior  quarter from the year before  they had a charge of 1.3 billion dollars, and an accounting  change which wiped out of  profits's then earned what they  normally -- let me finish now.  >> even -- you didn't let me  finish. look at the data. come on. we have economic study after  economic study.  >> this is the way it always  goes. >> when there is --  >> senator, 40 million eggs  destroyed by of the avian flu.  >> we're in an industry, we have seen much greater increases  in --  >> do you attribute the  inflation, what you think we  need to do to solve it.  >>> they are not random  one-offs, it is part of the  problem. when you've got companies that  are gouging consumers on prices, consumers need to know they've  got somebody on their side.  >> senator -- senator, trying to help -- we're trying to actually do --  >> 36 -- where were are you on 7 states that currently have price gouging.  >> this is kelly. can i clarify --  >>s this is the way you never  lose an argument because no one  can ever say anything back to  you. it's frustrating.  >> look at what a state of  emergency is declared. most part say prices go up 10 or 15% compared to before that  state of emergency you have to  pay a fine. on a national level, how exactly would this work? define the state of emergency? does it have to be declared on a national level? are you then talking about a 10  or 15% increase in prices versus prior to the declaration and  then companies pay a fine? fine. maybe applies in 1% of the  situations. this legislation still vague  making it sound like broad base  price controls imposed broadly  speaking's which of the two  systems is it? >> it is not price controls. this is about when the market  itself is not functioning. sometimes markets don't function because of a localized  emergency. a hurricane. a wildfire. flooding. and so in states that have these price gouging laws, they can  come in and say, look. you can do some price increases, but if you're going above a  certain level you have to be  able to justify it<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Media power struggle: Paramount deal in jeopardy?<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> skydance media demanding  paramount stop negotiating with  edgar bronfman. this following a $6 billion for  national amusements and a stake  in paramount. for more, matt, good to see you  this morning. a lot of twists and turns  especially with bronfman jr. in  the picture. how serious and bitter should  markets take him as? >> depends who you ask. according to skydance not a  serious bidder. talk to people around hollywood, he is not as serious a bidder as the skydance group, which is  backed by david ellison and his  160 billion, $170 billion  fortune. talk to the bronfman side,  serious expertise behind us. looked at the deck last night. he has real people and happen 70 or so investors behind him  including for tritress and a co  others with serious money. depends who you ask here.  >> valuation-wise, why pay more  than skydance? i guess i'm trying to come to  you with is there a bit of  vanity aspect to this or  strategic, glad you saw the  deck, a strategic case to be  made for the valuation? and what his plans are contra  sky skydance's that could make  paramount for value able and  justify a competing offer? >> interesting, because the  pitch is very similar from the  bronfman group as the skydance  group. all say they're going to have  more efficiency. going to operate it better. they're going to bring tech  know-how. has tech-oriented people lined  up to bring a 100-year-old media and entertainment company into  the tech age and they're going  to have all sorts of  efficiencies. the money is essentially the  same. it's a little bit sweeter for  the shareholders on the bron-of- >>  bron-of-bronfman side. but then skydance offering  double the cash. a matter of inteof -- money for  shareholders might be more on  the bronfman side. a question how real the  financing is on the bronfman  side. he's claiming he has all of  these backers lined up, but we  don't know exactly where that  money is going to come from. on the skydance side we  absolutely know where that money is coming from. it's the ellison family and  redbird capital, which is very  well financed. an ability to close issue here. >> i mean is there any -- if we  sort of looking a the track  record. do shareholders then have to  take the best offer? or can more sort of analysis be  brought as to which one they  prefer? does it have to just come down  to sheer dollars? >> no. remember here that this is a  closely held company. shari redstone has enorthous  power here and clearly liked the skydance bid from the beginning. there was turbulence there. took months to get there but  ultimately she was comfortable. the question is whether this  bronfman bid is something that  will upend share -- shc shari's  will. the claim didn't specifically  ask for the go shop. something th<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Crypto industry accounts for nearly half of corporate spending in 2024 election<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> >> a lot more to come when it  comes to this story. >> absolutely.  >> thanks so much. see you later in the show.  >>> turn our attention to the  2024 race. vice president harris officially accepting the democratic party's presidential nomination last  night. harris using her speech vowing  to unite the country and  stressing that building the  middle class will be a defining  goal of her administration if  she is elected. >> i will bring together labor  and workers and small business  owners and entrepreneurs and  americans companies to create  jobs, to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries. we will provide access to  capital for small business  owners and entrepreneurs and  founders. >> with the conventions now in  the rear view mirror and harris  and former president trump  beginning that sprint to  november, the crypto industry is flexing its financial might to  have a real impact on the  election. we have much on this story. great to have you are here.  >> nearly half of all the  corporate money is coming in the crypto industry accord toeing a  new report from a non-public  watchdog group. koch industries is second place  as sector heavyweights as coin  base and ripple and ripple are  giving tens of millions apiece  to try to elect candidates  friendly to the industry. most of that corporate money  being raised is going to the  popular and bipartisan  pro-crypto super pac called  fairshake, one of the top  spending pacs this year. i spoke to get the for you  largest donors and its two  associated pacs. coin base was contributed $49  middle and a16z and ripple have  given $47 million and jump  crypto has put in $15 million, a total of $16 million with more  than 90% coming directly from  corporations. as to where the money is going,  a filing with the federal  election commission this week  showed that in july fairshake  dispersed $75 million and still  has 120 million still left to  deploy until the november  election.  >> big question, where is all  that money expected to go, and  the money they spent so far,  $75, is that having a real  impact? >> they have committed $25  million to 18 house candidates  in the general election, nine  democrats, nine republicans and  another $18 million going to  three senate races, and what's  interesting is so far to your  second point this has really  paid off, the strategy of  putting money behind pro-crypto  candidates. of the 42 primary races 36 of  the candidates that had the  pro-kp pro-crypto money behind won. the ads that put the money  behind, it was the standard  political jabs at the opposing  candidate. it's not shintaro ishihara u of  crypto situation voters, it's  that had a handful of businesses are spending money that it's  impossib<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> The margins of majorities in Congress will matter for both Trump and Harris: PIMCO's Libby Cantrill<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> watching the race for the white  house almost as closely as joe  with his countdown. for more on the proposed  policies and how they will  impact the economy, let's bring  in our next guest, libby  cantrill, head of u.s. public  policy at pimco. not to jump too far ahead, but  as people are -- the markets  have tightened between trump and harris. if she pulls this off, we were  speaking last hour with axios,  if she has congress, there is  some people who are focusing now on what would full democratic  control of the levers of power  so to speak mean for policy? could it actually be  substantially to the left of  this current sort of consensus  idea that we might effectively  have gridlock because everything is going to be so close.  >> it is a great point. i think that the numbers,  however, are going to be very  difficult. even if harris does win and she  does take congress with her, of  course. republicans now control the  house, by four seats. if democrats flip the house, it  is going to be by a similarly  narrow margin. and what we have seen is that  when you don't really have a  very large cushion, in terms of  votes, it is really difficult to govern. on the senate side, that's more  narrow. should democrats somehow keep  the senate and i think we still  believe that the odds favor  republicans taking back the  senate. democrats have a very bad senate map, as you probably talked  about. so, even if they have maybe a  majority in name, sort of  functionally, it is going to be  a very small majority and that's going to have a practical  limitation in terms of what can  get done.  >> we grasp at straws to find  market moving election to trump  trade. this is moving -- and it  probably at best is tenuous. but i really do believe if that  became in the market that it was going to be a democratic sweep,  i do not think the market would  be going up.  >> i think there would be -- i  think there would be concerns,  right? but this is what we have guided  our clients to is just that the  numbers matter. and if you have a 50/50 senate,  you can't functionally get a lot done. >> taxing unrealized gains is a  heavy lift.  >> if you just look at the stand alone bill that has been  introduced by senator widen, it  has ten co-sponsors. this is not a popular bill. this cdid not get out of  committee. this does not have the support  of the full senate.  >> do you see capital gains at  44.6%? >> i would say we have seen  democrats run on that platform. and we have not seen any  changes. i think it is going to be very  hard, given the narrow margins. we were talking about a 60/40  democratic senate, then maybe. if we're talking about 50/50  senate, which is the best --  that's the thing, that's the  best night for democrats. it would be a 50/50.  >> do you think the stock market or the underlying business  sentiment would change if  capital gains were taxed at  44.6%  44.6%? >> i think --  >> i'm wondering. there are people that argue it  doesn't matter.  >> there would be some sort of  income threshold. her plan is -- what have you. yeah, i think that what we know  from taxation is that it does  actually inform behavior. so, anyway, i think the reality  here is that even if there were  a democratic wave in quotes, it  would be by the smallest  margins. i can't sort of reinforce this  enough. 50/50 senate is not going to  lead to massive changes in the  tax cut.  >> why couldn't it be 51? you mentioned the tough map. a lot of focus on this. even with -- let's just say,  hypothetically she wins the top  of the ticket but republicans  still because of these  particular states and particular map they could still --  >> right now, it is 51/49,  democrats to republicans. the west virginia seat is lost. joe manchin is stepping down as  everybody knows. that will go republican. so then that is 50/50. is there a world where democrats can win the texas seat and the  florida seat? hypothetically. but that is a world where we  would have to see more of a  landslide election and none of  the indicators are pointing to  that. look at the generic ballot, or  look at enthusiasm levels. despite all of the good vibes  for harris, and she definitely  has stuck the landing in the  last few days, all of those are  pointing to an incredibly close  race. not only at the top of the  ballot, top of the ticket, but  also for the down ballots. >> what are the chances that  trump would get his way on  tariffs then. >> yeah. this is i think the difference,  though. it is a great point because  tariffs, yit is technically  fiscal policy. tariffs do not have to go  through the congress. he can do that unilaterally. we saw from the tariffs on  china, this 10% baseline tariff, there is a lot of kind of legal  scholars who are debating  whether he has jurisdiction over that. i think he would try to do that. so he does not need the  legislative body, he does not  need a cooperative congress in  terms of that. he doesn't need a cooperative  congress in forming policy. there are things the president  can do to move the economy that  doesn't go through congress, but capital gains increases, that  goes through congress. and, again this is where not  only do the majorities matter,  but the margins of the  majorities matter.  >> your job, what we have talked about, is 10% of what you need  to look at. the regulatory executive order  differences between a kamala  harris and donald trump, there  must be a million things to  think about in different parts  of the market, and different  parts of --  >> where we have seen --  >> clean energy, transition, net zero.  >> that's the area where we have seen the biggest differences in  terms of executive orders,  between a trump and biden. and the border, though, biden  sort of pivoted his border  policy and now has effectively  slowed --  >> we could do it now. he could close it now.  >> if you look at the number of  border crossings joe, as i'm  sure you have, it has decreased. >> we got ingest the 15 million  that are already here.  >> it is about the immigration  bill that wasn't passed.  >> on the regulatory side,  though, the market is looking at what a harris administration  could portend, it is important  to remember that 50/50 -- the  best that they can do is 50/50. we think odds favor a republican senate. that means that anybody who is  going to be nominated for th<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Former WH chief of staff Ron Klain: Harris is building a very broad coalition to tackle our problems<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> the convention this week and  talk about president biden's  legacy, former biden white house chief of staff ron klain. and we haven't seen even other  in a while. good to have you on this  morning. how many of the nights were you  sitting there, watching? >> i watched every night. i watched from home. political conventions are kind  of like nfl football games. it is fun to be there in the  stadium, but get a better view  sitting at home watching on tv. >> i think you're right. and, you know, you can get  commentary. we were at the olympics and i  love being at the events, but i, you know, there is a lot of  color and analysis and actually  just knowledge that comes in  from --  >> some events are better on tv. >> yes, some things are better  on tv. you were a great defender of the president and i'm wondering, do  you think any ill will, any hard feelings for how it turned out  for him? you know, he spoke so late that  night. and, you know, then wasn't even  there. just what are your comments on  how you think he and the first  lady are feeling at this point? >> they're feeling very  enthusiastic about vice  president harris' candidacy. i talked to him after his speech on monday night, he was proud of his speech, he made a strong  case for vice president harris. he talked to her, before her  speech on thursday, to give her  a pep talk. she didn't need it, but she got  it anyway, and she did a great  job last night, selling herself, selling her case, to the  country. i think we had a fantastic  convention. i think democrats leave chicago  incredibly energized by our new  ticket. by vice president harris and  governor walz top of the ticket. and the energy and joy they're  bringing to this campaign. i think we're in very good place as a party and they're going to  have a very good result in  november.  >> there is a lot of people that just want more blanks filled in  on exactly what type of policies and what type of administration  the vice president would have. it is almost as if we're  supposed to view the trump  administration as the incumbent. it is almost as if the incumbent isn't vice president harris and  president biden. should we look at this as a  continuation of the biden  administration? because i think -- i think on  the one hand you would like to  say, yeah, there has been some  successes, but on the other  hand, you probably don't want to own some of the things that --  where the approval rating is  underwater, whether it is  inflation or the border or  something like that. it is a fine line to walk, ron,  just to be perfectly blunt.  >> i agree with that. i think what you'll see the vice president do, what she's done is build on the successes, and take her own direction on some  things. and i think she's -- she  announced last week a plan to  cut taxes for middle class  families, with children,  especially big tax cut for  people with newborns. and, you know, that's something  that biden tried in 2021, got  passed for a single year,  couldn't get it passed after  that. she made that a top priority to  give middle class families tax  relief and to help small  businesses as well. and i think, you know, she's  also got reaching out to people, you heard her talk about not  just labor, but labor and  business, bringing people  together, i was very pleased to  see ken chenault speaking at our convention this week and i think she's building a broad coalition that includes people from both  parties, independents, business  people, working people, bringing the country together to tackle  our problems.  >> ron, the business network,  cnbc, watching the rhetoric and  there is populism infecting, i  think, both parties at this  point. they're all maybe chasing after  some of the same -- some of the  same voters. but the -- if there is a  difference between republicans  and democrats, it might be on  how they view the private  sector. and for every time i've heard  president biden, you know, say  look at how great our economy  is, we came out of the pandemic  faster, we're the best  positioned in the world, we've  created 15 million jobs. i mean, those are all private  sector accomplishments that we  saw. when we create jobs, that's, you know, i guess there is  government jobs too, but  hopefully there is more private  sector jobs than government jobs or we're doing the wrong thing. it just -- it seems to me a lot  of times i'm saying, wow, why  did they want to kill the goose  that is laying the golden egg. more regulations, higher taxes,  all -- price gouging, greedy  corporate, you know, fear -- all the rhetoric as well as a lot of the proposed policies seem to be antibusiness. why? >> i don't agree with that. look, i think most of the jobs  are private sector jobs. and the point is the goose laid  a lot of golden eggs under joe  biden and kamala harris. stock markets hit record highs,  equities are all time  valuations, and we had record  job growth. so, we have had strong private  sector growth. i think you're going to see --  you saw the vice president talk  about working with business more closely. as i said, we had ken chenault  speak at the convention this  time. she was our leader on small  business formation, and the  biden/harris administration we  had regard small business  formation the past three years. she's familiar with technology,  she is familiar with the role it plays in our competent. i think she's going to be a  president that is good for  working people, good for -- let  me be clear, she puts the middle class first, the thumb on the  scale for the middle class. i think that's -- i think that's good for our economy, not just  fair, good for our economy. the middle class does well,  everyone does well. her plan to raise taxes on the  wealthiest americans and cut  taxes for middle class working  americans is a fair plan to  redistribute the tax burden in a more fair way, to fund our  government to br<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> the books, in the rear view  mirror. vice president harris and former president trump are beginning  the sprint now to november. and the crypto industry is  flexing its financial might to  have a real impact on the  election and mackenzie joins us  now with more. good morning.  >> good morning, joe. so nearly half of all the  corporate money being pumped  into this year's election is  coming from the crypto industry. according to a new report from  the nonprofit watchdog group  public citizen. the sector which has been under  high scrutiny by the biden  administration is outspending  big oil and banks this cycle  with coke industries in a  distant second place in terms of corporate contributions. heavyweights like coinbase,  ripple and andreessen horowitz  have collectively given more  than $146 million with the goal  of trying to get candidates who  are friendly to the industry  into office. now, most of that corporate  money being raised is going to  the popular and bipartisan pro  crypto super pac called fair  shake, one of the top spending  pacs this year. i spoke to the team last night  to get the latest numbers on the four largest donors to fair  shake and its associated pacs. coyne base contributed $49  million, jump crypto put in $15  million. as for where all the money is  going, a filing with the federal election commission this week  showed in july fair shake  dispersed almost $75 million and still has nearly $120 million  left to deploy with 73 days to  go until the november election. super pac pledged $25 million  from that pool of cash to 18  house candidates in the general  election to be split among nine  democrats and nine republicans. it has committed another $18  million to three senate races,  joe. >> so we're in this sprint now,  ma condck mackenzie. yesterday we had 75 days. i think 74 qualifies. with 74 days, how many hours? 17 hours. >> what time do they consider  election day? >> 22 minutes and -- 6 seconds. i can't -- but that is a sprint  and i don't know what happens  now. do you? in terms of crypto or anything  else? i'd like to know a lot about  what heverybody is going to do. i'm joyous, because i have a  great job, kelly is here. i'm joyous every day. i have a great family. but i need to know something. i need to know about crypto. do we know is gensler going to  be treasury secretary. can you break that news here? >> that is shocking. what i can tell you is that last month i was in nashville, and  donald trump was headlining the  biggest bitcoin event of the  year when he was last in office, he called bitcoin a scam, he had a big about face, coincided with the tens of millions of dollars  pouring into the race from  crypto companies. and he said during that speech  he planned to oust gensler from  his post of chair were he to  take office. what is interesting here is the  fact that four companies are  dominating the spend. so fair shake, that package has  a $120 million war chest, there  are four companies accounting  for more than 93% of that cash. these are companies battling the s.e.c., ripple and coinbase have actively been in courtrooms  against gensler and so what  you're seeing here is it is not  necessarily that crypto is an  issue that is going to sway  voters in battleground states or districts, but they're opening  their purse strings and making  crypto a part of the  conversation by making  themselves impossible to ignore  when they spend this much money. >> you know this woman? >> do i know mac? tell them what -- where was that from chad that you brought me  that little --  >> i bring kelly gifts back from around the world because cnbc  has been kind to deploy me out  to africa, the middle east,  europe. >> mackenzie, you are impressive and a great resource. i don't know why you're not on  our show every day. are you -- dotcom or what <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Fed Chair Powell needs to separate the Fed from the stock market, says MetLife's Drew Matus<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> investors will hear from fed  chair jay powell when he gives  his update on the economy and on monetary policy from the jackson hole symposium. for more on that, let's bring in drew matis, head of the global  economic and market strategy  team at metlife investment  management. i always think of you more of a  fixed income guy, drew, but if  you're at like an insurance  company the global investment  vat gist should be really good  at fixed income because we know  what insurance companies need to do. people expect money.  >> yeah.  >> it has to be there, does it  not? >> it does, so most of my job is fixed income.  >> yeah.  >> and that's good.  >> economics andates allocation, that kind of thing.  >> we talk about jay pout. we shouldn't be talking about  stocks at all but we do. we can't help it, but it's  really about interest rates. i was thinking about something. you remember a month ago when we had the growth scare, and i  don't know what your comments  were at that time. what if that -- that revision  from the bls we had earlier this week? what if it had been the day  after that -- that jobs report  when we were all -- you know,  our hair was on fire? like this week was almost a  non-event for the bond market  and for the stock market because we're back to thinking soft  landing is -- is where we are.  >> yeah. i mean, this is part of the  problem that powell has to deal  with which is, first of all, the last payroll report wasn't  great, but it wasn't, you know,  horribly, horribly, horribly  bad, certainly didn't deserve  the market reaction that it got. you know, for people paying  attention, the labor market has  been weakening for a while, and  the very fact that we cared  about the revisions to payroll. i mean, that also tells you  something.  >> did we care? certain people that used it as a political cudgel cared about it, but real economists didn't seem  to care.  >> i think people were looking  for it. it didn't show up and people  were calling them about it, you  know. i had things to do. i'd rather go get a cup of  coffee.  >> it actually took some  pressure off the fed. they can cut now, although they  are not cutting 50 because it's  an emergency. they are cutting because the  labor market is not as tight as  we thought.  >> that's what powell has to  communicate. he has to get a grip on the idea that the fed will be able to cut hundreds of basis points simply  because we have an unemployment  rate that's gone above 4%. you know, part of the problem is they keep talking about, you  know, oh, well, financial  conditions have eased. financial conditions have  loosened. they get into the circular  argument, right, so it's like  oh, we disappointed so financial conditions ease and because they ease we can do this. but really what they are really  just talking about is the stock  market did this and we have to  do that. what he really needs is separate the fed from the stock market  and really just kind of say,  hey, look. we've kind of -- we think we're  winning the war on inflation. the unemployment rate is going  to continue to move higher in  coming months, and that will put downward pressure on inflation  so we've got this. now we're just trying to get the plane on the ground, right,  and -- and so he needs to  articulate why a few rate cuts  are going to do that and get  people to kind of dial back this idea that they are going  hundreds of basis points over  the next six months.  >> yeah. the -- you know, the range of  what a -- when a plane lands, i  mean, from -- it's just a bad  analogy. i wish we had a different one to use because it just makes me  nervous. are we talking about at this  point -- when you're on a plane  and the guy is really good,  sometimes you don't even theme  the wheels touch down. other times you're like whoa,  i'm glald we std we stopped and  brakes on. what is it going to be like,  wow, i didn't feel that or it's  bumpy or worst case you go off  the runway. who knows.  >> i don't think it will be  particularly smooth. it will be somewhat bumpy in  part because of the vimt we're  seeing in markets. it's the fixation that has  everyone kind of<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Axios' Hans Nichols: Most interesting thing about Harris' speech was how forward looking it was<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> vice president kamala harris  accepted her party's nomination  for president and gave her  message to voters on the last  night of the dnc. joining us now is hans nichols,  axios political reporter. good morning to you. anything in particular stand  out? what do you think is kind of the implications, lasting  reverberation, we're looking at  poly market again trying to get  a sense of things. what would you say? >> to me the most interesting is how forward looking the harris  speech was, indeed the entire  week. they gave the day to joe biden  the first day and that had a  little bit of backward rooking,  but for the most part the  democratic party is trying to  cast to the future and cast this in the future tents and that's  what they want to make the  argument about. the interesting thing both the  trump and harris campaign  basically agree on a  fundamental, and that is that  the incumbent will lose, and  this has turned the entire  campaign into a battle on who is going to be the incumbent and  we're going to have sort of  dueling versions of that for  this 84, 80-day sprint.  >> i think that's probably true, although it does feel like  there's -- there is no  incumbent. i mean, she's done a lot to  create that distance between  herself and biden, although then again maybe not on policy front  and maybe for a lot of people  that's the most important thing. it's a reminder of the things  like the tax on capital gains  that biden might have thrown out there in recent years and more  glossed over and now they are  coming back from the supposedly  dead.  >> yeah. well, they were glossed over in  large part because when those  proposals, when biden threw out  the proposals the senate was  either controlled by republicans or effectively controlled. you had a backstop of manchin or sinema. people should be very humbled by their ability to predict and the conventional wisdom is the  republicans will win back the  senate, but if they don't and  the democrats take the house,  they are going to have the blank slate to really entirely  re-engineer the tax structure in this country. it's going to be an open bazaar. there's going to be a huge  revenue need. they obviously want to do  stuff -- raise taxes on the  corporate side and individual  side for wealthier americans. yes, when biden maybe the  proposals, you know, the initial build back better proposal in  april of 2021 to pay for a $3  trillion proposal, it was given  short shrift in part because the senate was controlled by  republicans. we don't know who is going to  control the senate.  >> right. >> i think there's probably  going to be more scrutiny on  that and certainly what the  trump campaign wants to talk  about but don't look to the  harris campaign for a lot of  sp  specifics here in the coming  months.  >> one thing we've been  pondering wondering about the  debt and deficit situation, very much a republican talking point, you know, that that situation  needs to be addressed so when  you hear things like the  corporate tax rate going higher  and how much revenue that would  raise. on some level if you want to  raise the corporate tax rate you can do so whether it has a  budgetary impact or not. it's weird. i almost wonder if the right  should stop trying to say, you  know, that you need to do x, y  or z to balance the budget and  simply debate the issue on the  merits. what should be the corporate tax might be? what's better at generating  revenue and the same could go  for any of the tax policies? >> vess a very fair point. the problem is what generates  the most revenue and where you  want to be on the laffer curve,  if you raise the rate it's going to increase actual revenues. both sides look for advantageous scores. so, i mean, it's a fair question of what should the optimal tax  rate be. it just gets polluted, you know, with legitimate ideological  concerns about where that number should be.  >> yeah.  >> it's not just about -- it's  not just about the laffer curve, it's about how companies expand  domestically or whether they  expand internationally, and --  and there is a number where they are not going to -- not going to build here. maybe it's not where it is right now, 21. maybe they will be able to build here at 25, but there is a  number, and i mentioned joe wolk a lot, built an $8 billion  facility that would not have  been built here, maybe it would  have been at 25, but, you know,  hans, i've off -- i want zero. fur want to tax -- it's de  minimus, discretionary, you  know. it's 7% of what you raise of  total revenues, right? >> yeah.  >> it's not going to solve  anything increasing taxes on  corporations. it's just a fairness issue.  >> yeah. right, but eventually you get -- i mean 7% here, you know, the  old washington joke, a trillion  here, a trillion there, pretty  soon you're talking about real  money. i take your point.  >> and unless there's spending  and then it's not real money.  >> if you want to have the  spending conversation which no  one ever talks about. let's leave the sort of revenue  side off of the equation. very few people talked about the mandatory non-discretionary  spending that's like 70% of the  budget.  >> totally.  >> that's right.  >> that's the elephant in the  room.  >> and trump has taken that off  the books.  >> what if the market has taken  that off the books v.any of us  seen -- you could argue maybe  long-term rates are higher right now because of the situation,  but it's an argument and it's  unclear if that's the case. that's why i'm saying what if  the right is no, you don't have  to raise the corporate tax rate  to generate revenues. you don't.  >> yeah. it's like -- you hear that in  pockets. i mean, to joe's -- that you  don't actually need to have  higher rates for the revenue  side. trump -- when we had the big  debate in 2017 it wasn't  preordained the number would go  to 21% on the corporate tax  rate. the business community said  we're fine with 25 and trump is  like i want to bring it to 21  and i want to say the business  roundtable, actually we meant  21. so, you know, 25 doesn't seem  like the business community will cry uncle on that, so -- but to  joe's point, backing up  calculation i use for every  percentage point. it's about 100 billion/10 so  that's how much you get in  revenue. again, like eventually bond  markets, eventually the markets  in general are going to wonder  how much money we're spending  and how much we're raising, and  you can't have these -- these  annual fiscal deficits out that  long. i hate to say this, and  everyone -- we're all tired  because we went through a  convention but in january we'll  have a debt ceiling conversation again and that doesn't go away,  and that's not fun. there are stories you like  reporting about in washington. debt ceiling i can confidently  say it's not one of mine.  >> what are though going to do  democratic through and through  on the deficit? do they have to do anything? >> they have to raise it, yeah. >> raise it.  >> and we'll have extraordinary  measures and then -- it's easier to do it if <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Smialek: When we hit these turning points in the Economy, the labor market is the first thing to go.<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> there at the jackson hole  summit. good morning. always good to see are you? good morning. thanks for having me.  >> let's start off. what are you expecting? big week for the markets. we have a lot of stuff going on  obviously today, and a big day  for economic reports. g dp next week and pce. how much do you expect chair  powell to give us guidance on  what he's thinking for the  september meeting? >> yeah. i think the big challenge for  jay powell is there's a very  important jobs report coming on  september 6 which will give the  fed officials a real clear  leading on whether the pop-up in unemployment we saw in july that has them worried was a real  thing or a one-time one-off  situation that isn't going to  repeat itself, so i think that  that is just a critical piece of data. it's almost hard to exaggerate  how big of a deal that is, and  that means it's going to be very difficult for powell to really  commit very firmly to anything  today. i think he's clearly going to -- it's always a big speech and  always a big theme-setting  speech that he gives out here,  but i think he wants to avoid  saying we're definitely going 25 or we've definitely going 50 in  september, and i think that that is probably where we are. it's going to be a good speech  but not a firmly committing one. >> sounds like you're saying our expectations may be just a bit  too high. some are waiting to hear what  he's saying to look for any  clues. the jobs market isn't quite as  strong as many of us thought it  was. we saw the downward revision of  over 800,000 jobs lower. that is backward looking but is  that an important data point for them as they look to future  decisions? >> yeah, i think it's probably  rell rant so them, and i think  it's relevant in the context of  some of the other data we've  gotten recently. we now know the jobs market  wasn't kicking as strongly as it was earlier in the year and we  know the unemployment rate seems to be moving up. if you look at the new york fed  survey which just surveyed it's  not a long dated one but it  shows that household are  reporting that their job  prospects are souring pretty  seriously. i think you take all that have  together, and it definitely  looks like a molt where you need to be cautious about the outlook for the job market, and that  matters a lot because i think  it's often, you know, sort of  forgotten or overlooked that  when we hit these turning points in the economy, the labor market is often the first thing to go. like it's consistently the case  that you have unemployment move  up and the job markets slow down before you see retail slow,  before you see the gdp and other sort of consumption-based  metrics really start to take a  crack, so i think they have got  to pay a lot of attention to  this stuff you. >> mentioned the jobs report  coming up. again, we have pce next week and another cpi report. how important are those as the  fed looks to make that september decision? >> i think they are probably  important as confirming  evidence, but i think that the  reality is that at this point  the fed is seeing basically what it wants to see when it comes to inflation. you know, i don't think that the bar is super high here. i think they need to see a  continuation of what they have  already been seeing. they need things to not sort of  go crazy or break out the  pattern that it's been recently, but in general like what the  picture that they are looking at is one of inflation that is  pretty steadily coming down of  the things that are still  holding inflation up, the pretty quirky things, the housing  indicators that we love to talk  about which are very lacking so  at this point they are feeling  pretty good about inflation so  it's just a matter of clearing  that hurdle of continuing to be  the kind of progress that we've  been seeing. >> you know, previous weeks  we've seen the markets kind of  move when different fed  officials come out and speak and here we'll hear from jay powell  and hear what he has to say and  later in the day we'll hear from aust ann goolsbee. steve liesman has this and next  week we'll hear from raffaele  bostic. how much weight should we put on the view of each of these fed  officials as we go towards the  that september meeting? >> you know, i think chair  powell is the most important  person in that room and his  speech will set the agenda and  dominate. big moments like this where  you've got sort of a turning  point and there's a difficult  decision to make and it could be a close decision, you know, i  think that it's entirely  possible that the fed doesn't  really knoll if they will go 25  basis points or 50 basis points  in september. at that moment this can really  matter because i think it can be the case that they kind of have  to make sure that everybody is  on board in order to get a move  through and so i think, that you know, particularly if some of <br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Cava CEO Brett Schulman on Q2 results, pricing strategies and growth outlook<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> casual train cava moving sharply higher this morning. the company raised its full year outlook ter the second quarter results beat analysts estimates. the stock now up more than 400%  since its ipo in june of 2023. joining us now is cava ceo brett schulman. we're getting all the  background.  >> fascinating.  >> it is, because i can't  believe it has been five  quarters already that you've  been able to report since  cava -- and i can't believe the  stock performance. though, as i said, i've eaten  there and i do believe the stock performance. i really liked it. i've only been there once. but the fifth quarter you said  you would characterize it as  maybe the best quarter you've  had.  >> yeah. the 9.5% traffic growth is just  a great performance and a test  amount to  ament to our mediterranean  restaurants. >> you were one of the  co-founders in the original  cava, we just found out. it is still around. it is cava mese in rockville,  maryland.  >> all my co-founders are sons  of greek immigrants and the  brand's origins go back to 2006. and then they started selling  dips and spreads, feta, harissa, and a couple of local whole  foods. i was introduced to my  co-founders to a friend from  college, cousin is one of my  co-founders and they asked me to join up fourth partner and we  took elements of both of those  businesses the full service  restaurant and our grocery  products and put it in a fast  health-based format to really  unleash the pourb ower of this   to the world.  >> can we talk about how you're  pricing things? have you -- we got price gouging legislation around, have you  raised prices more than your  costs have increased? >> i think that's been one of  the things that has really  helped us drive our success and  drive our traffic. if you think about from the end  of 19 to the end of '23, we only raised prices about 12% during  that time period. cpi went up 18%. the department of labor has  noted that fast food has raised  prices upward of 30%. it enhanced our relative value  proposition and able to deliver  a really compelling value to our guests which is clearly  resonating and even recently in  california with the legislation  801228, we were the only limited service brand that didn't take  incremental price as a result of some of the legislative wage  increases.  >> are you taking losses,  though, or taking margin hits? because you know you're growing  so fast, you can deal with it  down the road, you can take some share from other players because profitability is not the main  focus right now? >> that's the power of our  economic model. our two year restaurant sales  growth is up, that allowed us to invest in our team members. we invested wages 9% year over  year, mitigate cost increases to our guests and expand restaurant level margin at the same time.  >> i can't -- so, i don't know,  that was the question i had, i  don't know how you can raise  prices less than what your costs were increasing.  >> i think it is how we built  this business from the very  beginning. we have vertically integrated  production capability, we have  two manufacturing facilities  where we make our fresh dips and spreads that tziki and we're  making it in 9,000 pound batches and that allows us to take the  complexity out of the four walls of our restaurants and bring you that fresh product at scale  consistently with quality and  cost effectiveness. we source over 85% of our  ingredients directly from our  grower rancher partners and we  invested in wages. even back in 2016, we took our  national starting wage to $13 an hour when many were paying 9 and 10 and $11 an hour. and that equals a great service, great experience, and that's  translated into great growth  which obviously we get lefveragd on our other costs. >> how much have you looked to  something like a chipotle as a  template for what you can  achieve? it is not as if you came from  having launched already a  successful fast casual chain  yourself. this is -- it is hard to get it  right the first time. what is the blueprint, what is  the game plan and many, many  people there is all these memes  going around where people are  saying, you're basically -- your market cap is $37 million per  cava location now. even chipotle is 21. the market is assigning a huge  premium to what you're doing. what does the growth blueprint  look like? >> i think it is a testament to  the belief in our massive wide  space opportunity and we're  creating and defining the next  large scale cultural cuisine  category, mediterranean. that unique quicuisine where yo  don't have to sacrifice flavor  for your health. our growth plan is 1,000  restaurants by 2032. 15% plus --  >> three times as many as you  have now but a third of what  chipotle has.  >> we're small in that regard. restaurants do not scale like  sass software. it takes a lot of process and  infrastructure that we invested  in heavily over the years to be  able to scale like we're growing today. >> what does it mean for where  you end up? you end up -- where are you not  right now and what are the  plans, how many do you add per  year and that must be hard to  do.  >> yeah, that's the other great  thing about this wide space  opportunity. we operate in 25 states.  >> 25.  >> and the district of columbia  today. we opened our first locations in the upper midwest in chicago. so, we have -- those are our  only locations in the upper  midwest. not in the pacific northwest,  northern california. plus we think we have tremendous depth and breadth of expansion  in the 25 states we operate in  today.  >> you're not going to 50? >> some day we aspire to be in  all 50 states.  >> how many you're averaging new ones per year? >> this year we raised our  guidance from -- to 54 to 57 new locations this year. and then we have kind of  committed to 15% plus growth  rate from here on out.  >> inf<br>

<strong>Transcript:</strong> joining me now is dan ives,  managing director of web bush. eps growth of 125%, investments  um, astronomical. you're shaking your head and can this company meet expectations  and can it exceed them or is  meeting them good enough for  investors? >> meeting is not good enough  but i believe this is going to  be a drop the mic moment because it shows all the streaks are  accelerating. every quarter they say prove, it prove it, prove it. this revolution is just starting and it all starts with nvidia. in my opinion it's the most  important earnings not just the  year but potentially many years  in terms of what this represents in terms of tech.  >> i've been asking a lot of  people this. is it the earnings that matter  or the guidance because the oaks pectations are lofting? they say they meet or beat when  it comes to revenue and eps but  the guidance isn't what people  are expecting. what does it do to the stock and the markets? >> it's all about the guidance. we just got back from asia. all of our checks is showing  that the street is still  underestimating this  acceleration because right now  the only game in town is jensen, and really if you look at what  invidya is doing, especially  from chips coming forward, this  enterprise the man is just  starting. in my opinion powell in jackson  hole is so important.  >> huge.  >> but the market, what it's  going to do for the rest of the  year, and i could argue even  into 2025, it starts with this  nvidia earnings. i expect, get the popcorn ready. >> you say this every quarter,  dan.  >> but this -- this is going to  be a show-shopper's showing  where the revolution is going,  and i think the skeptics can  continue to be proven wrong.  >> what about the questions, the air pocket between different  iterations of their chips, some  of their customers making their  own chips and the fact that the  a.i. enthusiasm seems to be  dying down? you're not concerned about any  of that? >> yeah. so it's hit on them. delayed for two or three months, i view that as sort of an  asterix. in other words, this is not  moving the needle in terms of a  demand perspective. when you talk about a.i. in  terms of some of the hype, look  what we saw from the  hyperscalers, amazon, google,  microsoft, this in terms of the  use chases. know is showers the second and  third and fourth derivatives are starting to play out. when i look at what the  godfather of a.i. and nvidia are doing. we're talking about  transformation. i believe a year from now this  is a $4 trillion market cap  along with apple and microsoft.  >> you're saying jensen nvidia,  not jenson wong anymore. you're making decisions. i want to get back to the note. according to your research for  every dollar spent on nvidia  chips it flows through from the  rest of the tech sector from $8  to $10. what does that mean for some of  the other stocks? >> that's the most important  thing. remember, it's not just bin  vidya. it's about the multiplier. it's about the revolution, the  drill done dollars of cap "x." for every dollar spent on an  nvidia chip, there's an eight to ten multiplier across the rest  of the tech. that's why it's so important for what nvidia says for this bull  market to continue.  >> you're saying it's a broad  tailwind, a rising tide that  lifts all boats, even in  software because soft weigh  seems to be under pressure, or  at least it was and it seems  like the money going to software is going to dhips.  >> you'll hear from benioff and  salazar, what are they focused  on? a.i. look at mcdermott, it just  started now. the software wave is a second  derivative. nasdaq 20,000 next year and it  continues because now the rest  of this party -- it is only 9:00 p.m. in the a.i. party.  >> that goes to when? >> and we believe it goes to  4:00 a.m.  >> not to sunrise.  >> 4:00 a.m. will there be time the mousse  being stops, yeah, but right now next week it shows this party  and the music continues to play  on.  >> i know tech is a warehouse. we'll show a chart. this is the mag 7 and equal  weight which outperformed the  mag 7. when it comes to the mag 7  trade, how does that compare? post-earnings up or down 10%? what do you think it does the  mega cap/a.i. trade? >> i think this is just a start. look what happens in terms of  the new iphone launched. the a.i. story will be led --  >> this is the broadening of the market. people are putting money in  other places, especially  cyclicals ahead of cuts. you're saying this report could  actually change some of the  flows? >> i think it do, and i think  ultimately tech will lead the  market higher from a large cap  perspective. we look into year end and i  think mag seven outperforms. look, many have been -- the bear is in hibernation mode. they have been negative on big  tech for the last few years, but when it comes down<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Gibbs: European companies are much more stable, and can give you some nice upside<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> good morning. great to hear from you i should  say.  >> yeah. great to hear from you, frank  >> i think we need to start off  with jay powell speaking later  today. what are your expectations for  what he's going to say? also the market reaction? >> sure. i think we're going to hear much of what we've seen before. i'm not sure we're going to get  any big surprises. i think the biggest jackson  whole surprise we've seen this  year is going to be a little  less because they are a little  unsure after that july  unemployment report, and so i  think they are going to be a  little more cautious perhaps  saying that they are going to do a cut okay, you know, making it  more likely for september, but  certainly not giving us any  indication about the magnitude  of the cut because i think just  like your prior guest said,  we're really looking at that  august job report that comes out the beginning of september. i think that's going to be the  last critical point and  information that they are going  to be looking at before they  give us any real indication.  >> you know, erin, you're  focusing a lot on jobs right  now. i want to get your take on the  downward revision of jobs, over  800,000 that we saw. what was your reaction to that? how do you think the fed is  reading that? >> for me i think it was  something that people were  complaining and feeling. it really reaffirmed what people had been saying all along and  while people are dismissing it  and saying the fed may not look  at it, i disagree on that point. think it is something that we  look at because when we got that initial shock of the jobs report for july, there was a lot of  dismissiveness and oh, it's just because of immigration, and they sort of poo-pooed it, and that's why we saw the markets drop and  rebounded immediately, so i  think that this is just another  crack that we're seeing. this causes a lot of concern for me, you know. how are we going to unwind all  of the stimulus and are we  already too late when it comes  to creating negative  unemployment or slowing  unemployment? >> one more big question for  you. >> sure.  >> we've been talking about this earlier in the show. big week for the economy. jay powell this week and nvidia  next week. a big take on how you see nvidia earnings playing out. we were talking about eps growth forecasted to be 120% higher. >> look, i think nvidia has a  great track record of being able to beat the earnings. i think they will do well. i'm not sure they are going to  be able to brave the remainder  of the a.i. sector and nvidia is its own entity and being able to navigate the space.  >> last but not least, give us  your record of the day.  >> it's euroreversal, unwinding  the cautionary fear that we're  looking at if we do get poor  unemployment so i'm liking at  stable european companies that  can do well that are low  valuation, low risk and won't  have as much of a turnaround if  we see some disappointing  reports come out and see the  volatility that we saw in  october. they are still favorable and  will give you nice upside.  >> all eyes on the u.s.,  specifically wyoming. you're looking over in europe. the idea is we're going to get  rate cuts, possibly a quarter,  maybe even 50 basis points. isn't that the time to put money in the u.s. market? why would you want to leave the  u.s. as we go into a rate cut? >> well, because the a ecb  already cut rates back in june  so, look, they are looking to  stimulate. it's not so much that i'm saying that europe is going to uth  perform america. i'm saying the american markets  are extraordinarily frothy, you  know. we've gotten back up to the high valuations, and we have a lot of risk if we don't p<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Mohtashami: Rates are still a little bit too high for the existing homes sales to grow.<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> let's bring in the lead analyst  from logue housing wire. great to see you. >> good to be here.  >> a year ago rates were almost  a percent higher. does that have a real impact,  6.5%, and if so does it have a  bigger impact on existing or new home sales? >> i believe it will have more  of an impact on new home sales  because the builders can still  pay down rates. i haven't seen anything to have  sustained growth in the existing home sales market until we get  rates below 6% and having it  stay there, but the builders  have shown that they can grow  sales since the low is of 2022  because they live in a sub 6%  mortgage market. we've got a little small bounce  recently in the existing home  sales market. purchase application has picked  up just a tad, but nothing to  get too excited. rates are still a little bit too high for the existing home sales to grow.  >> seems like people really  aren't getting excited. i was on the housing wire site. backwards looking. it shows mortgage applications  town 10% ending on august 16. why is that? why are the applications down  with rates down so significantly from just a year ago in  >> you know. i would like to compare this  period to the early 1980s when  affordableability was a little  bit worse back then, but  mortgage rates wind 2.5% lower  and stayed there. so for us to get sustained  growth, you know. mortgage rates probably have to  be between 4% and 6% for a while and then since home sales are  really at record lows we can  grow sales from there. now the builders have shown us  that you can grow sales in a sub 6% mortgage market. the existing home sales isn't  there. they don't have that ability to  push rates lower like the  builders can.  >> logan, of course, we were  coming off the last night of the dnc. kamala harris speaking last  night. something that has made  headlines. a lot of people are talking  about her plan for the $25,000  assistance when it comes to  housing. i want to get your take on it. in your view does that have the  potential at least to have a  meaningful impact on the housing market, especially for newer  buyers and younger buyers? >> you know the 2010 tax cut  boosted home sales very briefly. it brought forward-looking  demand in. it does have the potential to  grow sales if mortgage rates  keep on growing lower. both those two things together  can grow sales. i do believe again the builders  will probably benefit more with  that plan, and if you really  want housing starts to grow,  you'll need more new home sales, and that will assist with lower  mortgage rates to boost sales up definitely for sure considering  how low existing home sales are  today. >> want to come full circle. we'll hear from jay powell later today speaking in jackson hole. what he says, does that actually influence the mortgage market? we talk a lot about rates and  mortgages? how actually are they actually  correlated or tied? >> well, you know, we've had a  1.5% move from the highs of last year. i think the mortgage market is  really working off the labor  market. if the labor market gets softer, definitely rates can go lower. what rate cuts can do is make  the mortgage spreads better. we're about 75 basis points or  1% higher than what we would  normally see mortgage rates. rate cuts and a mo<br>

<div><strong>Title:</strong> Haefele: with the cash rate coming down, now is a great time to move towards a balanced portfolio<br>
<strong>Transcript:</strong> executive officer at ubs global  wealth management. good morning. it's been a while. good to see you.  >> great to see you.  >> you put out your monthly  letter just yesterday, i  believe. in there you're expecting to see rate cuts and for investors it's time to put some cash to work if you have your cash on the  shrine. how do they do it, and what  would you suggest? >> yeah. well, i think one of the  important things for people to  realize is with the cash rates  coming down, now is a great time to move which think towards a  balanced portfolio. we see opportunities in  investment grade, but also in  stocks here, you know. i think we're in august. we have the u.s. election but  typically when the fed is  cutting rates, starts cutting  rates and you're not in a  recession, that is very good for stocks over the next year.  >> by the way in your note you  actually have some data on a  balanced perle, 60/40 is a  traditional one, 60 tox and 40  treasuries. always positive and other stats. don't have touch time to get  into that right now. let's take a look at the dollar. the dollar is falling about 3%,  and in your mind you say that's  something very important for  investors but why? isn't a falling dollar good for  u.s. stock investors? >> yeah. it can be good for investors. i think, you know, one of the  factors is if the dollar is  coming down. we're looking at some of the  other currencies around the  world that might be strong, and  then it also gives us an  opportunity to hedge some of the political risks that may be  coming up with things like the  swiss franc and gold that can be stronger.  >> you think gold could be  stronger. another interesting data point  in your monthly note you is  changed your outlook when it  comes to the election. right nowy see a 40% chance of  harris winning with a divided  congress, a 10% chance of trump  winning with a divided congress  and you say investors may be too focused on the election but i do think we have to pay attention  especially a day after the dnc  ends. with this data in mind, is there something thatshippers should  do, to hedge or prepare for this outcome that you're now seeing? >> well, you know, if the summer taught us anything, i think it's the old thing vote at the ballot box, not with your portfolio  given the switcheroo that we  had. given the time we have it takes  betting on the election off the  table. the most important thing that we see in our forecast and, of  course, how big it reflects  reality is that the likeliest <br>
