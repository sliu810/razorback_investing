weather here i hope you all had a chance to enjoy it if it was nice by you as well going to jump right into the questions from earl what month do you think the fed will pivot august i've been saying by the end of 3q 22 at the latest uh what has happened in credit markets over the last couple weeks has brought that forward for me so that's that's what i think at this point uh from david recession seems guaranteed when the fed pivots can more qe levitate stocks in such a recession i agree that i think the recession is now fair to complete and and yes i do think that more qe will send stocks higher from pa what if the fed is willing to punish the u.s economy in order to save the dollar is there no way they could slow walk the tightening while a new administration basically cuts government spending in my opinion it's sort of what they're doing what the whole point of this uh tightening uh really is i think when you when you talk about fighting inflation you're really talking about defending the dollar um so i think they're i think they're doing that but in my opinion they're not willing and they will never be willing to punish washington dc they'll punish the regular america they'll punish the economy but they won't take it so far as to punish washington dc and by by that i mean if we have a stronger dollar from tightening and a recession you're going to have a shortfall of foreign buyers of treasuries you're already starting to see this in the data article out today japan selling treasuries due to where the dollar is due to the after fx hedge uh yield on u.s treasuries relative to other sovereign debt out there uh and so if you have a shortfall foreign buying a treasuries you either have to do one of three things you either have to cut spending in a recession uh at the federal level and with federal government 22 percent of gdp that's going to make the recession a lot worse the deficits a lot higher non-linearly or you're going to see yields on treasuries up in a recession which is highly unusual and again will worsen the recession given the interest rate sensitivity of tax receipts the u.s economy more broadly or the fed buys it with qe and the first two options really amount to the fed standing aside as a debt death spiral effectively with u.s debt to gdp us deficits to gdp this high where you're just gonna have higher interest rates higher dollar lower tax receipts bigger deficits higher interest rates higher dollar washers repeat until either the system collapses or the fed does what they did in april uh march and april 2020 uh which is going to uh expand their balance sheet much faster from mark g luke your premise that the us deficit will rise materially is predicated on much higher interest rates much higher interest expense but with higher rates it will take but higher rates will take quite some time to reflect in higher interest expense even with lower receipts the treasury could the treasury not run a medium-term deficit and the fed not need to pivot the rates are really a small part of it directly speaking historically the dynamic is really that historically in recessions last four recessions we have seen deficits as a percent of gdp rise by one thousand percent of uh excuse me one thousand basis points of gdp and the covet which we'll set aside 800 basis points of gdp and 08 500 basis points of gdp and o1 and 300 basis points of gdp going back to 91. so we've i've not been using the coven thousand basis points of gdp deficit increase although it may be apropos given how high debt levels are across the economy and around the world uh but what we're saying is basically let's just use the middle case of 500 basis points of gdp within the first year of a recession in terms of widening out the deficit as receipts come in sharply lower and uh counter cyclical payments rise with unemployment so 500 base points of gdp that's about a 1.1 trillion dollar increase in treasury issuance at a time where the fed's still theoretically selling treasuries uh the treasury's still selling treasuries to the tune of a trillion too right so the deficit would go to uh one 2.3 trillion fed selling treasuries foreigners are selling treasuries um who the we're talking about the the the effective supply of treasuries going to three or four trillion dollars it's unclear to me uh in a global economy of 80 trillion in gdp growing three percent in a non-recession that's 2.4 trillion of gdp growth against three to four trillion of net treasury issuance effective treasury issuance um who the buyer is at current rates uh and that's assuming global gdp is still growing you start shrinking global gdp that number gets even more backwards you get the stronger dollar flight to safety less foreign buying these are the dynamics where there's just this fundamental supply demand problem for treasuries that has never existed before debt wasn't this high deficits weren't this high dollar not as much offshore dollar debt that required people to sell treasuries to service dollar debt uh there's all these factories that factors that have never happened before and so that's really the dynamic now could the treasury the treasury i think has five or six hundred billion dollars in the treasury general account or tga could they run that down um to buy themselves a few months so they don't have to increase issuance i think they can i think the market will start to see through that pretty quickly because obviously it's only a finite amount of money in there and they don't like to usually drain it below certain levels but they could uh in the short run so that maybe is something that could push out the pivot date where i would be wrong from tf what should ordinary people without a ton of money be doing to prepare themselves to best weather this storm i think you want to be liquid i think you want to be unlevered as much as possible and i think you want to be balanced what we're going through this this first bursting global sovereign debt bubble in 100 plus years centered in the west for the first time in a hundred plus years uh with peak cheap energy peak cheap commodities for the first time ever uh this is the most frightening macro setup i've seen in my career doing this 27 years so it's it is it is not the time to be being brash and being hyper aggressive um i think the where we're getting to quickly is is is like the end game i think is is is pretty crystal clear i think is highly likely which is face peeling printing probably through some version of yield curve control it's already restarted in japan they're moving a little towards it right now we're talking about it in europe i think it's going to come to america as well that's something that's good for gold it's good for bitcoin it's good for commodities equities however it's critical uh as as as as a quote unquote ordinary person in these markets to understand that this is a political event this is a political process so between here and that endgame we're already seeing the mind-boggling volatility uh that that that that has happened and i will likely continue to happen it's a highly political process of what is effectively sovereign default in the west likely to be done via sustained high inflation but again that doesn't mean we can't go through six months in time like we've just had where we're seeing risk off in bonds and stocks in a way that has not happened in at least 50 years i expect these types of oh this hasn't happened in at least 50 years events to become increasingly common and when we talk about balance so you want to be unlevered you want to be borrowing a bunch of money and buying a bunch of of assets you want to be conservatively financed i think you want to maintain a higher than usual liquidity position so more cash than usual when i talk about balance i always go back in my mind to the jacob fugger the the richest man in history as a percent of global gdp supposedly and how he generated and passed down generational wealth with a very simple model 25 cash 25 gold 25 stocks 25 real estate rebalance when one gets out of whack with the others if you want to inject a little bit coin on the gold part if you want to inject a little bit of bonds with the stocks part or some commodities with the stocks uh part go for it i think there's different things you can do in real estate but that's what i mean about balance that that is balance so uh from dale why did oil drop so severely last week that's a good question that was what i was asking myself and other relationships in the business over the weekend the short answer is i don't know there were rumors of peace talks there were potentially the biden export bans some concerns about the impacts of that the fuel export bans that the biden administration is now talking about essentially out of political desperation uh demand fears as maybe the economy is slowing down although the the highway data the fuel usage data in the us at least don't seem to be supporting that at least yet just extreme positioning it doesn't take a whole lot if everybody's really bullish on energy and i know we are um it doesn't take a lot to get it to sell off a little bit in the other direction so i i don't really know those are some of the thoughts that i had heard over the weekend as possible explanations but i don't have a great explanation for you so i apologize uh from jeff here's my question if you were right but the fed is either in denial or doesn't get it yet what will break as they get it wrong or perhaps more concise how long can the fed keep pushing rates out before they're forced to relent what are endpoint conditions uh the stuff that'll break is the stuff that's already breaking uh bitcoin first stocks bonds mortgages treasuries high yield um and really it's stocks high yield mortgages um foreign sovereign treasury market uh housing you're starting inventories build tax receipts which are starting to get weak uh in may although it's a noisy data series everything we're seeing is what i'd expect to see breaking if they're starting to make a policy mistake on the downside so i think they really want to see oil and gas break i think they've effectively been co-opted into the geopolitical fight against putin and russia i just don't think they're going to be able to get oil and gas down a whole lot without doing critical damage to the u.s and western economies more broadly multiple questions about powell's comment last late last week that rapid changes in the global monetary system may affect future international roll of the u.s dollar then what my thoughts were around that here's another one i don't know it's a very odd thing for the federal reserve chairman to say i'm not sure if it was just a boilerplate warning type of legalese uh or if he's hearing something or or being debriefed on something i mean i russia could certainly do something in retaliation that would have have that effective impact right they could shut off the gas taps to europe they could say that's it we're only taking gold for our gas we're only taking bitcoin bitcoin for our oil in theory um saudi could do something similar hey we're now pricing oil in yuan uh and settling effectively uh at least some of it in gold that i i think a saudi announcement about yuan a russian announcement about gold uh would probably fit into the rapid changes in the global monetary system but until i see something else i i just have to believe it's probably just boilerplate i don't know the context of the question and then finally two questions that were sort of related could you explain why ten-year bond yields rising to three to four percent is bad and will force the fed to turn if a few years ago they were much higher italy and germany 10-year yields were doubled just 10 years ago why will rising yields force the ecb to turn two and luke could you please talk about the mounting sovereign debt crisis that now appears to be understood more broadly what you believe the awareness acknowledgement and response of the fed may be in coming weeks so i i think a key difference here is inflation's finally here right inflation's here and and and that is problem one and then secondly the debt levels in the west are much higher post covered and and so the issue is the amount of rate hikes needed to stop the inflation is likely to bankrupt the sovereigns because the debt's so high and so i i think i i agree there is greater awareness i still think it's in the minority it's not mainstream yet there's still a lot of mainstream policy makers out there that think the us can pull up a volcker a paul volcker to fight inflation but i do think an an aha moment uh is coming in the next couple months when u.s and global economic data i think have a chance of getting bad enough where inflation's not coming down that fast uh that suddenly there's this recognition that they can't type much more um and that i think that is a i think that will be reinforced by i think the u.s treasury's seeing tax receipts come in below expectations for several months in a row where they have to come out and say well we weren't going to issue much in the second or third quarter but now we've got to increase treasury issuance because tax receipts are coming in below expectations and if you increase treasury issuance into what we're already seeing is this uh sub-optimal u.s treasury supply demand dynamic which is part of the reason why yields are rising that may also really be an aha moment or a forcing factor where uh the treasury market sovereign debt markets more broadly get dysfunctional again you argue arguably we're already seeing that a bit in japan and europe in the last couple of weeks it's strange credulity i think if we're already seeing japan and europe that the fed won't be forced to follow so i think we're seeing a lot of the signposts of a breakdown or an acceleration in the in the global sovereign debt bubble bursting um and that's part of the reason why i think the fed's going to be forced to pivot by the end of 3q 22 at the latest probably earlier so with that i'm going to finish up for today i want to thank everybody for joining me as always uh if you're interested in what we're up to you can check us out at fftt-llc.com learn more about our different product offerings both institutional mass market learn more about tree rings which is quick 10 most interesting things uh summary about uh each each point and why it grabbed our attention

actually my oldest son's birthday as well so had a lot of fun uh so let me with that preamble jump right into it first question comes from david can you give a two-minute articulation of your electro electric vehicle slash peak cheap oil hypothesis uh yeah i think it's it's pretty straightforward so for cheap oil i think is a key way to phrase it and and really the case is the biggest incremental increase in oil supply since 2005 678 pick your date uh has been from u.s shale globally and u.s shale producers over the last five six seven years have increasingly high graded their wells which means they've produced their most attractive acreage to maximize cash flows particularly during the 2014 to 2016 downturn and now having high graded a lot of their best acreage uh they are now having a harder time overcoming depletion rates that have always been around three to five percent per month in that industry depending on uh the prior two years worth of production so the faster they ramp production uh the higher the depletion rate goes initially and when they cut production the depletion rate actually falls uh which is a little counterintuitive but that's just how the business works so right now they've high graded the wells uh a lot of the best acreage and you've got a depletion rate at the big the four biggest shale fields that are right now running around sixty percent per year five percent per month so at the same time uh a disproportionate percentage of conventional oil supplies uh come from a relatively few uh major oil fields uh that are now uh you know when you look at the list of super giant oil fields as matt simmons called them almost 20 years ago they are now all almost 50 somewhere between 55 and 100 years old and all of these fields uh almost all oil fields have have followed some version of a bell curve uh your ramp production uh your peak and then you start uh see production fall on the other side so people forgot about peachy boil because shale came in shale now looks like it's going to be harder and harder more expensive to keep it to keep growth flat or grow grow supply grow grow supplies excuse me and then i i think something that has really hit me in the last two three months is a really big signpost potentially has been audi who's owned by volkswagen the single biggest corporation in germany and the biggest employer in germany gm last week mercedes-benz these companies that have 60 to 80 years plus vested invested into internal combustion engine supply chains uh tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars invested into internal combustion supply chains and they're all now talking about taking significant portions or all of their production to electric vehicles within five years and so to me it just doesn't make sense it suggests there's two options number one these companies are willing to bet their companies on uh electric vehicles uh completely reorganize their massive supply chains on what amounts to basically betting the company on virtue signaling that's one option or the other option is there is a supply issue coming and these nation these companies by virtue of being as big as they are have been tapped on the shoulders by their governments saying hey start reorganizing your supply chains this is coming don't get caught by surprise and to me uh it's strange credulity that the ceo of a major automaker would bet his company on uh virtue signaling i just don't think that's that's how uh executives work so with that said to me i i think uh we're about to see pete g boyle come back as a major theme in a major way in coming quarters and years i think it's really good for oil prices i think it's really good for broad commodities i think it's really good for metals and particularly uh and industrials within the electron electric vehicle supply chain so that is the i took a little bit longer than two minutes but i think it's a pretty important thing to start paying an increased amount of attention to particularly since oil remains pretty hated a second question from pete at what point is the world going to realize that we have a fossil fuels energy return on invested energy in other words the amount of the number of oil barrels you have to invest to get a barrel of oil back that number uh a hundred years ago call it was you get a hundred barrels back for every barrel you invested so to speak and that number has been shrinking over time continues to shrink that's an er energy return on invested energy problem or e-r-o-i-e problem uh and then when that happens how long do you expect dollar reserve uh currency expected dollar reserve currency won't producers and commodity exporters want some sort of tangible wealth to represent declining reserves i think it's a great question i think it gets to the crux of a number of issues if keeping oil supplies flat to up slightly requires significant sustained ongoing increases in oil prices which is really what we're talking about when we talk about peak jeep oil then a nation would have to be to be blunt either an idiot or afraid of being invaded by the us uh to hold their national wealth in treasuries yielding negative real rates which is happening now but in particular uh holding it in treasuries when peach boil means those treasuries mathematically have to buy less oil every single year on average permanently and or at least until you find you get prices high enough that you can significantly ramp up oil production this is a problem in particular for europe china japan uh south korea as well which are creditor nations or regions that are also major oil importers uh and so you can't those those nations can't hold treasuries that lose seven eight ten fifteen percent of their value against oil every year because pretty soon they're gonna have a currency crisis because they won't have enough um uh the real wealth of their country relative to the critical import of oil uh will evaporate oh not not that in not too long a period of time uh to me that then to to address your question is that it means these these these energy importing creditor nations and regions are going to be highly motivated to shift their fx reserves out of treasuries out of sovereign debt more broadly into wealth assets that can rise to preserve oil purchasing power gold is really the only thing on the central bank list to buy that satisfies that you could also make a case uh that the uh swiss national bank buying equities also works as well japanese have done a little bit of that as well although i don't know that that's what their goal has been so uh for individuals i think bitcoin fits that list as well but i think that is a critical point to make in in looking at okay what are some of the broader macro implications of peak jeep oil next question from mt i would like you to discuss possible immediate catalysts for the fed to turn more dovish and acknowledge the debt situation and its implications for policy will another tightening slash deflationary bust cycle be needed before they get the message uh i think i think the the catalysts uh the possible catalysts that are needed are already in place you've seen the china credit impulse roll over we have the delta variant now we've got commodity prices rolling over um certainly relative to recent highs and so i don't think the fed is ever going to acknowledge the debt situation uh as in we are doing qe because the us's debt situation is unsustainable and we're keeping uh we're financing the government at negative real rates even though that's effectively what they're doing but ultimately in my opinion that's a key driver to to to to what it is and so the question then do we need another bust um possible but unlikely certainly not of of of a very long duration in my opinion and that ties into the next question from jp which is does the path of dollar devaluation matter as much as some people seem to think and in my opinion that depends on your mandate on your investment mandate so if you are a hedge fund or uh somebody who's managing or managing your own money uh on a monthly basis or even on a quarterly basis and a lot as a lot of mutual fund investors do uh it matters greatly absolutely i think it matters greatly the path of of how things play out for the dollar for what the fed does etc for an investor with a lower time preference which by the way i think is a huge advantage these days if you have if you can manage with a lower time preference than someone who has to manage monthly it's a huge advantage but if you have a lower time preference than managing monthly or quarterly then i don't think it matters i don't think the path of a dollar devaluation potentially matters that much uh and the reason i say that is since 2018 we've had sequentially shorter and shorter big drops down and risk off and the fed responding rapidly right so it was a quarter long and 4 q18 and then it was a few weeks long maybe a month long in summer of 19 and ultimately then or early 2020 with covet obviously it's very sharp but it was very brief um you know we had the shortest recession on record two months uh uh in 2020 as we just learned last week uh and so ultimately i think we're in the situation where uh the gaps from the time of of any sort of risk off to when the fed has to step in to keep the treasury market functioning which they have all but laid out as their new third mandate last year those gaps in time have to keep getting shorter and shorter and shorter from the time you have a self to the time the fed steps in the lower your time preference and this i think is critical lower your time preference in other words if you're not a monthly guy or a quarterly person uh managing to a monthly or quarterly mandate uh it simplifies your ques the decision process down to uh ultimately the longer your time horizon down to a single question which is do i think the fed will let the us government default on treasuries or entitlements and when i say default nominally default i mean we're not sending you the money we're not paying treasuries go away we're not paying entitlements go away and that's the question then the longer your time preference and in my view there's zero chance that i can never say zero there's very little chance of that happening uh i think there's it's highly unlikely i do not think the fed will allow that to happen and so then again that allows us to have uh um a greater time preference uh uh uh uh in terms of how we want to structure how we think about things and then the last question is from john luke uh if the u.s completely bans cryptocurrencies do you believe the signals that signals the formal end of us dominance as you've hinted in past fft reports or has anything changed in your view that either makes you think that banning is more or less likely in my opinion i continue to feel how i how i have felt which is to say i don't think the in my opinion that the u.s can outright ban uh cryptocurrencies bitcoin in particular um setting aside any of the mechanical technology aspects which uh in bitcoin in particular i think would be very difficult to do based on what uh some of my friends on the tech angle of that have told me with that said from the macro perspective i don't think the us can outright ban bitcoin because us dollar reserve status requires as it's been structured since 1971 it requires a completely open capital account uh however the us government can maintain a nominally open capital account and make things very difficult in the short run for owners of bitcoin as we've seen in the last uh three four months uh they can threaten regulatory uh uh uh impacts uh they can uh some of which might be good in the long run uh quite frankly they can do a number of things to make people uncomfortable um and we've seen that happen and i think i i don't think that will ultimately matter to bitcoin in the long run uh but in the short run i think it's something you have to be aware of so that's it for tonight i appreciate everybody's questions i hope everybody has a great rest of your weekend and as always if you're

so thank you for joining me first question comes from gr if you would please discuss in depth the path you see the fiscal stories taking what percentage drop in the stock market would cause the collaboration needed to bail out wall street uh i i think the easiest way to answer this look history is very clear uh over the last 200 to 220 years uh uh 52 out of the 53 countries that got to 130 debt to gdp like the u.s reached last year uh they had to either restructure their their debt their sovereign debt or inflated away especially when it's a twin deficit nation like the u.s there's no case of a twin deficit nation not either restructuring or inflating away their debt in terms of this happening however to your point it's a very political process so um you need to have political cover which obviously stock market drop is a very uh useful convenient has been used before um i would just expect to your point that that would be the cause again my view is a 15 to 20 percent drop in the s p from the highs would be enough uh to spur the fed to stop and possibly temporarily uh quote unquote re-increase qe uh to reverse the taper um that when you think about more fed qe with ongoing federal deficits that's effectively fiscal stimulus right there uh my guess is you'd probably need a 20 to 30 percent drawdown peak to trough for more fiscal to to scare washington uh into providing more fiscal or extending existing uh fiscal spending that is slated to go away whether that be student loan forbearance uh child tax credits uh etc um you know to be clear though i think too this isn't about bailing out wall street 2008 was about bailing out wall street um from now on this is about bailing out washington dc this is about bailing out entitlements this is about bailing out um 50 years of bad decisions uh starting around the time of nixon with closing the gold window uh in any series of particularly after 1989 after the soviet union fell a big uh reason detroit uh resounded a reason for existing uh for a lot of the apparatus for the europe petrodollar system we should have restructured the system at that point we didn't and so we've made us particularly since 89 a series of um horrifically bad foreign policy economic policy choices that were all generally slated toward um act now pay later act now pay later pull demand forward and the bills come and do and so that's what this is a bail this isn't about bailing out wall street anymore this is about bailing out all of us um so it's a little unsherry for right before the holidays but it is what it is second question from th jeff snyder as well as lacey hunt denies qe as money printing do you still disagree yes uh ben bernanke and fed vice chair stan fisher who was bernanke's mentor he was draghi's mentor um he is the godfather as one of my friends called it um as harold mamrum called him he's the ultimate behind the scenes actor this guy is tied in they were both extraordinarily clear on this point federal deficits spent into the economy with the fed engaged in qe is helicopter money i.e money printing i don't think this is particularly controversial the government hands money to people government issues a treasury to banks fed prints money buys the treasury from the bank there is a technicality that that is a bank reserves but again it's already leaked into the real economy via the government spending so unless the fed is going to completely reduce their balance sheet sell all those bonds back into the real economy someday which they say they will but they i mean they won't they can't then it's money printing if the fed doesn't shrink its balance sheet back down to its starting point it's money printing full stop and so um 2008 fed balance sheet was at 800 billion today it's at 8.4 trillion so unless um unless uh we're going the fed's going to be able to reduce its balance sheet by uh what is that 7.4 trillion dollars um sell those bonds back to the global private sector which makes me laugh there's there's no there's no frigging way uh to be blunt um then that's money printing de facto that is money printing so it's helicopter you can read it and ben bernanke's 2002 deflation speech uh you can read it from fed vice chair former fed vice chair stan fisher in 2019 in the black rock white paper august of 2019 both of these are publicly available google them find them online it's money printing it's helicopter money it's money printing deficits plus qe is money printing uh from jeff g if you had to choose fossil fuels or gold and by the way thanks so much for fftt i'll miss it the next three weeks thank you very much very kind jeff uh fossil fuels are gold both uh i i i want to own both i think it's important to understand from two angles number one gold is just energy it's compressed and and portable bitcoin is effectively the same uh gold and bitcoin are effectively batteries in that way just compressed portable energy uh gold at the sovereign level bitcoin for the people uh more importantly if we take a step back and look at peak cheap oil and gas which we're seeing peak cheap copper peak cheap a lot of resources uh which is becoming increasingly obvious um if you look at the data and the amount of evidence piling up it points to needing to uh that the commodities and neutral reserve assets should do well because ultimately uh peak cheap oil and gas and i'm just going to say that peak cheap a lot of commodities peak cheap oil and gas means the death of the traditional 60 40 stocks bond portfolio that's done so well for the last 30 to 40 years the reason that is is that if the fed tightens to try to fight commodity driven inflation then you're going to get modest modest amount of deflation but significant inflation at the back end again because you're not investing enough in energy and this other stuff like you should or if the fed doesn't tighten and lets inflation run hot for a sustain sustained period of time to both work down u.s debt but also to incent the private the global private market the global capitalist market to invest to address these higher prices then you're going to end up with very high prices later shortages later we're seeing shortages around the world of stuff this is no longer uh conspiracy theory tin foil hat stuff we're watching it de facto in europe in asia uh supply chains on the west coast uh etc so the fed is a choice cheap oil and gas means the fed is a choice a lot of inflation on a sustained basis now so that we don't have really bad inflation and shortages later or the fed can try to tighten for a little bit and fight this high inflation now and have really high inflation and shortages later high inflation now or really high inflation later isn't good for bonds either case and so in that case you want to hold a neutral reserve asset not bonds something that floats in value a bond of finite issuance and infinite duration with a floating face value something like gold that's all gold is it's a it's a it's a bond of zero percent coupon finite issuance and infinite duration um and so you want to own bonds with zero percent coupon floating face value and infinite duration uh uh that's gold that's bitcoin neutral reserve assets so i think you want to own both um for those reasons both fossil fuels and gold and bitcoin uh from valuable in a tweet response to macro alf you stated that other countries are not interested in treasuries anymore could you elaborate on this point could you also provide a point why that would not be the case as uh so uh what macro alf said was the u.s stock market represents 44 percent of world stock market cap despite u.s gdp representing less than 25 percent of cumulative gdp why do you think that's the case and i answered because the u.s runs the world's biggest deficits because we have to because we're the world's reserve currency issuer uh the world doesn't want nearly as many treasuries anymore and if i had more characters in twitter that's what i would have said i did say doesn't want treasuries anymore and so what the world's doing is recycling dollars back into u.s stocks instead in plain english what this means is that the post-71 structure of the u.s dollar triffins delamar which has always been known to be coming up is basically uh forcing uh the u.s to trade ownership of u.s stocks and real estate uh for cheap goods for china from china so china sends us cheap goods we send them dollars and instead of buying treasuries they buy stocks and they buy real estate so the reason i said the reason this is happening is is just geopolitical and economic realities you know per the math i ran through before uh regarding uh negative real rates uh etc um the math is clear the the us cannot pay back its debt in anything resembling real terms again once we get to 130 percent that the gdp 220 years of history you restructure or you inflate that's it and with rates already at zero basically uh there's no way to pay back the debt in anything resembling real terms especially when you factor in 110 100 trillion dollars plus in entitlement obligations which is just off balance sheet debt so treasuries have to be certificates of confiscation on a real basis and unlike uh unlike money managers who have to manage to a monthly mandate or a quarterly mandate um sovereigns don't have to manage to they can manage to a multi-year mandate that's very nice for them so uh foreign accreditors just don't see the value in u.s treasury bonds why would you buy a bond that has to yield negative real rates just for the u.s to keep the wheels on the car and the answer is you wouldn't you would buy stocks you'd buy real estate you'd buy gold and that's what they've been doing these foreign creditors have been doing that um and so uh the the you're seeing that in terms of um rising equities rising equities uh market cap as a percent of gdp we've seen that consistently uh you're seeing uh this it's been in rising peas obviously corporate earnings are rising as well but p e's are rising uh faster and and all of this is basically just a natural outcome and early warning of u.s deficit-driven inflation it starts in equities and then it spreads out so it also means that the dollar cannot be allowed to become too strong because foreigners are short dollars through dollar borrowing so dollar gets too strong they start selling u.s equities um to raise dollars uh and the whole system goes into reverse uh goes into a vicious cycle and that sends the us sends the world into recession uh and a recession when everybody's selling dollar related assets including treasuries and the u.s has record deficits to finance and at the gdp of 130 percent it's it's unsustainable you can't do it you would see yields and on treasuries rise into a recession it's called a balance of payments crisis when it happens in places like turkey as we're seeing in real time so um you know over time this turns the this the post 71 structure of the us dollar reserve status is turning the united states into a global tax haven um where the world buys our stocks uh plus we have some some some cool tech and we have shale and we have farms and that's an oversimplification but that's what this drives rather than sort of a more balanced economy geopolitically i didn't touch on that much but adversaries like china russia they would much rather buy gold in the case of russia or u.s equities and real estate in the case of china along with goal then they would own treasuries to finance their own military encirclement uh from nathan g is there a practical difference between the treasury minting a trillion dollar coin and the fed revaluing gold higher or do they effectively serve the same purpose a great question and no there's no effective difference both amount to a significant increase in the money supply without a commensurate increase in debt uh that could theoretically offset the increase in that money supply again remember what i said earlier if the fed buys that debt and never sells it it's money printing it's effectively the same thing if but there's at least the credible thing that snyder hunt others can point to say well that's debt they're gonna have to pay it back someday not if the fed's holding it um only if they want to uh only if it's politically convenient and 12 years and running 13 years of running hasn't been politically convenient has it over the state extended time frame it's not going to be either for the next 10 years in all likelihood uh so yeah effectively minting the coin and revaluing the gold uh on the balance sheet of the united states which then would deposit um whatever amount into the treasury tga treasury general account it's effectively the same thing it's basically money creation without offsetting debt and the final question from peter how did china manage to pop their equity bubble and keep it where they would like without causing recession why can't the usa do the same china is a major surplus nation with a closed capital account u.s is a twin deficit nation uh with an open capital account and the reserve currency u.s deficits recycled into the stock market in the way we talked about before that increases foreign ownership the u.s stock market policy makers as a result of in the us have increasingly allowed the system to evolve such that rising equity prices help create uh tax receipts uh consumer spending uh global demand um and so it means u.s government deficits uh need rising stocks to help fund so it's a giant to help fund it so it's it's a giant circular virtuous cycle uh contingent upon stocks going up into the right at infinite and so uh that and it's china and the us are in the same boat they're tied together at the hip with a very short rope so it's if u.s stocks fell yeah the u.s is going to recession but it ain't good for china either i mean it's going to drag on their economy as well they've been desperately trying to become much more domestic consumption driven they've made great strides in that however a u.s recession would still hurt them tremendously they still have a lot of capacity they have built that is export facing um and and would be negatively affected by a decline in the u.s stock market so it's uh it's a virtuous cycle but it's it or it's it's a it's a it's it's a virtuous cycle as long as stocks are rising china can in theory have more leeway they're less dependent uh they're less acutely dependent on rising u.s stocks but there still are dependent and china has other acute issues that the us does not have around energy and water so um a lot going on with that this is going to be the last video update for 2021 it's been an interesting year to say the least and i'm increasingly thinking 2022 may actually be a lot more interesting than 2021 uh in the broader sense of the word both fortunately unfortunately so let's watch for that as always if you like these updates please check out what we're up to fft llc.com you can look into our tree rings product which is uh 10 most interesting things um things that are grabbing our attention either they are surprising as positively negatively they make sense based on what we're seeing they don't make sense based on what we're seeing and always tying it back to different asset markets and sectors so get a lot of great feedback on that with that i'm going to sign off everybody i hope you have a wonderful holiday season merry christmas happy holidays uh and happy new year and we will see you all in 2022. take care everybody [music] you</td>\n",

looks like are gonna win we're gonna be four and one for the first time in a very long time i had a fun weekend out at the ball diamond even though my my kid did get robbed of a home run by the uh by a 20 mile an hour wind blowing in from right but what are you going to do the baseball godzilla so that's a good news we've also got a little bit of a changed background here we now in addition to mr x interviews volume one we have mr x interviews volume two so check it out if you haven't already i've gotten a lot of good reviews on it so with that we're gonna jump right into the questions here uh first off from kim finn twit in general seems to believe that gold is going to 5 000 but it will be a horrible world to live in quote unquote i i know you have the opposite view could you elaborate a bit yeah i'd be happy to um i i think it is possible there are scenarios where if we wake up one day in goals five thousand dollars per ounce that that it is possible it's there because things have gone very pear-shaped but my view is a little bit more optimistic in my opinion it it won't gold 5000 won't be terrible for the world the world won't be a terrible place to live and the reason i think that is 5 000 gold means that gold will be big enough the gold market will be big enough to be able to increasingly serve as a neutral reserve asset to settle trade globally which means that the uh the primary reserve asset of the past 49 years u.s treasury bonds will increasingly no longer be uh the primary reserve asset we've seen a little bit of this over the last 10 7 to 10 years seven years in particular in terms of gold taking share as a reserve asset from treasuries however if gold's at 5000 gold's going to take a lot more share from treasuries as primary reserve asset which means central banks aren't going to be buying as many treasuries which means the fed is going to have to buy them uh and they're gonna have to buy them with printed money and so that gets you a much weaker dollar since by virtue of the way the system worked for 50 years us has to run the biggest deficits to supply the dollars to the world so we the fed will be growing their balance sheet faster than every other central bank weakens the dollar and you get a much weaker dollar you're going to get stronger stronger global gdp is remember part of the bold case of the dollar is everyone's short dollar debt well if the dollar falls all that dollar debt gets easier to pay you're going to free up uh consumer spending around the world as the dollar the the cost of servicing dollar debt falls and this is something we saw in 2017 if you remember the dollar fell 12 percent 2017 coming into 2018 uh many strategists were uh admiring the global global coordinated growth we had in early 2018 uh and that global coordinated growth promptly stopped and reversed as soon as a dollar bottomed it began rising again so uh ultimately the the reason we think five thousand dollar gold would be positive is is gold would be gaining a lot of share from treasuries the fed would have to be buying a lot more treasuries with printed money weakening the dollar strengthening global growth and as the dollar weakens by the way you're going to have more on shoring uh of reshoring of manufacturing etc which is also a good thing for the u.s so uh that's why i say i think people would be shocked by how good the world could be with five thousand dollar gold next question iran and the yuan it came out this weekend that iran said the yuan is our primary currency now no longer the dollar to me i had several questions on it to me this is not a shocking announcement at all uh it is probably at least in no small part driven by ongoing sanctions that are going on eight years plus uh between the united states or the united states has put on iran i would argue there's a little bit of a chicken and egg question in terms of is iran moving the yuan because of the sanctions or are the sanctions on iran because they've been trying to move that you want them for years at any rate two thousand number one it's gonna be really hard for china to run out of dollars to buy iranian oil if china can buy it and you want that's important for the china's you know chinese yuan has to fall because they're to run out of dollars case um they can't run out of dollars for iranian oil anymore uh and then the second important thing is something we've harped on a lot i think it's a very important point is that if the marginal barrel of oil in the world is priced in yuan which it is and this is just further proof that it is then because as i've said before as a cfo of one of the biggest trading firms commodity trading firms in the world told me 10 years ago 15 years ago in commodities the marginal ton price is the whole the marginal ton of yuan is priced or a marginal ton of oil is priced in yuan instead of dollars then all of a sudden if the us wants the price of oil higher it's got to get the dollar down and so again this is something else that i think is an important dynamic to understand how and why that works third question from cm if biden wins and republicans hold the senate it's possible they could turn fiscally conservative and refuse to play ball on further stimulus packages how would you see this affecting the dollar the price of gold etc so the short version of it i would say is if that situation plays out which i think is possible if it plays out and stimulus is held up positive for the dollar negative for stocks negative for gold at least in the near term uh basically another scenario like we saw in march that said uh in my opinion fiscal conservativism is not is unlikely to last very long once it is pointed out to those same let's say that the uh the republicans do hold the senate and they decide to uh want to be fiscal conservatives i think they're going to want to be fiscal conservatives right up to the point where somebody points out to them that the us is either going to have to slash the defense spending to make the books to make the books balance or or to make the math work and obviously conservatives aren't going to slash defense spending number two slash entitlements uh and conservatives aren't going to slash entitlements because nobody in congress is going to slash entitlements because that's how you get uh voted out of office or number three nominally default on treasuries and conservatives aren't going to default on tracy she's not going to vote for that and why do i why are those the only two things those are the big three expenditures uh i didn't do that the big three expenditures uh those big three expenditures are now 140 of tax receipts in the united states in 2020 just that entitlements defense and interest expense and so when you look at that what you see is those are the only things they can cut that would make a difference if you don't do the stimulus covet blew the budget up full stop and so in my opinion fiscal conservativism is probably dead for years uh there may be threats of fiscal conservativism but as i said once they get sat down and said oh you want to call the pentagon and tell them you're slashing their budget or you want to tell the treasury market that you're not making the interest payment this month or you want to call tell tell 70 million baby boomer voters that that you're cutting their benefit it's not going to happen in my view so that's why i say i think any threats of fiscal conservativism from either side are to me likely to be very brief at most uh third question from mc seems like we're heading for a big shift from monetary to fiscal stimulus or fiscal policy do you think this creates the pos the potential excuse me for real growth uh and the value rotation rotation resulting from higher real rates uh so i agree we're heading for a big shift i think it's already underway in the early innings of a shift from monetary driving the boat to fiscal drive in the boat with that difference just being instead of the fed driving uh the economy it's basically u.s fiscal spending uh monetized by the fed uh i don't know that it'll drive real growth if we define real growth as uh growth in excess of inflation i don't think that that's likely to happen i think the playbook here is nominal growth and that's all you need when you've got debt to gdp at 135 percent at the federal level in the united states it's no longer about real growth it's just drive nominal growth and then the federal pin yields wherever they have to pin yields by growing their balance sheet and basically us treasury holders are going to be stuck with the bill um so we saw this in uh the aftermath of world war ii the last time u.s federal debt to gdp was this high we saw um uh nominal gdp growth ran 500 to 800 basis points above the nominal yield on 10-year u.s treasury bonds for the better part of 35 years and basically it was a long-term thank you for your donation treasury holders uh to recapitalize in the united states in that time that the gdp went from 100 plus back down to about 30 percent by 1980. um so uh in i don't the the long-winded way of saying uh i think it could bode very well for certain value names i think industrials uh would benefit from this i think they've maybe started to see a little bit of this i still think big tech works even though that's been sort of a growth slash duration trade and positive real rates i don't think is happening for a long long time um now could it happen in a very for a brief period of time uh sure uh and that's not that's gonna be an environment where you want to own dollars and basically nothing else uh but again that will positive real rates will force the united states to either slash defense slash entitlements or default on treasuries and none of those three things are happening and so the fed will in my view move heaven and earth to keep real rates negative and i for a long time and probably increasingly negative so that's that last point there and then the last question had a number of people ask me about the outlook for precious metals as well as stocks into your end and the answer here is it's intellectually offensive uh but i think it depends heavily on fiscal stimulus and i think it depends on the election outcome and if we get the stimulus i think you have to have a positive outlook on precious metals and stocks and i think if you don't uh then i think uh it basically is the beatings will continue until morale improves in other words uh you know dollar up precious metals and stocks down until uh congress can be convinced that they need that stimulus now to me i know it might be very instructive given we saw last week which is president trump said no deal at 3 54 pm and by 6 54 p.m he was tweeting out basically crying uncle i'm willing to talk i'm willing to send 1200 bucks i'm willing to do the airline deal please call me nancy pelosi uh and i think that's simply because he saw what happened to stocks he saw what happened to the dollar he saw what happened stocks i think the big one so stocks effectively are the economy now at 160 percent of gdp in terms of total equity market cap and for other reasons we've discussed before so i'm going to leave it at that uh as always check us out at fftt-llc.com for what we're up to and future appearances and if you like these updates uh please check out fftt tree rings it's a 10 most interesting things piece that we put together every friday for our subscribers uh uh 10 most interesting things we've seen

       "      <td>[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hello everybody luke groman fft hope everybody had a great weekend i will say it was probably one of the nicest weekends of the year here in cleveland just absolutely perfect weather and to boot my cleveland browns one today making them two in one which means they are above 500 for the first time in 84 games so if we're looking for signs of the apocalypse uh or or something big happening maybe we could start there so at any rate just got back a little bit ago from throwing batting practice to my son so uh i'm good and loosened up ready to go here tonight so let's jump right in uh first question how likely are we to see an increase in monetary velocity sufficient enough to cause a meaningful jump in inflation what would what would cause that increase and when would you expect it considering unemployment is still near the 08 peak and bankruptcies are at a 10-year high to me it depends heavily if not entirely on what the fiscal side in other words what the government spends in deficits in conjunction with the monetary side what the fed does when we saw the u.s government deficits spend and basically hand money out from call it april through july and the fed effectively monetized most or all of that we saw inflation we didn't and so i think the important thing here to understand as it relates to this ongoing inflation discussion is it's a it's almost an entirely a political decision it's subject to u.s political processes but given u.s fiscal situation in my opinion we'll see more aggressive fiscal spending post-election now when i say it's almost exclusively a fiscal uh decision a political process what do i mean let's take an extreme example in theory if we can get through the political side of it let's pretend i hand out a trillion dollars a week for the next 52 weeks or 2 trillion a week let's say we hand out 2 trillion a week for the next 52 weeks so we're going to the government is going to run 2 trillion dollar deficits per week for the next 52 weeks there should be 104 trillion dollars injected into the economy over the next uh next 52 weeks i assure you we would see inflation uh the dollar wouldn't like it much and but we would see inflation and this to me i think is an important point that a lot of people are missing they're looking for inflation solely from uh monetary velocity from bank lending but you can have inflation come from currency depreciation without bank land we saw that in the 70s it was called stagflation uh the dollar falls enough and and it's given that we import as much as we do we would start to see inflation so ultimately you know crisis or not in my opinion excuse me if we have a crisis or not first that we need to get this type of spending post-election that to me is the key question at this point is what i was trying to say i'm not sure the crisis needed to spur this type of post-election spending is as big as a lot of people think though so let's jump into the next question here opinions on markets and gold and how it plays out into the election is there a potential potential deflationary bust across all assets with a biden win with the hike in capital gains tax rates in my opinion it depends you know on the fiscal side here uh do we get fiscal spending and stimulus before the election or do we not if we don't then i think we probably get a risk off if we do then i think you want to own stocks and gold i'm not sure who wins or loses matters as much as many people think um kovids pushed the u.s into a an acute fiscal crisis that really started a year ago with the repo rate spike that was when the u.s fiscal crisis went to cute and i think it became largely irrecoverable without mmt-like policies once coveted hit so i don't think the u.s government has nearly enough operating room to actually have a lot of difference between republicans and democrats in this election i know there's people talking about the capital gains tax hikes from biden i don't think that would be positive for stocks i think it could cause a risk off if he sticks by his if he wins and sticks by his guns during the lame duck period before he's in office but ultimately i would see it as a buying opportunity because i think he's going to get an office and they're going to sit him down run through the numbers and he's going to quickly realize that i think a capital gains tax that caused stocks to fall would actually lead to a lowering of tax receipts not an increase capital gains and asset price appreciation are so critical to driving us gdp u.s consumer spending that if stocks fell as a result of a capital gains tax you would likely actually see a decline in overall tax receipts uh not an increase with a capital gains tax increase so i don't think uh ultimately on the ones who if biden gets in i don't think he's going to implement that next question in light of recent events has the market properly priced in geopolitical risk as in dimitri coffinas we may be at greater risk of annihilation today like the pre the period pre-1914 the western world has become accustomed to peace and prosperity prosperity complacency combined with a revolution in technology of war making has led has laid the groundwork for the most destructive war in human history i agree the market's not pricing in geopolitical risk um i think that is partly because of a pre-1914 like attitude that the world is too interconnected to allow this to happen um and so i do think that tail risk assets or assets that would do well it's just further uh fuel you need to some gold you need some bitcoin you need some cash in your portfolio however i don't think a a global war is likely either and the reason i think that is is because the vulnerabilities of both china and the united states are so great and so immediate that were a conflict to break out like that i think it would quickly go nuclear and by that i mean the vulnerabilities the u.s would shut off china's food and oil supply the chinese would shut off the us's antibiotics and drug supply and you'd have tens of millions in each site dying probably within the first several months and so both sides will be desperate enough it'll go nuclear in my view and as a result i just don't think it's very much of an investable scenario um and so i do think you can see headlines geopolitical risk i just don't think a another world war as it were world war one world war ii is very likely so let's see here lastly here and short-term expectations on the dollar and the corollary your short-term expectations on gold and silver are you a short-term dollar bull ah i guess i guess the reason i say that is is look it's just a recognition of the machinery that's at work the us fiscal crisis has gone acute as we just described as a result of cobit and so either the us fiscal stimulus and the fed monetizes enough of it uh or they don't uh and if they don't the dollar is likely to remain bit as we've seen over the last two to three weeks in particular ultimately the dollar can't rise very far without breaking markets up to and including the treasury market and the united states is not going to let the treasury market break full stop we saw that march when the fed said that the treasury market effectively uh ceased functioning and uh we got 600 billion dollars a week in in qe so and then the dollar went from 102 to 92 in four months and so that's what i mean by they're not going to let that happen and so um ultimately have i sold any gold no have i sold any bitcoin no i'm i'm still buying gold and bitcoin uh they're still my two favorite assets even though i'm cognizant that in the short run uh the dollar technically looks good uh gold and and and bitcoin look like they're a little bit soft technically um ultimately i think the big takeaway and i'll leave you with this for tonight is we are living through the bursting of the first global sovereign debt bubble in 100 years we are living through the first changeover of a currency system in at least 50 years going back to 1971. these types of things are very difficult to trade and they're very difficult to trade on leverage dan oliver had a great chart uh earlier this year my friend at murmican capital and what he highlighted was that dur from 1914 to 1923 in the weimar republic uh the price of gold basically went to infinity and so the trade looks like borrow as much as you can buy gold and then the gold rises and pays off your debt problem was is the volatility was so great that you lost all your money four or five different times before gold went to infinity in in weimar mark terms and so my point here is is that i think you want to be unlevered and i think you want to be very careful about trying to trade a one the bursting of a 100 uh the first global sovereign debt bubble 100 years and the first currency system change in 50 years uh it's likely to be extremely difficult to do so i think you want to own the assets that are likely to win i think we've spent 50 years being asked what's what's the most levered way to play this given the bursting of the sovereign debt bubble and the change over the system i don't i think the question is no longer what's the most levered way to play this i think the question is becoming what's the best unlevered way to play this and to me that remains gold yes uh bitcoin silver and so i will finish with that uh as always check out fftt llc.com for more information about what we're up to and if you like these
